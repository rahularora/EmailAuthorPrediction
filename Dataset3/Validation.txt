THE SONNETS

by William Shakespeare



                     1
  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  But as the riper should by time decease,
  His tender heir might bear his memory:
  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Making a famine where abundance lies,
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.



                     3
  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
  Now is the time that face should form another,
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.



                     6  
  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
  That use is not forbidden usury,
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.



                     7
  Lo in the orient when the gracious light
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,  
  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
  From his low tract and look another way:
    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.



                     9
  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
  The world will be thy widow and still weep,
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
  When every private widow well may keep,
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.



                     15
  When I consider every thing that grows
  Holds in perfection but a little moment.

  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.



                     17
  Who will believe my verse in time to come
  If it were filled with your most high deserts?
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:  
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
  The age to come would say this poet lies,
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.



                     20
  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.

  And for a woman wert thou first created,
  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.



                     21  
  So is it not with me as with that muse,
  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Making a couplement of proud compare
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.

  O let me true in love but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
  As any mother's child, though not so bright
  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
  
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
  As I not for my self, but for thee will,
  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.

    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.



                     24
  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  And perspective it is best painter's art.



                     26  
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
  To thee I send this written embassage
  To witness duty, not to show my wit.
  
  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.



                     31  
  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
  And all those friends which I thought buried.

    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.



                     35
  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.

  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
  And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our lives a separable spite,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.

  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.



                     37
  As a decrepit father takes delight,
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.

  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.

  And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
    But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.



                     49
  Against that time (if ever that time come)
  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Called to that audit by advised respects,
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
  When love converted from the thing it was
  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time do I ensconce me here
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,  
    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.



                     50
  How heavy do I journey on the way,
  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
  Doth teach that case and that repose to say
  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.
  
  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  Since seldom coming in that long year set,
  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.

  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  To make some special instant special-blest,
  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.



                     54
  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  But for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
  Die to themselves.
 Sweet roses do not so,
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:  
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.



                     56  
  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.

  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
  Save where you are, how happy you make those.

  That I might see what the old world could say,
  To this composed wonder of your frame,
  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
  Or whether revolution be the same.

  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.



                     61  
  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.

  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.

  When I have seen such interchange of State,
  Or state it self confounded, to decay,
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
  That Time will come and take my love away.



                     71  
  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay if you read this line, remember not,
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.



                     74
  But be contented when that fell arrest,
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.

  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  The very part was consecrate to thee,
  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
  My spirit is thine the better part of me,
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body being dead,
  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
  Too base of thee to be remembered,  
    The worth of that, is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.



                     76  
  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Why with the time do I not glance aside
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  O know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument:
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.

    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
  
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.

  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
  That to his subject lends not some small glory,
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
  That you are you, so dignifies his story.
  
    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.

  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.



                     97
  How like a winter hath my absence been
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  What old December's bareness everywhere!  
  And yet this time removed was summer's time,
  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  And thou away, the very birds are mute.



                     99
  The forward violet thus did I chide,
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.

  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  But that wild music burthens every bough,
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.

  Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand  
  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.

  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.

  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.

    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.

  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.

    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    That all the world besides methinks are dead.



                     114
  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
  Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
  Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
  To make of monsters, and things indigest,
  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  Creating every bad a perfect best
  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
  O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,  
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.

  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.



                     118
  Like as to make our appetite more keen
  With eager compounds we our palate urge,
  As to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.

  Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,  
  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.



                     119
  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  Still losing when I saw my self to win!
  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  O benefit of ill, now I find true
  That better is, by evil still made better.



                     123
  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
  They are but dressings Of a former sight:
  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  And rather make them born to our desire,  
  Than think that we before have heard them told:
  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
  Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
  Made more or less by thy continual haste:
    This I do vow and this shall ever be,
    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

  No it was builded far from accident,
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
  It fears not policy that heretic,
  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
  But all alone stands hugely politic,  
  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.



                     125
  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  With my extern the outward honouring,
  Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
  But mutual render, only me for thee.

  To be so tickled they would change their state  
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.



                     130
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
  And in some perfumes is there more delight,
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

    And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.

  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.

  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
  Among a number one is reckoned none.

  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  Though in thy store's account I one must be,
  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.

  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?  
  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told.



                     139
  O call not me to justify the wrong,
  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
  What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,  
    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.



                     140
  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.



                     141
  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,  
  For they in thee a thousand errors note,
  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.



                     142
  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,  
  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.



                     145
  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  To me that languished for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
  Was used in giving gentle doom:
  And taught it thus anew to greet:
  'I hate' she altered with an end,
  That followed it as gentle day,
  Doth follow night who like a fiend
  From heaven to hell is flown away.



                     148
  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,  
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then though I mistake my view,
  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.

  For thou betraying me, I do betray
  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.

  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
  Or made them swear against the thing they see.

    For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
    To swear against the truth so foul a be.



                     154
  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
  The fairest votary took up that fire,
  Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
  And so the general of hot desire,
  Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.

 In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

  COUNTESS.
 This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature  
    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work.

  LAFEU.
 He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
 I have those hopes of her good that her education
    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
    too.

  LAFEU.

  COUNTESS.
 I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

  LAFEU.
 If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
    soon mortal.

  LAFEU.
 What heaven more will,
    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell.
 And you, monarch!
  PAROLLES.
 Ay.
 Keep him out.

  PAROLLES.
 I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
    virgin.
 Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't.
 That I wish well.

 Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

  PAROLLES.
 Why under Man?
  HELENA.

  PAROLLES.
 When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
 Why think you so?
  HELENA.
 You go so much backward when you fight.

  PAROLLES.
 So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
    composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
    a good wing, and I like the wear well.
 SCENE 2.
 The KING'S palace

Flourish of cornets.

  KING.
 His love and wisdom,
    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.

  BERTRAM.
 My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
 Who were below him
    He us'd as creatures of another place;
    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility
    In their poor praise he humbled.
 His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.

  KING.
 If he were living, I would try him yet-
    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
    With several applications.
 Thank your Majesty.
 The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN

  COUNTESS.
 Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
    when of ourselves we publish them.

  CLOWN.

  COUNTESS.
 Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
  CLOWN.
 I do beg your good will in this case.

  CLOWN.
 I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.

  CLOWN.

  COUNTESS.
 He that comforts my wife is the
    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and  
    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend.
 Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
  CLOWN.
 A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:

              For I the ballad will repeat,
                Which men full true shall find:
              Your marriage comes by destiny,
                Your cuckoo sings by kind.
 What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.

  CLOWN.
 You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

 Exit
  COUNTESS.
 Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
    much love as she finds.
 Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
    wish'd me.
 Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
    touch'd not any stranger sense.

    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.

  HELENA.

    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
    Methought you saw a serpent.

    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
    That this distempered messenger of wet,
    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?  
    Why, that you are my daughter?
  HELENA.
 I say I am your mother.

    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
    So strive upon your pulse.
 Speak, is't so?
    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
    To tell me truly.
 Good madam, pardon me.

  COUNTESS.
 Do not you love him, madam?
  COUNTESS.
 But think you, Helen,
    If you should tender your supposed aid,
    He would receive it? He and his physicians
    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
    They, that they cannot help.
 I'll stay at home,
    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
 And you, my lords, farewell;
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
    And is enough for both.
 No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege.
 Farewell, young lords;
    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come  
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you aloud.
 Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
  KING.
 Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
    They say our French lack language to deny,
    If they demand; beware of being captives
    Before you serve.

    BOTH.

                                       The KING retires attended
  FIRST LORD.
 Most admirable! I have seen those wars.

  BERTRAM.

  FIRST LORD.
 I am your accessary; and so farewell.
 I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
 Be more
    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
    the measure, such are to be followed.

  PAROLLES.
  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

  LAFEU.
 Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.

    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
 Good faith, across!
    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
    Of your infirmity?
  KING.

  KING.

  LAFEU.
 Nay, I'll fit you,
    And not be all day neither.
 This haste hath wings indeed.

  LAFEU.
 Fare you well.
 Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  HELENA.
 Ay, my good lord.
 The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
    Knowing him is enough.

  HELENA.
  
    He that of greatest works is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest minister.
 I must not hear thee.
 Fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

  KING.

    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
 Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
    His powerful sound within an organ weak;
    And what impossibility would slay
    In common sense, sense saves another way.
 Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What husband in thy power I will command.

    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
 I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught.
 It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.

  COUNTESS.
 Ask me
    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
 O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off.

  COUNTESS.
 I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

  CLOWN.
 Not much employment for you.

Paris.
 Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
    ourselves to an unknown fear.
 To be relinquish'd of the artists-
  PAROLLES.

  LAFEU.
 Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
  PAROLLES.

  LAFEU.
 Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
 Uncertain life and sure death.
 If you will have it in showing, you shall
    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.

  LAFEU.
 Generally thankful.

  KING.


                     Enter three or four LORDS

    Fair maid, send forth thine eye.
 We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

  HELENA.
 Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream.
 Sir, will you hear my suit?
  FIRST LORD.

  HELENA.

  HELENA.

  LAFEU.

  HELENA.

  HELENA.

  FOURTH LORD.
 Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
 My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
    In such a business give me leave to use
    The help of mine own eyes.
 Yes, my good lord;  
    But never hope to know why I should marry her.

  KING.
 Honours thrive
    When rather from our acts we them derive
    Than our fore-goers.

  BERTRAM.

  BERTRAM.
 The solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
    Expecting absent friends.
 My master!
  LAFEU.

  PAROLLES.
 You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
    old.
  
  PAROLLES.
 Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  LAFEU.

  LAFEU.
 If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage.
 I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
    age will give me leave.
 Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
    is no fettering of authority.
 I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.


                         Re-enter LAFEU

  LAFEU.
 I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
    reservation of your wrongs.

  LAFEU.

  LAFEU.
 I think thou wast created for men to breathe
    themselves upon thee.

  PAROLLES.
 Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
  PAROLLES.
 What's the matter, sweetheart?
  BERTRAM.
 There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
    not yet.
 Ay, that would be known.
 To other regions!
    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
    Therefore, to th' war!
  BERTRAM.
 Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it.
 My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  CLOWN.
 She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
    merry, but yet she is not well.
 So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
    did as you say.
 Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

  CLOWN.
 You have it from his own deliverance.

  BERTRAM.
 I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
    and accordingly valiant.
 O, I know him well.

  LAFEU.

    God save you, Captain.

    Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
    tame, and know their natures.
 Here comes my clog.
 I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
    Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
    For present parting; only he desires
    Some private speech with you.

                                               [Giving a letter]
    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
    I leave you to your wisdom.
 Let that go.

  HELENA.
 I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
    What law does vouch mine own.

 So that, from point to point, now have you hear

    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    And more thirsts after.
 Holy seems the quarrel
    Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
    On the opposer.
 Good my lord,
    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
    But like a common and an outward man
    That the great figure of a council frames
    By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
    Say what I think of it, since I have found

 Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose

 You shall not need to fear me.

    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
  HELENA.
 At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.

 Hark you! They come this way.
 His name, I pray you.

  DIANA.
 The Count Rousillon.
 He does, indeed;
    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
    But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
    In honestest defence.
 Which is the Frenchman?

 Is't not a handsome gentleman?

  FIRST LORD.

  FIRST LORD.
 When your lordship sees the bottom
    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
 Here he comes.
 That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
    have prevented, if he had been there to command.

    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
    be recovered.
 It is to be recovered.

  PAROLLES.
 By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

  BERTRAM.
 But you must not now slumber in it.

  BERTRAM.
 I love not many words.
 Is not this a strange
    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
 Certain it is  
    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
    you have him ever after.

  FIRST LORD.
 We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.

  SECOND LORD.
 I should believe you;
    For you have show'd me that which well approves
    Y'are great in fortune.
 Let her in fine consent,
    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
 A ring the County wears
    That downward hath succeeded in his house
    From son to son some four or five descents
    Since the first father wore it.
 This ring he holds
    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
    Howe'er repented after.
 You see it lawful then.
 He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.

  SECOND LORD.
 Now he hath a smack of all
    neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
    his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
    seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
    gabble enough, and good enough.
 Ten o'clock.
 Within these three hours 'twill be time
    enough to go home.
 They begin to smoke me;
    and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door.
 I find my
    tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
    before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
    tongue.
 What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
    say I got them in exploit.
 Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put  
    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

  BERTRAM.
 No.
 How have I sworn!
  DIANA.

    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
    But take the High'st to witness.
 Then, pray you, tell me:
    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
    To swear by him whom I protest to love
    That I will work against him.
 Therefore your oaths
    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
    At least in my opinion.
 Love is holy;
    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with.

  BERTRAM.

  DIANA.

  DIANA.
 For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
    You may so in the end.
 He hath given her his monumental ring,
    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
 Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,  
    what things are we!
  FIRST LORD.
 And as in the common course of
    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows
    himself.
 That approaches apace.

  FIRST LORD.
 We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    presence must be the whip of the other.
 Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
    house.
 Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last
    breath, and now she sings in heaven.
 The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
    makes her story true even to the point of her death.
 Hath the Count all this intelligence?
  SECOND LORD.
 Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
    point, to the full arming of the verity.
 He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
    a solemn leave.
 The
    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.

  BERTRAM.
 No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his
    spurs so long.
 But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
    stocks.

  SECOND LORD.
 Boblibindo chicurmurco.
' What say you to that?
  PAROLLES.
 Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
 What a past-saving slave is this!
  SECOND LORD.

  FIRST LORD.
 I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
    apparel neatly.
 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or
    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
 He's very near the truth in this.
 A truth's a truth-the rogues are
    marvellous poor.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Demand them singly.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  PAROLLES.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
    camp?
  PAROLLES.

    I think I have his letter in my pocket.
 In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it
    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
 Our interpreter does it well.

  BERTRAM.

  FIRST LORD.
 This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold  
    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
 I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
    fain to hang you.

  PAROLLES.
 He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
    and ravishments he parallels Nessus.
 He has everything
    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
    have he has nothing.
 What say you to his expertness in war?
  PAROLLES.

  SECOND LORD.
 I'll whisper with the General, and know his
    pleasure.

  PAROLLES.
  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming.

    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the  
    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
    you must die.
 That shall you, and take your leave of all your
    friends.
 Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
 You must know
    I am supposed dead.

  WIDOW.
 So lust doth play
    With what it loathes, for that which is away.

ACT IV SCENE 5.
 Your daughter-in-law
    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
    of.
 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady.
 I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in
    grass.
  
  LAFEU.
 Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
  CLOWN.

  LAFEU.
 So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

  CLOWN.
 I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
 At your service.
 Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
    prince as you are.
 Who's that? A Frenchman?
  CLOWN.
 What prince is that?
  CLOWN.
 The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
    the devil.
 But, sure, he
    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court.

  LAFEU.
 Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
    so before, because I would not fall out with thee.
 If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.

  LAFEU.
 And I was about to tell
    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to  
    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
    first propose.
 How does your ladyship like it?
  COUNTESS.
 With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily
    effected.
 His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.

  COUNTESS.
 Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
    admitted.
 O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
    on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet
    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet.

                                                          Exeunt

 You remember

  BERTRAM.
 Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
  LAFEU.
 My gracious sovereign,
    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
    The ring was never hers.
 Son, on my life,
    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
    At her life's rate.
 She never saw it.
 Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
    Which I would fain shut out.
 Gracious sovereign,
    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,  
    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
    To tender it herself.
 He stole from Florence, taking no leave,
    and I follow him to his country for justice.

    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
    Was foully snatch'd.

    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
    Yet you desire to marry.

  WIDOW.
 I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
    And both shall cease, without your remedy.
  
  KING.

  LAFEU.
 Good my lord,
    Ask him upon his oath if he does think
    He had not my virginity.
 She's impudent, my lord,
    And was a common gamester to the camp.
 o, behold this ring,
    Whose high respect and rich validity
    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
    If I be one.
 This is his wife:
    That ring's a thousand proofs.

  DIANA.
 She got the ring;  
    And I had that which any inferior might
    At market-price have bought.
 I pray you yet-
    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-
    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
    And give me mine again.

  KING.
 The story, then, goes false you threw it him
    Out of a casement.
 My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
 You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.

  KING.
 How, I pray you?
  PAROLLES.
 As thou art a knave and no knave.
 Ay, my good lord.
 It was not lent me neither.
 It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
 By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
 Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
 She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.

    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.

  BERTRAM.
 Both, both; o, pardon!
  HELENA.
 O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
    I found you wondrous kind.

 Grates me the sum.
 Perchance? Nay, and most like,
    You must not stay here longer; your dismission
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
  
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
    Call in the messengers.
 Antony
    Will be himself.

 Your will?

 Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
    Cleopatra's health to drink.
 Good, sir, give me good fortune.

    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

 Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

 Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
 Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I

 Amen.
 Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!

                          Enter CLEOPATRA

  ENOBARBUS.
 Hush! Here comes Antony.
 Not he; the Queen.
 Was he not here?
  CHARMIAN.
 Here, at your service.
 My lord approaches.


          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants

  CLEOPATRA.
 Against my brother Lucius?
  MESSENGER.

    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
    Whose better issue in the war from Italy
    Upon the first encounter drave them.
 The nature of bad news infects the teller.

  ANTONY.
 Labienus-
    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia,
    Whilst-
  ANTONY.
 At your noble pleasure.


                 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter

    What are you?
  SECOND MESSENGER.

    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this bears.
 Forbear me.
 Under a compelling occasion, let women die.
 She is cunning past man's thought.

  ANTONY.
 Would I had never seen her!
  ENOBARBUS.
 Fulvia is dead.

  ENOBARBUS.
 For not alone
    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
    Of many our contriving friends in Rome
    Petition us at home.
 Sextus Pompeius
    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands  
    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
    The sides o' th' world may danger.
 Quick, and return.
        Exit ALEXAS
  CHARMIAN.
 What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN.
 In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
 Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.

    What says the married woman? You may go.

  ANTONY.
 The gods best know-
  CLEOPATRA.
 O, never was there queen
    So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
    I saw the treasons planted.
 Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
    But bid farewell, and go.

  ANTONY.
 The condemn'd Pompey,
    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
    By any desperate change.

  CLEOPATRA.
 She's dead, my Queen.

    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
    The garboils she awak'd.
 By the fire
    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
    As thou affects.

  ANTONY.
 My precious queen, forbear,
    And give true evidence to his love, which stands
    An honourable trial.
 You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
 Still he mends;
    But this is not the best.

  CLEOPATRA.
 But that your royalty
    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
    For idleness itself.
 Come.
 CAESAR'S house

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train

  CAESAR.
 You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
    Our great competitor.
 From Alexandria
    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
    Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners.
 I must not think there are
    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
 Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness.
 Pompey is strong at sea,
    And it appears he is belov'd of those
    That only have fear'd Caesar.
 To the ports
    The discontents repair, and men's reports
    Give him much wrong'd.

  MESSENGER.
 Caesar, I bring thee word
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound  
    With keels of every kind.
 Pompey
    Thrives in our idleness.

  CAESAR.
 CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

  CLEOPATRA.
 Charmian!
  CHARMIAN.

  CHARMIAN.
 Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA.
 What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA.

    Yet have I fierce affections, and think
    What Venus did with Mars.
 Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison.
 Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;  
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
  ALEXAS.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Mine ear must pluck it thence.
 O well-divided disposition! Note him,
    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.

    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
    The violence of either thee becomes,
    So does it no man else.
 Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
    Say 'the brave Antony.
 By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
    If thou with Caesar paragon again
    My man of men.

 Know, worthy Pompey,
    That what they do delay they not deny.
 Caesar gets money where  
    He loses hearts.
 Where have you this? 'Tis false.

  MENAS.

    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
    Not mov'd by Antony.

    Come, Menas.

SCENE II.
 Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
    To soft and gentle speech.

  LEPIDUS.

  ENOBARBUS.
 I do not know, Maecenas.
 Ask Agrippa.
 Welcome to Rome.

  ANTONY.
 Sit, sir.
 I learn you take things ill which are not so,
    Or being, concern you not.
 You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
    By what did here befall me.
 If you'll patch a quarrel,
    As matter whole you have not to make it with,
    It must not be with this.
 As for my wife,
    I would you had her spirit in such another!
    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

  CAESAR.
 I wrote to you
    When rioting in Alexandria; you
    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
    Did gibe my missive out of audience.

  CAESAR.

  LEPIDUS.
 If it might please you to enforce no further
    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
    Were to remember that the present need
    Speaks to atone you.

  ENOBARBUS.
  
  ENOBARBUS.
 That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

  ENOBARBUS.
 I am not married, Caesar.
 By this marriage
    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
    Would then be nothing.
 I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
    Of late upon me.
 I must thank him only,
    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
    At heel of that, defy him.

    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
 Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS.
 Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
    the night light with drinking.
 Is this true?
  ENOBARBUS.
 This was but as a fly by an eagle.

  MAECENAS.

  ENOBARBUS.
 The city cast
    Her people out upon her; and Antony,
    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
    And made a gap in nature.
 Our courteous Antony,
    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
    And for his ordinary pays his heart
    For what his eyes eat only.

  ENOBARBUS.
 CAESAR'S house

Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them

  ANTONY.
 All which time
    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
    To them for you.

    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by th' rule.
 Good night, dear lady.
 Good night, sir.
                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA

                        Enter SOOTHSAYER

  ANTONY.

    Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd.
 Speak this no more.
 To none but thee; no more but when to thee.

    If thou dost play with him at any game,
    Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
    He beats thee 'gainst the odds.
 If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds.


                       Enter VENTIDIUS

    O, come, Ventidius,
    You must to Parthia.

 CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA.
 Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,  
    Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

  MESSENGER.

    But, sirrah, mark, we use
    To say the dead are well.
 If Antony
    Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
    To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
    Not like a formal man.

  CLEOPATRA.
' It does allay
    The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
    'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
    Some monstrous malefactor.

  MESSENGER.
 For what good turn?  
  MESSENGER.
 For the best turn i' th' bed.
 Madam, he's married to Octavia.
 Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
    And make thy fortunes proud.

  MESSENGER.

    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
 Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
    The man is innocent.
 Is he married?
    I cannot hate thee worser than I do
    If thou again say 'Yes.
'
  MESSENGER.
 He's married, madam.

  CLEOPATRA.
 The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
  MESSENGER.
 O, I would thou didst,
    So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
    A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
 He is married?
  MESSENGER.
 He is married?
  MESSENGER.
 He's married to Octavia.
 O, that his fault should make a knave of thee  
    That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
 In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.

Near Misenum

Flourish.
 Most meet
    That first we come to words; and therefore have we
    Our written purposes before us sent;
    Which if thou hast considered, let us know
    If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
    That else must perish here.

  CAESAR.
 And what may follow,
    To try a larger fortune.

  ANTONY.
 I have heard it, Pompey,
    And am well studied for a liberal thanks
    Which I do owe you.

  POMPEY.
 Let me have your hand.
 The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
    That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
    For I have gained by't.

  POMPEY.
 I hope so, Lepidus.
 We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
    Draw lots who shall begin.

  ANTONY.
 No, Antony, take the lot;
    But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
    Shall have the fame.

  POMPEY.

  MENAS.
 Y'have said, sir.
 True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
 But you shall find the band that seems
    to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
    their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

  MENAS.
 He
    will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
    the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
    their variance.
 Antony will use his affection where it is; he
    married but his occasion here.
 I shall take it, sir.
 Come, let's away.
 Here they'll be, man.
 [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
      Nile
    By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
    By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
    Or foison follow.

  POMPEY.
 Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
  LEPIDUS.
 Without contradiction I have heard that.

  MENAS.
 What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
  ANTONY.

  LEPIDUS.
 'Tis so.
 And the tears of it are wet.
 [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
      Away!
    Do as I bid you.
 [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad.

  ANTONY.
 These quicksands, Lepidus,
    Keep off them, for you sink.
 Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  POMPEY.
 In me 'tis villainy:
    In thee't had been good service.
 Repent that e'er thy tongue
    Hath so betray'd thine act.

  POMPEY.
 There's a strong fellow, Menas.
 The third part, then, is drunk.

  MENAS.

  POMPEY.
 This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

  ANTONY.
 [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
    And celebrate our drink?
  POMPEY.

            In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
            With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.

  POMPEY.

                              Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
    Menas, I'll not on shore.
 Hoo! says 'a.
 There's my cap.
 Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
    Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
    Make me revenger.
 So thy grand captain, Antony,
    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
    Put garlands on thy head.

  VENTIDIUS.

    Caesar and Antony have ever won
    More in their officer, than person.
 I'll humbly signify what in his name,
    That magical word of war, we have effected;
    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,  
    The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
    We have jaded out o' th' field.
 He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
    The weight we must convey with's will permit,
    We shall appear before him.
- On, there; pass along.
 They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
    The other three are sealing.
 Octavia weeps
    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
    Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
    With the green sickness.
 Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
 Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.

  AGRIPPA.
 But he loves Caesar best.
 [Trumpets
      within] So-
    This is to horse.
 Sister, prove such a wife
    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
    Shall pass on thy approof.

  CAESAR.

    The elements be kind to thee and make
    Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.
 My noble brother!
  ANTONY.
 The April's in her eyes.
 It is love's spring,
    And these the showers to bring it on.
 Be cheerful.

  OCTAVIA.
 [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
  AGRIPPA.
 [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
 Come, sir, come;  
    I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.

              Alexandria.

  CLEOPATRA.

  ALEXAS.
 Is this certain?
  MESSENGER.
 Three in Egypt
    Cannot make better note.

    The fellow has good judgment.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Round even to faultiness.

  CLEOPATRA.
 There's gold for thee.

    I will employ thee back again; I find thee
    Most fit for business.
 A proper man.

  CLEOPATRA.
 The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
                         Exeunt

ACT_3|SC_4
                          SCENE IV.
 Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
    That were excusable, that and thousands more
    Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
    To public ear;
    Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
    He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
    When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
    Or did it from his teeth.

  OCTAVIA.
 Gentle Octavia,
    Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
    Best to preserve it.
 Make your soonest haste;
    So your desires are yours.
 How now, friend Eros!
  EROS.
 Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
    And throw between them all the food thou hast,
    They'll grind the one the other.
 For Italy and Caesar.

  EROS.
 Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
    In Alexandria.
 Unto her
    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
    Absolute queen.

  MAECENAS.
 Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
    His part o' th' isle.

  CAESAR.
 For what I have conquer'd
    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
    And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
    Demand the like.
 Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
 Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
  CAESAR.
 Nay, the dust  
    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
    Rais'd by your populous troops.
 We should have met you
    By sea and land, supplying every stage
    With an augmented greeting.
 Which soon he granted,
    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
 You are abus'd
    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
    To do you justice, make their ministers
    Of us and those that love you.
 Most certain.
 Pray you
    Be ever known to patience.
 Well, is it, is it?
  CLEOPATRA.
 What is't you say?
  ENOBARBUS.
 Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
    That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
    And, as the president of my kingdom, will
    Appear there for a man.


                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS

  ENOBARBUS.

  CLEOPATRA.
 So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
 No disgrace
    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
    Being prepar'd for land.

  ANTONY.
 Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
    Beat th' approaching Caesar.

  ANTONY.
 Well, well- away.
 My lord?
  CAESAR.

                  Another part of the plain

                  Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY.

                 Another part of the plain

        CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way
        over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of
      CAESAR, the other way.
 What's thy passion?
  SCARUS.
 How appears the fight?
  SCARUS.
 That I beheld;
    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
    Endure a further view.
 Had our general
    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.

  SCARUS.
 I'll yet follow
    The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
    Sits in the wind against me.
                          Exeunt

              Alexandria.

    I am so lated in the world that I
    Have lost my way for ever.
 Fly,
    And make your peace with Caesar.
 O Juno!
  ANTONY.

  EROS.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Go to him, madam, speak to him.

    He is unqualitied with very shame.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Well then, sustain me.
 O!
 EROS.
 I have offended reputation-
    A most unnoble swerving.
 Sir, the Queen.
 O my lord, my lord,
    Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
    You would have followed.
 Now I must
    To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
    And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
    With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
    Making and marring fortunes.
 Let him appear that's come from Antony.
 So to them both.

  EUPHRONIUS.
 Bring him through the bands.

  THYREUS.
 Caesar, I shall.
 What shall we do, Enobarbus?
  ENOBARBUS.
 Antony only, that would make his will
    Lord of his reason.
 What though you fled
    From that great face of war, whose several ranges
    Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
    The itch of his affection should not then
    Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
    When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
    The mered question.
 'Twas a shame no less
    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
    And leave his navy gazing.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Prithee, peace.
 He says so.

                                    Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS  
  EUPHRONIUS.


                       Enter a SERVANT

  SERVANT.
 Admit him, sir.
 [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
 None but friends: say boldly.
 So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
 He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
    Or needs not us.
 Go on.
 O!
  THYREUS.
 The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
    Not as deserv'd.
 He is a god, and knows
    What is most right.
                                  Exit
  THYREUS.
 Shall I say to Caesar
    What you require of him? For he partly begs
    To be desir'd to give.
 But it would warm his spirits
    To hear from me you had left Antony,
    And put yourself under his shroud,
    The universal landlord.

  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Give me grace to lay
    My duty on your hand.


                Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY.
 Approach there.
 Take him hence.
 Being whipt,
    Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall
    Bear us an errand to him.
 Good my lord-
  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.
 He did ask favour.

  ANTONY.
 If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him.

    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.
 Alack, our terrene moon
    Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone
    The fall of Antony.
 Not know me yet?
  ANTONY.
 Cold-hearted toward me?
  CLEOPATRA.

  ANTONY.

    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
    If from the field I shall return once more
    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.

  CLEOPATRA.
 That's my brave lord!
  ANTONY.
 I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
    And fight maliciously.
 I will seek
    Some way to leave him.
                                  Exit

ACT_4|SC_1

 Or I will live,
    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
    Shall make it live again.


                Enter three or four servitors
  
    Give me thy hand,
    Thou has been rightly honest.
 Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
 [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
 I look on you
    As one that takes his leave.
 What mean you, sir,
    To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
    And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd.
 Let's to supper, come,
    And drown consideration.
 Nothing.
 Soldiers, have careful watch.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Good night, good night.
 List, list!

  CLEOPATRA.
 Sleep a little.

  CLEOPATRA.

    Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.

    To business that we love we rise betime,
    And go to't with delight.

 Flourish of trumpets within]

                 Enter CAPTAINS and soldiers

  CAPTAIN.

  ANTONY.

    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
 Well said.
 Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
    To make me fight at land!
  SOLDIER.
 Call for Enobarbus,
    He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
    Say 'I am none of thine.

  AGRIPPA.

    Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world
    Shall bear the olive freely.
 Go charge Agrippa
    Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
    That Antony may seem to spend his fury
    Upon himself.
 Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
    Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
    Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
    And leave his master Antony.
 The messenger
    Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
    Unloading of his mules.
 Your emperor
    Continues still a Jove.

    If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
    Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.

             Field of battle between the camps

         Alarum.
 We'll beat'em into bench-holes.

 Let us score their backs
    And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.

    SCARUS.

               Under the walls of Alexandria

        Alarum.
 We have beat him to his camp.
 Leap thou, attire and all,
    Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
    Ride on the pants triumphing.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Throw my heart
    Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
    Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
    And finish all foul thoughts.

  CENTURION.

  SECOND WATCH.
 But he sleeps.

  CENTURION.

  FIRST WATCH.
 Go we to him.
 For both, my lord.

  ANTONY.
 But this it is, our foot
    Upon the hills adjoining to the city
    Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;
    They have put forth the haven-
    Where their appointment we may best discover
    And look on their endeavour.

 Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests.
 All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
 Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee.
 Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all.
 Betray'd I am.

    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
    Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
    Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
 Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph.
 Eros, ho!
    The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
    Subdue my worthiest self.

 Thou hast seen these signs;
    They are black vesper's pageants.


                         Enter MARDIAN

    O, thy vile lady!
    She has robb'd me of my sword.
 No, Antony;
    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
    With thine entirely.
 Death of one person can be paid but once,
    And that she has discharg'd.
 What thou wouldst do  
    Is done unto thy hand.
 She rend'red life,
    Thy name so buried in her.

  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.
 That thou depart'st hence safe
    Does pay thy labour richly.
 So it must be, for now  
    All length is torture.
 Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther.
 Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength.

    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.
- Come, Eros, Eros!

                       Re-enter EROS

  EROS.

    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
 Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
 Turn from me then that noble countenance,
    Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

  ANTONY.
 My sword is drawn.
 Then let it do at once
    The thing why thou hast drawn it.
 My dear master,
    My captain and my emperor, let me say,
    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

  ANTONY.
 Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
 Nor I.
 There, Diomed, there.

  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.
 Too late, good Diomed.
 Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
    To grace it with your sorrows.

  DIOMEDES.

  CLEOPATRA.

    Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
    And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
    Demuring upon me.

  ANTONY.
 Yet come a little.

  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Noblest of men, woo't die?  
    Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
    In this dull world, which in thy absence is
    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
    The crown o' th' earth doth melt.
 My lord!
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
    Are level now with men.
 Lady!
  IRAS.
 No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
    By such poor passion as the maid that milks

    He was my master, and I wore my life
    To spend upon his haters.

 When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
    He needs must see himself.

 So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit
  CAESAR.
 Come hither, Proculeius.
 Go and say
    We purpose her no shame.
 Let him alone, for I remember now
    How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.

                Alexandria.
 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
    A minister of her will; and it is great
    To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
 What's thy name?
  PROCULEIUS.
  
  CLEOPATRA.
 If your master
    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
    That majesty, to keep decorum, must
    No less beg than a kingdom.

  IRAS.
 Let the world see
    His nobleness well acted, which your death
    Will never let come forth.

  CLEOPATRA.
 O, temperance, lady!
  CLEOPATRA.
 Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
    If idle talk will once be necessary,
    I'll not sleep neither.
 For the Queen,
    I'll take her to my guard.

    You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
    Is't not your trick?

 Most sovereign creature-

 Gentle madam, no.
 You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.

  CLEOPATRA.

  CAESAR.
 Where's Seleucus?
  SELEUCUS.
 Here, madam.
 [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;
    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
    Through th' ashes of my chance.
 Still be't yours,
    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
    Of things that merchants sold.
 Not so.

    I have spoke already, and it is provided;
    Go put it to the haste.

  CHARMIAN.
 Madam, I will.
 Behold, sir.
 Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
    Which my love makes religion to obey,
    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
    Intends his journey, and within three days
    You with your children will he send before.

    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
    Your pleasure and my promise.
 Mechanic slaves,
    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
    And forc'd to drink their vapour.
 Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras.
 O the good gods!
  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Bring our crown and all.
 A noise within
    Wherefore's this noise?

  GUARDSMAN.

    My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
    Of woman in me.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
  CLOWN.
 Farewell.
 Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
 Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
    the feeding.
 I know that a woman is a dish for
    the gods, if the devil dress her not.
 But truly, these same
    whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
    every ten that they make the devils mar five.

  CLOWN.
 Husband, I come.
 IRAS falls and dies]
    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
    If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
    The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
    Which hurts and is desir'd.

  CHARMIAN.
 Come, thou mortal wretch,
                    [To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
    With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
    Of life at once untie.
 O, break! O, break!

 Too slow a messenger.
 What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
  CHARMIAN.

 Poison'd then.

 Our army shall
    In solemn show attend this funeral,
    And then to Rome.

  ORLANDO.
 Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
    up.
 Now, sir! what make you here?
  ORLANDO.
 Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
 Know you where you are, sir?
  ORLANDO.

  OLIVER.
 I know you are
    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
    should so know me.
 The courtesy of nations allows you my better
    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us.
 I have as
    much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
    before me is nearer to his reverence.

  OLIVER.
 What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
  ORLANDO.
 Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

  ADAM.
 Let me go, I say.
 And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
    get you in.
 I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
 Get you with him, you old dog.

 not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
  DENNIS.
 [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
    to-morrow the wrestling is.


                          Enter CHARLES

  CHARLES.

  OLIVER.
 What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
  CHARLES.
 Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    matter.

    Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
    in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,  
    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.

    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
    neck as his finger.
 Farewell, good Charles.
 But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
    shall clear all.
 I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
 Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
    would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
    extraordinary pleasure.
 Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.

  ROSALIND.

    Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.
 Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
    Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
 Were you made the messenger?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 Where learned you that oath, fool?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

  CELIA.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
    men do foolishly.
 Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.

  CELIA.
 Bon jour,
    Monsieur Le Beau.
 What's the news?
  LE BEAU.
 Thou losest thy old smell.
 I would have told you of good
    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
 Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

  LE BEAU.
 I could match this beginning with an old tale.

  ROSALIND.
 The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.
 Alas!
  TOUCHSTONE.
 But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
    lost?
  LE BEAU.
 It is the first time
    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
 But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
    his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we
    see this wrestling, cousin?
  LE BEAU.

  CELIA.

  FREDERICK.
 Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.

  ORLANDO.
 I attend them with all respect and duty.

  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
  
  ORLANDO.
 But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
    willing to be so.
 Fare you well.
 Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
    lie with his mother earth?
  ORLANDO.
 I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
    leg.
 O excellent young man!
  CELIA.
 Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
 Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
    Boys.

    Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,  
    Hadst thou descended from another house.

                                 Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
  CELIA.

  CELIA.
 Sir, you have well deserv'd;
    If you do keep your promises in love
    But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
    Your mistress shall be happy.
  
  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
 Have with you.
 What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
    I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
 Sir, fare you well.

                                                    Exit LE BEAU
    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.

  CELIA.
 I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
    heart.

  CELIA.
 Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
  ROSALIND.
 No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
 Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
    do.

  CELIA.
 Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
    And get you from our court.
 You, cousin.

    Within these ten days if that thou beest found
    So near our public court as twenty miles,
    Thou diest for it.
 Thus do all traitors;
    If their purgation did consist in words,
    They are as innocent as grace itself.

    Treason is not inherited, my lord;
    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
    What's that to me? My father was no traitor.

  CELIA.
 Thou hast not, cousin.
 Were it not better,  
    Because that I am more than common tall,
    That I did suit me all points like a man?
    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
    As many other mannish cowards have
    That do outface it with their semblances.

  CELIA.
 But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
    The clownish fool out of your father's court?
    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

ACT II.

    I would not change it.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 O, yes, into a thousand similes.
 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
    'Tis just the fashion.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 And did you leave him in this contemplation?
  SECOND LORD.
 We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
    Upon the sobbing deer.
 Show me the place;
    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
    For then he's full of matter.

    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
    Saw her abed, and in the morning early
    They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.

  SECOND LORD.
 My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
    Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.

    Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
    Your daughter and her cousin much commend
    The parts and graces of the wrestler
    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
    And she believes, wherever they are gone,
    That youth is surely in their company.
 Do this suddenly;
    And let not search and inquisition quail
    To bring again these foolish runaways.

    Know you not, master, to some kind of men
    Their graces serve them but as enemies?
    No more do yours.
 Your virtues, gentle master,
    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.

    Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
    Yet not the son; I will not call him son
    Of him I was about to call his father-
    Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
    And you within it.
 If he fail of that,
    He will have other means to cut you off;
    I overheard him and his practices.
 I have five hundred crowns,
    The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
    When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
    And unregarded age in corners thrown.
 Let me go with you;
    I'll do the service of a younger man
    In all your business and necessities.
 I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  SILVIUS.

    But if thy love were ever like to mine,
    As sure I think did never man love so,
    How many actions most ridiculous
    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
  CORIN.

    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
  ROSALIND.
 And I mine.
 Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
    my shins against it.
 Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
    Is much upon my fashion.
  
  TOUCHSTONE.

  CELIA.
 I pray you, one of you question yond man
    If he for gold will give us any food;
    I faint almost to death.

  CORIN.

  CORIN.
 Else are they very wretched.

  CORIN.

    Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
    And faints for succour.
 That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
    That little cares for buying any thing.
 I like this place,
    And willingly could waste my time in it.

    Go with me; if you like upon report
    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,  
    I will your very faithful feeder be,
    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

  AMIENS.
 I thank it.

  AMIENS.
 Call you 'em stanzos?  
  AMIENS.
 Come, sing; and you
    that will not, hold your tongues.
 Well, I'll end the song.
 Come, warble,
    come.


  JAQUES.
 Thus it goes:

             If it do come to pass
             That any man turn ass,
             Leaving his wealth and ease
             A stubborn will to please,
           Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
             Here shall he see  
             Gross fools as he,
             An if he will come to me.
 What's that 'ducdame'?
  JAQUES.

The forest

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

  ADAM.
 Farewell, kind master.
 If this uncouth
    forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
    bring it for food to thee.
 Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
    powers.
 For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
    arm's end.
 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws

  DUKE SENIOR.
 My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

  DUKE SENIOR.

  DUKE SENIOR.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 O that I were a fool!
    I am ambitious for a motley coat.
 It is my only suit,
    Provided that you weed your better judgments
    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
    That I am wise.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
 Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
    I thought that all things had been savage here,
    And therefore put I on the countenance
    Of stern commandment.
 Then but forbear your food a little while,
    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
    And give it food.
 I thank you most for him.
 So had you need;
    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.


            Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
            That dost not bite so nigh
              As benefits forgot;
            Though thou the waters warp,
            Thy sting is not so sharp
              As friend rememb'red not.
 Good old man,
    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
 Well, push him out of doors;
    And let my officers of such a nature
    Make an extent upon his house and lands.
 As it is a spare life,
    look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
    in it, it goes much against my stomach.
 No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
    or comes of a very dull kindred.
 Then thou art damn'd.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 For not being at court? Your reason.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
    know, are greasy.
 Shallow again.
 And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our  
    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
    perfum'd with civet.

  CORIN.
 If thou beest not damn'd for this,
    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
    thou shouldst scape.
 It is the right
    butter-women's rank to market.
 Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
 Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for
    you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right
    virtue of the medlar.

           Some, how brief the life of man
             Runs his erring pilgrimage,
           That the streching of a span
             Buckles in his sum of age;
           Some, of violated vows
             'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
           But upon the fairest boughs,
             Or at every sentence end,
           Will I Rosalinda write,
             Teaching all that read to know
           The quintessence of every sprite
             Heaven would in little show.

             Nature presently distill'd
           Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
             Cleopatra's majesty,
           Atalanta's better part,
             Sad Lucretia's modesty.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;  
    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
 But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
    hang'd and carved upon these trees?
  ROSALIND.
 I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
    came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree.
 Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND.

    Change you colour?
  ROSALIND.
 Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
    me who it is.

  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.
 Nay, he hath but a little beard.
 It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
    and your heart both in an instant.

  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.

  CELIA.
 There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.

  CELIA.
 Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
    unseasonably.
 Soft! comes he not here?

                   Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES  

  ROSALIND.

  ORLANDO.
 I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
    ill-favouredly.

  JAQUES.
 Just as high as my heart.
 You are full of pretty answers.

  ORLANDO.

  JAQUES.

  JAQUES.
 I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.

  ORLANDO.
 I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO.

  ROSALIND.

  ORLANDO.
 With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.

  ORLANDO.
 Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
    believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
    she does.
 Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too.
 Yet I profess curing
    it by counsel.

  ORLANDO.
 Tell me where it is.

  ROSALIND.
 Come, sister, will you
    go?                                                   Exeunt




SCENE III.
 I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
 [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
    thatch'd house!
  TOUCHSTONE.

    Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.

  AUDREY.

  JAQUES.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
    sluttishness may come hereafter.
 Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting.
 Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
    deer hath them as huge as the rascal.


                       Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.
 Will you dispatch us here
    under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
  MARTEXT.
 Is there none here to give the woman?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
    hereafter to leave my wife.
 Not-
               O sweet Oliver,
               O brave Oliver,
           Leave me not behind thee.
 Never talk to me; I will weep.
 I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
 He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana.
 Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

  CELIA.
 I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.

  ROSALIND.
 O, come, let us remove!
    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
 I would not be thy executioner;
    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
 But till that time
    Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,  
    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
    As till that time I shall not pity thee.
 [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
      mother,
    That you insult, exult, and all at once,
    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
    As, by my faith, I see no more in you
    Than without candle may go dark to bed-
    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
    I see no more in you than in the ordinary
    Of nature's sale-work.

  PHEBE.
 Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not proud; though all the world could see,
    None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
 Sweet Phebe.
 Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

  SILVIUS.
 Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.

    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
    By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
    Were both extermin'd.
 Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS.
  
  PHEBE.

    But do not look for further recompense
    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

  PHEBE.
 Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.

    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
    In parcels as I did, would have gone near
    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
    For what had he to do to chide at me?
    He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,  
    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
 Phebe, with all my heart.
 I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
    thee.

  JAQUES.
 Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
    drunkards.

  JAQUES.

  JAQUES.
 I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
    emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
    courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
    ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
    which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
    from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous  
    sadness.

  ORLANDO.
 My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.

  ROSALIND.

  ORLANDO.
 Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.

  ORLANDO.
 Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND.
 Troilus had
    his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
 I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
    protest, her frown might kill me.
 Ay, and twenty such.

  ORLANDO.
 What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND.
 I hope so.
 Give me your hand,
    Orlando.
 I cannot say the words.
 Go to.
'
  ORLANDO.
 I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

  ROSALIND.
 Say 'a day' without the 'ever.
 I will weep for
    nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
    are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
    thou are inclin'd to sleep.
 But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND.
 By my life, she will do as I do.

  ROSALIND.
 Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.

  ORLANDO.

  ROSALIND.
 'Tis but one cast away, and  
    so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  ORLANDO.
 By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
    of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
    think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
    lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
    be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.

  ROSALIND.
 Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try.
 Adieu.
 You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate.
 We must
    have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
    world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
 I'll tell thee,
    Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.
                                  Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
  LORD.


                    SONG.


      What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
      His leather skin and horns to wear.

                              [The rest shall hear this burden:]
           Then sing him home.


      Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;  
      It was a crest ere thou wast born.

The forest

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

  ROSALIND.
 I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
    ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep.

  ROSALIND.

    She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;  
    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
    Were man as rare as Phoenix.

  SILVIUS.

    I say she never did invent this letter:
    This is a man's invention, and his hand.

  ROSALIND.
 Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
    A style for challengers.
 Will you hear the letter?
  SILVIUS.

  ROSALIND.

                                                         [Reads]

            'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
            That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'

    Can a woman rail thus?
  SILVIUS.
'
  
    Meaning me a beast.


            'If the scorn of your bright eyne
            Have power to raise such love in mine,
            Alack, in me what strange effect
            Would they work in mild aspect!
            Whiles you chid me, I did love;
            How then might your prayers move!
            He that brings this love to the
            Little knows this love in me;
            And by him seal up thy mind,
            Whether that thy youth and kind
            Will the faithful offer take
            Of me and all that I can make;
            Or else by him my love deny,
            And then I'll study how to die.
 Wilt thou love
    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false  
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her.
 Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
    A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
  CELIA.

    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.

  OLIVER.
 It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

  OLIVER.
 Orlando doth commend him to you both;
    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
    He sends this bloody napkin.
 Some of my shame; if you will know of me
    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
    This handkercher was stain'd.

  OLIVER.

    This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

  OLIVER.
 Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER.
 I do not shame
    To tell you what I was, since my conversion
    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

  ROSALIND.
 We'll lead you thither.
 I do so, I confess it.
 Heigh-ho!
  OLIVER.
 This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
 So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
    right.

    Good sir, go with us.

  OLIVER.

  ROSALIND.
 I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
    counterfeiting to him.
 Will you go?                   Exeunt

    But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
    you.

  AUDREY.


                         Enter WILLIAM

  TOUCHSTONE.
 By my troth,
    we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
    flouting; we cannot hold.
  
  TOUCHSTONE.
 A ripe age.
 I do now remember a saying: 'The
    fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
    a fool.
  
  TOUCHSTONE.
 Give me your hand.
 Art thou learned?
  WILLIAM.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
    figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
    glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
    writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
    am he.
 Therefore, you
    clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which
    in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
    woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
    death, thy liberty into bondage.
 God rest you merry, sir.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
    like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
    and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
    her?
  OLIVER.
 You have my consent.
 Let your wedding be to-morrow.

    Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers.
 God save you, brother.
 It is my arm.

  ROSALIND.
 Nay, 'tis true.
 Clubs cannot part them.

  ORLANDO.

  ROSALIND.
 Know
    of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
    a gentleman of good conceit.

  ORLANDO.

  ROSALIND.

  PHEBE.
 And I for Rosalind.

  ORLANDO.

  ROSALIND.
 And so am I for no woman.

  ROSALIND.
 So, fare you well; I have left you
    commands.

The forest

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

  TOUCHSTONE.
 I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
    dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 By my troth, well met.

        It was a lover and his lass,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        That o'er the green corn-field did pass
          In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.


        Between the acres of the rye,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        These pretty country folks would lie,
          In the spring time, &c.


  TOUCHSTONE.
 YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
    time.
 God buy you; and God mend your voices.
 Come,
    Audrey.
 That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
 That will I, should I die the hour after.
 So is the bargain.

  ROSALIND.

                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
  DUKE SENIOR.
 There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
    coming to the ark.
 He hath been a
     courtier, he swears.

    I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
    politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
    three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
    one.

  DUKE SENIOR.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
    the seventh cause?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 I did dislike the cut of a certain
    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was.
 This is call'd the Retort
    Courteous.
 This
    is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome.
 And so to the Lie
    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
 I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
    and parted.

  JAQUES.
  
  ORLANDO.
 I'll have no father, if you be not he;
    I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
    Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

            You and you no cross shall part;
            You and you are heart in heart;
            You to his love must accord,
            Or have a woman to your lord;
            You and you are sure together,
            As the winter to foul weather.
 Let me have audience for a word or two.

    I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,  
    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
 Welcome, young man.

    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
    And fall into our rustic revelry.
 He hath.

  JAQUES.
               Exit
  DUKE SENIOR.
 We will begin these rites,
    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

EPILOGUE
                           EPILOGUE.
 What a
    case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
    insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
    furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me.

 Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
  And by the doom of death end woes and all.
 Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
  My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

  The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
  Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
  And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.

  At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
  And, by the benefit of his wished light,
  The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
  Two ships from far making amain to us-
  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
 O, had the gods done so, I had not now
  Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
  For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
  We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  Which being violently borne upon,
  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  What to delight in, what to sorrow for.

  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
  That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
 And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
  Do me the favour to dilate at full
  What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
 My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
  At eighteen years became inquisitive
  After his brother, and importun'd me
  That his attendant-so his case was like,
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
  Might bear him company in the quest of him;
  Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
  I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
 I will, my lord.

  There is your money that I had to keep.
 Farewell till then.

FIRST MERCHANT.

<Exit FIRST MERCHANT
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

  So I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.


Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

  Here comes the almanac of my true date.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
  Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.

  Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
  Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
  But not a thousand marks between you both.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands!
  Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
, AND IS
PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF ILLINOIS BENEDICTINE COLLEGE
WITH PERMISSION.
 Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
  That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
 But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA.
 How if your husband start some other where?
LUCIANA.

  So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
  But if thou live to see like right bereft,
  This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
 Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
 Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 I mean not cuckold-mad;
  But, sure, he is stark mad.

  'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.
'
  So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
  For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA.
 Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

<Exit
LUCIANA.
 His company must do his minions grace,
  Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.

  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  That's not my fault; he's master of my state.

  What ruins are in me that can be found
  By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of my defeatures.
 Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 I did not see you since you sent me hence,
  Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

[Beating him]
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  Upon what bargain do you give it me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Thank me, sir! for what?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Basting.
 By what rule, sir?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 There's no time for a man to recover
  his hair that grows bald by nature.
 May he not do it by fine and recovery?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Why, but there's many a man
  hath more hair than wit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
  and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

  How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
  Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
  And that this body, consecrate to thee,
  By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
  And hurl the name of husband in my face,
  And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
  And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
  And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
  I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.

  Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
  I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.
 By me?
ADRIANA.
 Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
  What is the course and drift of your compact?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
 Dromio, play the porter well.
 Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
 Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
 SCENE 1

Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
 I think thou art an ass.
 Marry, so it doth appear
  By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
 I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
 And welcome more common; for that's nothing
  but words.

  But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
  Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
  [Within]  The porter for this time,
    sir, and my name is Dromio.
 O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
    office and my name!
  The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
 Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE.
  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
  And so tell your master.
  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

LUCE.
 Master, knock the door hard.
  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

Enter ADRIANA, within

ADRIANA.
  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Are you there, wife? You might
    have come before.
 If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

BALTHAZAR.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
  For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
  If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.

BALTHAZAR.
 Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
  Herein you war against your reputation,
  And draw within the compass of suspect
  Th' unviolated honour of your wife.

  Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
  Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  Why at this time the doors are made against you.

  Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
  And, about evening, come yourself alone
  To know the reason of this strange restraint.

  Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
  I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

  'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

  Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
  To make it wander in an unknown field?
  Are you a god? Would you create me new?
  Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.

  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.

  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.

LUCIANA.
 It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

LUCIANA.

LUCIANA.
 All this my sister is, or else should be.
 Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
  Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
  Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
  making war against her heir.
 O, Sir, I did not look so low.
 Go hie thee presently post to the road;
  An if the wind blow any way from shore,
  I will not harbour in this town to-night.

  She that doth call me husband, even my soul
  Doth for a wife abhor.
 Lo, here is the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.

ANGELO.
 You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.

  I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
  If any ship put out, then straight away.

ACT IV.
 Even just the sum that I do owe to you
  Is growing to me by Antipholus;
  And in the instant that I met with you
  He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  I shall receive the money for the same.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S

OFFICER.
 That labour may you save; see where he comes.

<Exit DROMIO
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
  I promised your presence and the chain;
  But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.

  Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
  And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
 Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
  Or else you may return without your money.

SECOND MERCHANT.

  Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
  If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 I owe you none till I receive the chain.
 You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.

  Either consent to pay this sum for me,
  Or I attach you by this officer.
 I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
  And told thee to what purpose and what end.
 I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
  And teach your ears to list me with more heed.

  To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
  That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
  There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
 To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
  Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.

  She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.

ADRIANA.
 Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
 That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

ADRIANA.

ADRIANA.

  A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
  One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
  A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
  A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
  A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
  The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
  A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
  One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.

ADRIANA.
 If any hour meet a sergeant,
    'a turns back for very fear.

ADRIANA.

  Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit-
  Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
 No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that
  went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
  that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
  them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
  them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
  exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
 What, thou mean'st an officer?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

Enter a COURTEZAN

COURTEZAN.

  Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
 Master, is this Mistress Satan?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
  The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
 'Fly pride' says the peacock.

<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
COURTEZAN.
 Fear me not, man; I will not break away.


Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end

  Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
 Good now, hold thy tongue.
 Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
 I would I were senseless, sir, that I
  might not feel your blows.
 I am
  wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
  out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
  with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
  beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
  I shall beg with it from door to door.


Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER
call'd PINCH

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
  rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.
 His incivility confirms no less.
 Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

[Striking him]
PINCH.

ADRIANA.
 Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
PINCH.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
 Wilt thou suffer them
  To make a rescue?
OFFICER.

[They bind DROMIO]
ADRIANA.

ADRIANA.
 One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
ADRIANA.
 I know the man.
 And come with naked swords.

  Let's call more help to have them bound again.

  I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 I will not stay to-night for all the town;
  Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

ACT V.
 SCENE 1

A street before a priory

Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO

ANGELO.
 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
  Which he forswore most monstrously to have.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

  Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
  To walk where any honest men resort.
 Wherefore throng you hither?
ADRIANA.
 To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
 How long hath this possession held the man?
ADRIANA.

ABBESS.

  Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
ADRIANA.

ADRIANA.
 Ay, but not rough enough.
 And in assemblies too.

  Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
  Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
  Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
  And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
  Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
 She did betray me to my own reproof.

  Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.

ABBESS.
 Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
 Upon what cause?
SECOND MERCHANT.

ANGELO.
 Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.

ADRIANA.

  My master preaches patience to him, and the while
  His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
  And sure, unless you send some present help,
  Between them they will kill the conjurer.

ADRIANA.
 Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
  I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.

[Cry within]
  Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!
DUKE.
 Come, stand by me; fear nothing.
 Guard with halberds.

DUKE.
 Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
 No, my good lord.
 My liege, I am advised what I say;
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
  Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.

  Then fairly I bespoke the officer
  To go in person with me to my house.

ANGELO.
 But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
ANGELO.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

  You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
  Denies that saying.
 Sirrah, what say you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.
 O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
  And careful hours with time's deformed hand
  Have written strange defeatures in my face.
 I never saw my father in my life.
 I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

  If thou art she, tell me where is that son
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
ABBESS.

DUKE.
 Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
 I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 And so do I, yet did she call me so;
  And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
  Did call me brother.

  I see we still did meet each other's man,
  And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
  And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 These ducats pawn I for my father here.
 It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
 There, take it; and much thanks for my
  good cheer.

  The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
  And you the calendars of their nativity,
  Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
  After so long grief, such nativity!
DUKE.

 Nay, then, thus:

  And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

 SCENE I.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 One word, good citizens.
 We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
 Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
    rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
    thirst for revenge.

  SECOND CITIZEN.
 Nay, but speak not maliciously.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 You must in no way say he is covetous.
 He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!
  MENENIUS.
 What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
    With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
 They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
    they shall know we have strong arms too.
 For your wants,
    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
    Against the Roman state; whose course will on
    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
    Of more strong link asunder than can ever
    Appear in your impediment.
  
  MENENIUS.
 I shall tell you
    A pretty tale.
 Note me this, good friend:
    Your most grave belly was deliberate,
    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
 But, if you do remember,
    I send it through the rivers of your blood,
    Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
    And, through the cranks and offices of man,
    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
    From me receive that natural competency
    Whereby they live.
 Ay, sir; well, well.
  
  MENENIUS.
 How apply you this?
  MENENIUS.


                      Enter CAIUS MARCIUS

    Hail, noble Marcius!
  MARCIUS.
 What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
    Make yourselves scabs?
  FIRST CITIZEN.
 What would you have, you curs,
    That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
    The other makes you proud.
 He that trusts to you,
    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
    Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
    Or hailstone in the sun.
 Hang ye! Trust ye?
    With every minute you do change a mind
    And call him noble that was now your hate,
    Him vile that was your garland.
 What's the matter
    That in these several places of the city
    You cry against the noble Senate, who,
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
  MENENIUS.
 Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
    For though abundantly they lack discretion,
    Yet are they passing cowardly.
 Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
    Of their own choice.

  MARCIUS.
 Where's Caius Marcius?
  MARCIUS.
 I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
    Our musty superfluity.

  MARCIUS.
 They have a leader,
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
 He is a lion
    That I am proud to hunt.
  [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
 Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
  SICINIUS.

  BRUTUS.

    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
    To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
    In aught he merit not.

  BRUTUS.

  AUFIDIUS.
 The dearth is great;
    The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
    And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
    These three lead on this preparation
    Whither 'tis bent.

  AUFIDIUS.
 I leave your honours.

Rome.
 I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
    comfortable sort.


                        Enter a GENTLEWOMAN

  GENTLEWOMAN.
 The breasts of Hecuba,
    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
    Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
    At Grecian sword, contemning.
 Sweet madam!
  VIRGILIA.

  VALERIA.
 O, I warrant, how he
    mammock'd it!
  VOLUMNIA.
 A crack, madam.

  VALERIA.
 Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
    idle huswife with me this afternoon.
 Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you  
    must go visit the good lady that lies in.

  VOLUMNIA.
 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
 Thus it
    is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
    general is gone, with one part of our Roman power.
                           Exeunt




SCENE IV.

  LARTIUS.
 No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
    For half a hundred years.
 Summon the town.
 Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.

    Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight  
    With hearts more proof than shields.
 Come on, my fellows.

                      Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing

  MARCIUS.
 The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
                          them to the gates

    So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
    'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
    Not for the fliers.
 See, they have shut him in.
             [Alarum continues]

                      Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS

  LARTIUS.
 What is become of Marcius?  
  ALL.
 Following the fliers at the very heels,
    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
    Clapp'd to their gates.
 O noble fellow!
    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
    And when it bows stand'st up.


          Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy

  FIRST SOLDIER.

Within Corioli.
 This will I carry to Rome.

  SECOND ROMAN.
 And I this.
 Down with them!
                                                Exeunt pillagers
    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
    Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
    Convenient numbers to make good the city;  
    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
    To help Cominius.
 Thy friend no less
    Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

Near the camp of COMINIUS

Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers

  COMINIUS.
 Well fought; we are come off
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
    Nor cowardly in retire.
 Whiles we have struck,
    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
    The charges of our friends.
 The Roman gods,
    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
    That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
    May give you thankful sacrifice!

                         Enter A MESSENGER

    Thy news?
  MESSENGER.

  COMINIUS.
 The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
    More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue  
    From every meaner man.

  MARCIUS.
 Come I too late?
  COMINIUS.
 O! let me clip ye
    In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
    As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
    And tapers burn'd to bedward.
 But how prevail'd you?
  MARCIUS.
 Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
 How lies their battle? Know you on which side
    They have plac'd their men of trust?
  COMINIUS.

  COMINIUS.
 Those are they
    That most are willing.
 A certain number,
    Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
    Shall bear the business in some other fight,
    As cause will be obey'd.
 Please you to march;
    And four shall quickly draw out my command,
    Which men are best inclin'd.
 So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
    As I have set them down.
 I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
    Worse than a promise-breaker.

  AUFIDIUS.
 We hate alike:
    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
    More than thy fame and envy.
 If I fly, Marcius,
    Halloa me like a hare.

  MARCIUS.
 'Tis not my blood
    Wherein thou seest me mask'd.
 For thy revenge
    Wrench up thy power to th' highest.

  AUFIDIUS.
 Wert thou the Hector
    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,  
    Thou shouldst not scape me here.
 MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
                             breathless

    Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
    In your condemned seconds.
 Enter, at one door,
COMINIUS with the Romans; at another door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf

  COMINIUS.
 O General,  
    Here is the steed, we the caparison.
 Pray now, no more; my mother,
    Who has a charter to extol her blood,
    When she does praise me grieves me.

    He that has but effected his good will
    Hath overta'en mine act.
 Of all the horses-
    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
    The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
    Before the common distribution at
    Your only choice.

  MARCIUS.
 I do refuse it,
    And stand upon my common part with those
    That have beheld the doing.
 No more, I say.
 Too modest are you;
    More cruel to your good report than grateful
    To us that give you truly.
 By your patience,
    If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
    Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
    Then reason safely with you.
 So, to our tent;
    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
    To Rome of our success.
 I shall, my lord.
 I sometime lay here in Corioli
    At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.

  COMINIUS.

    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
    It should be look'd to.
                         Exeunt




SCENE X.
, AND IS
PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF ILLINOIS BENEDICTINE COLLEGE
WITH PERMISSION.
 Pray you, who does the wolf love?
  SICINIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
 He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb.

  MENENIUS.
 This is strange now.

  MENENIUS.
 I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
    many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
    abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone.
 What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.

  MENENIUS.
 Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee.
 And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he
    had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
    chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them.
 Good ladies, let's go.
 In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
 True! I'll be sworn they are true.
 Where is he wounded?
  VOLUMNIA.
 Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave.


            A sennet.
 Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
  CORIOLANUS.
 No more of this, it does offend my heart.
 O,
    You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
    For my prosperity!                                  [Kneels]
  VOLUMNIA.
 Nay, my good soldier, up;
    My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
    By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-
    What is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?
    But, O, thy wife!
  CORIOLANUS.
 I could weep  
    And I could laugh; I am light and heavy.

    We call a nettle but a nettle, and
    The faults of fools but folly.
 Menenius ever, ever.

  COMINIUS.
 It was his word.
 'Tis most like he will.
 What's the matter?
  MESSENGER.
 Let's to the Capitol,
    And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
    But hearts for the event.
 Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
    Coriolanus will carry it.
 If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
    he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;  
    but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
    render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
    him their opposite.
 Now to seem to affect the malice and
    displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
    flatter them for their love.
 No more of him; he's a worthy man.
 Make way, they
    are coming.
 SICINIUS and  
               BRUTUS take their places by themselves.
 Therefore please you,
    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
    The present consul and last general
    In our well-found successes to report
    A little of that worthy work perform'd
    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
    We met here both to thank and to remember
    With honours like himself.

  SICINIUS.

  MENENIUS.
 That's off, that's off;
    I would you rather had been silent.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
    Should not be utter'd feebly.
 It is held
    That valour is the chiefest virtue and
    Most dignifies the haver.
 For this last,
    Before and in Corioli, let me say
    I cannot speak him home.
 He stopp'd the fliers,
    And by his rare example made the coward
    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
    And fell below his stem.

    When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
    His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
    Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
    And to the battle came he; where he did
    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
    'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
    Both field and city ours he never stood
    To ease his breast with panting.

  MENENIUS.
 Our spoils he kick'd at,
    And look'd upon things precious as they were
    The common muck of the world.
 I do owe them still
    My life and services.

  MENENIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
    Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,
    As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
    Of their breath only!
  MENENIUS.
 To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
                             [Flourish.

  BRUTUS.
 On th' market-place
    I know they do attend us.
 The Forum

Enter seven or eight citizens

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 And to make us no better thought of, a little help
    will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
    not to call us the many-headed multitude.
 Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
    fly?
  THIRD CITIZEN.
 Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
    will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
    liberty 'twould sure southward.
 Why that way?
  THIRD CITIZEN.
 Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
    no matter, the greater part carries it.


                Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,
                               with MENENIUS  

    Here he comes, and in the gown of humility.
 He's to make his
    requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
    honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
    therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.
 Think upon me? Hang 'em!  
    I would they would forget me, like the virtues
    Which our divines lose by 'em.

  MENENIUS.
 You'll mar all.
                                    Exit

                       Re-enter three of the citizens

  CORIOLANUS.
 Bid them wash their faces
    And keep their teeth clean.

  SECOND CITIZEN.
 No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
    with begging.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't.
 I have wounds to show
    you, which shall be yours in private.
 You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
 A match, sir.

    I have your alms.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Therefore, beseech you I
    may be consul.

  FIFTH CITIZEN.
 I
    will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.

    What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
    For truth to o'erpeer.
 Therefore let him be consul.
 The gods give him
    joy, and make him good friend to the people!
  ALL.
 Amen, amen.

  CORIOLANUS.
 There, Coriolanus.
 I'll keep you company.
 How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
  FIRST CITIZEN.

  BRUTUS.
 Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
    He us'd us scornfully.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 Now you have left your voices,
    I have no further with you.
' Was not this mockery?
  SICINIUS.

  SECOND CITIZENS.

  BRUTUS.

  SICINIUS.
 Let them assemble;
    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
    Your ignorant election.
 Say you chose him
    More after our commandment than as guided
    By your own true affections; and that your minds,
    Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
    Than what you should, made you against the grain
    To voice him consul.
 Ay, spare us not.
                   Exeunt plebeians
  BRUTUS.
 Let them go on;
    This mutiny were better put in hazard
    Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
 SCENE I.
 They are worn, Lord Consul, so
    That we shall hardly in our ages see
    Their banners wave again.
 Spoke he of me?
  LARTIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 At Antium lives he?
  LARTIUS.
 At Antium.


                       Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

    Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
    The tongues o' th' common mouth.

  SICINIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Not unlike
    Each way to better yours.
 Let's be calm.
 Tell me of corn!
    This was my speech, and I will speak't again-
  MENENIUS.
 No more words, we beseech you.

  BRUTUS.

  SICINIUS.
 'Twere well
    We let the people know't.

  MENENIUS.
 Choler!
    Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
    By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
  SICINIUS.
 Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
    The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
    Sometime in Greece-
  MENENIUS.
 Well, well, no more of that.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
    I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
    The ruin of the state.
' Thus we debase
    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
    Call our cares fears; which will in time
    Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
    The crows to peck the eagles.
 Enough, with over measure.
 No, take more.
 Manifest treason!
  SICINIUS.
 Help, ye citizens!

              Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES

  MENENIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Seize him, aediles.
 Down with him! down with him!
  SECOND SENATOR.
 Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!
  MENENIUS.
 You are at point to lose your liberties.

    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
    Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
 To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
 And so are like to do.
 This deserves death.

  BRUTUS.
 We do here pronounce,
    Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
    We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
    Of present death.

  SICINIUS.

  PLEBEIANS.
 No: I'll die here.
 Help Marcius, help,
    You that be noble; help him, young and old.
 Get you gone.
 The gods forbid!
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
    Leave us to cure this cause.

  MENENIUS.
 For 'tis a sore upon us
    You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.

  MENENIUS.
 Be gone.

    Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
    One time will owe another.
 Pray you be gone.

                     Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others
  PATRICIANS.
 I would they were a-bed.
 You worthy Tribunes-
  SICINIUS.
 He shall well know
    The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
    And we their hands.
 Sir, how comes't that you
    Have holp to make this rescue?
  MENENIUS.
 The consul Coriolanus.

  SICINIUS.

    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
    Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
    Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
    By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
    And what is left, to lose it by his country
    Were to us all that do't and suffer it
    A brand to th' end o' th' world.

  SICINIUS.

    Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
    Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
    Spread further.

  MENENIUS.
 One word more, one word
    This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
    Tie leaden pounds to's heels.
 Go not home.

  SICINIUS.

    [To the SENATORS]  Let me desire your company; he must come,
    Or what is worst will follow.

  FIRST SENATOR.
                   Exeunt




SCENE II.

  CORIOLANUS.

  VOLUMNIA.
 Ay, and burn too.

  MENENIUS.
 Well said, noble woman!
    Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that
    The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic
    For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
    Which I can scarcely bear.
 What must I do?
  MENENIUS.
 Well, what then, what then?
  MENENIUS.
 If it be honour in your wars to seem
    The same you are not, which for your best ends
    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
    That it shall hold companionship in peace
    With honour as in war; since that to both
    It stands in like request?
  CORIOLANUS.
 Noble lady!
    Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so,
    Not what is dangerous present, but the los
    Of what is past.
 I prithee now, My son,
    Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;
    And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
    Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines  
    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
    More learned than the ears- waving thy head,
    Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry
    That will not hold the handling.

    Here is Cominius.
 To th' market-place!
    You have put me now to such a part which never
    I shall discharge to th' life.

  COMINIUS.
 Come, come, we'll prompt you.

SCENE III.
 With old Menenius, and those senators
    That always favour'd him.

  BRUTUS.
 Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,

 Amen, amen!

  CORIOLANUS.

  MENENIUS.
 What is the matter,
    That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
    I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
    You take it off again?
  SICINIUS.

  SICINIUS.
 We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
    From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
    Yourself into a power tyrannical;
    For which you are a traitor to the people.

  SICINIUS.
 Peace!
    We need not put new matter to his charge.

  BRUTUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Hear me, my masters and my common friends-
  SICINIUS.
 He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.

  COMINIUS.
 There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
    As enemy to the people and his country.
  PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANY
SERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.

Rome.
 You were us'd to load me
    With precepts that would make invincible
    The heart that conn'd them.
 Farewell, my wife, my mother.

    Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
    My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,
    Bid me farewell, and smile.
 Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.

  BRUTUS.

    Here comes his mother.
 Let's not meet her.
 O, Y'are well met; th' hoarded plague o' th' gods
    Requite your love!
  MENENIUS.
  [To BRUTUS] Will you be gone?
  VIRGILIA.
  [To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too.
 Are you mankind?
  VOLUMNIA.

  SICINIUS.
 I would he had.
 Now, pray, sir, get you gone;
    You have done a brave deed.
 Ere you go, hear this:
    As far as doth the Capitol exceed
    The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-  
    This lady's husband here, this, do you see?-
    Whom you have banish'd does exceed you an.
 Why stay we to be baited
    With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES

 Fie, fie, fie!                                  Exit




SCENE III.
 Truly, I have forgot you.

  ROMAN.
 What's the news in Rome? I have a
    note from the Volscian state, to find you out there.
 You have
    well saved me a day's journey.

  VOLSCE.
 Banish'd, sir.

  VOLSCE.
 I have heard it said the
    fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
    with her husband.

  ROMAN.
 Have you
    an army ready, say you?
  VOLSCE.
 I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I
    think, that shall set them in present action.
 So, sir, heartily
    well met, and most glad of your company.
 Direct me, if it be your will,
    Where great Aufidius lies.
  
  CORIOLANUS.
 Enter A SERVINGMAN

  FIRST SERVANT.
 I cannot get him
    out o' th' house.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Pray you avoid.
 What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a
    strange guest he has here.
                              Exit
  THIRD SERVANT.

  THIRD SERVANT.
 How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?
  CORIOLANUS.
 Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
    mistress.
 Where is this fellow?
  SECOND SERVANT.
 Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
    Why speak'st not? Speak, man.
  
  AUFIDIUS.
 Thy name?
  CORIOLANUS.
 Your hand; most welcome!
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS

  FIRST SERVANT.

  FIRST SERVANT.

  SECOND SERVANT.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 What, what, what? Let's partake.

  BOTH.

  FIRST SERVANT.

  SECOND SERVANT.
 Come, we are fellows and friends.

  SECOND SERVANT.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son  
    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
    asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.

    Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself
    with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.
 Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
    many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst
    not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
    whilst he's in directitude.
 Directitude? What's that?
  THIRD SERVANT.
 But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and
    the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies
    after rain, and revel an with him.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 To-morrow, to-day, presently.
 You shall have the  
    drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their
    feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
    a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
    cuckolds.
 Reason: because they then less need one another.
 In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt




SCENE VI.
 We stood to't in good time.

  SICINIUS.
 The gods preserve you both!
  SICINIUS.
 God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
 Now the gods keep you!
  BOTH TRIBUNES.
             Exeunt citizens  
  SICINIUS.
 This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when these fellows ran about the streets
    Crying confusion.
 And affecting one sole throne,
    Without assistance.
 The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
    Sits safe and still without him.

  MENENIUS.
 It cannot be
    The Volsces dare break with us.
 Cannot be!
    We have record that very well it can;
    And three examples of the like hath been
    Within my age.
 Tell not me.
  
    I know this cannot be.


                           Enter A MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.

  MESSENGER.
 Yes, worthy sir,
    The slave's report is seconded, and more,
    More fearful, is deliver'd.
 It is spoke freely out of many mouths-
    How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
    And vows revenge as spacious as between
    The young'st and oldest thing.
 This is most likely!
  BRUTUS.

  MENENIUS.
 This is unlikely.
 Your temples burned in their cement, and
    Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
    Into an auger's bore.
 Pray, your news.

    If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-
  COMINIUS.
 But is this true, sir?
  COMINIUS.
 Who is't can blame him?
    Your enemies and his find something in him.

  COMINIUS.
 Desperation
    Is all the policy, strength, and defence,
    That Rome can make against them.
 Now he's coming,
    And not a hair upon a soldier's head
    Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
    And pay you for your voices.
 Faith, we hear fearful news.

  SECOND CITIZEN.
 Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
    These are a side that would be glad to have
    This true which they so seem to fear.
 The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
                                Exeunt




SCENE VII.

A camp at a short distance from Rome

Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT

  AUFIDIUS.

  AUFIDIUS.
 But he has a merit
    To choke it in the utt'rance.
 When, Caius, Rome is thine,
    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
 SCENE I.

  MENENIUS.
 'Coriolanus'
    He would not answer to; forbid all names;
    He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
    Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
    Of burning Rome.
 We must be burnt for you.
  
  SICINIUS.
 Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
    In this so never-needed help, yet do not
    Upbraid's with our distress.
 Pray you go to him.
 What should I do?
  BRUTUS.

  MENENIUS.
 I'll undertake't;  
    I think he'll hear me.
 Not?
  COMINIUS.
 I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
    Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury  
    The gaoler to his pity.
 I kneel'd before him;
    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
    Thus with his speechless hand.
 You guard like men, 'tis well; but, by your leave,
    I am an officer of state and come
    To speak with Coriolanus.
 From whence?
  MENENIUS.
 From Rome.
 YOU may not pass; you must return.

  SECOND WATCH.
 Be it so; go back.
 I have been
    The book of his good acts whence men have read
    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
    For I have ever verified my friends-
    Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity
    Would without lapsing suffer.

  SECOND WATCH.
 Therefore go back.
 Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with
    him till after dinner.
 You are a Roman, are you?
  MENENIUS.
 You are condemn'd;
    our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.

  MENENIUS.
 Nay, but fellow, fellow-

                      Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS

  CORIOLANUS.
 The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
    Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
    look thee, here's water to quench it.
 The good gods assuage
    thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,  
    who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.
 Away!
  MENENIUS.

  AUFIDIUS.
 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the
    way home again.
 A noble fellow, I warrant him.

  CORIOLANUS.
' Let the Volsces
    Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never
    Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
    As if a man were author of himself
    And knew no other kin.

  VIRGILIA.
' O, a kiss
    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
    I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
    Hath virgin'd it e'er since.
 And to poor we
    Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
    Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
    That all but we enjoy.

    I have sat too long.
                                [Rising]
  VOLUMNIA.
 Speak thou, boy;
    Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
    Than can our reasons.

    Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
 Nay, behold's!
    This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
    But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
    Does reason our petition with more strength
    Than thou hast to deny't.
 Come, let us go.
 But let it come.
 Now, good Aufidius,
    Were you in my stead, would you have heard
    A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
  AUFIDIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.

Rome.
 There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet
    your butterfly was a grub.
 He is able to pierce a corslet with
    his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery.
 I paint him in the character.
 Mark what mercy his mother
    shall bring from him.
 No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
  

                         Enter another MESSENGER

  SICINIUS.
 As certain as I know the sun is fire.
 This is good news.
 They are near the city?
  MESSENGER.
 We'll meet them,
    And help the joy.
 Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;
    Deliver them this paper' having read it,
    Bid them repair to th' market-place, where I,
    Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
    Will vouch the truth of it.
 Him I accuse
    The city ports by this hath enter'd and
    Intends t' appear before the people, hoping
    To purge himself with words.
 How is it with our general?
  AUFIDIUS.
 Most noble sir,
    If you do hold the same intent wherein
    You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
    Of your great danger.

  AUFIDIUS.
 Sir, his stoutness
    When he did stand for consul, which he lost
    By lack of stooping-  
  AUFIDIUS.
 I took him;
    Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
    In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
    Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
    My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments
    In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
    Which he did end all his, and took some pride
    To do myself this wrong.
 There was it;
    For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
 But, hark!
                                                      [Drums and
                trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people]
  FIRST CONSPIRATOR.
 I have not deserv'd it.
 You are to know
    That prosperously I have attempted, and
    With bloody passage led your wars even to
    The gates of Rome.
 Our spoils we have brought home
    Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
    The charges of the action.
 We have made peace
    With no less honour to the Antiates
    Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver,
    Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,
    Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what
    We have compounded on.
 Read it not, noble lords;
    But tell the traitor in the highest degree
    He hath abus'd your powers.

    Alone I did it.

  ALL THE PEOPLE.
 Tear him to pieces.
 He kill'd my cousin Marcus.
 Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!  
    The man is noble, and his fame folds in
    This orb o' th' earth.
 His last offences to us
    Shall have judicious hearing.
 My noble masters, hear me speak.
 Please it your honours
    To call me to your Senate, I'll deliver
    Myself your loyal servant, or endure
    Your heaviest censure.
 My rage is gone,
    And I am struck with sorrow.
 Take him up.
 You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
    No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
    Still seem as does the King's.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 You speak him far.
 What's his name and birth?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 His only child.
 That a king's children should be so convey'd,
    So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
    That could not trace them!
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 I do well believe you.
 No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
    After the slander of most stepmothers,
    Evil-ey'd unto you.
 Please your Highness,
    I will from hence to-day.

  QUEEN.
 [Aside] Yet I'll move him
    To walk this way.
 I never do him wrong
    But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
    Pays dear for my offences.
 Nay, stay a little.

    Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
    Such parting were too petty.
     [Puts a bracelet on her arm]

    When shall we see again?

  IMOGEN.
 O disloyal thing,
    That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
    A year's age on me!
  IMOGEN.

  CYMBELINE.

  IMOGEN.
- Peace,
    Dear lady daughter, peace!- Sweet sovereign,
    Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
    Out of your best advice.
 Ha!
    No harm, I trust, is done?
  PISANIO.
 Why came you from your master?  
  PISANIO.
 He would not suffer me
    To bring him to the haven; left these notes
    Of what commands I should be subject to,
    When't pleas'd you to employ me.

  QUEEN.
 If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it.
 It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
 Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
    not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
    of her wit.
 [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
    an ass, which is no great hurt.

  CLOTEN.
 I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,
    And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
    And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
    As offer'd mercy is.
 Madam, so I did.
 But, good Pisanio,
    When shall we hear from him?
  PISANIO.

  IMOGEN.
 Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
 He was then
    of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
    been allowed the name of.
 This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he
    must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I
    doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

  FRENCHMAN.
 And then his banishment.
 But how comes it
    he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
  PHILARIO.
 Let him be so entertained amongst you as
    suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
    quality.
 I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman,
    whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine.
 How worthy he is
    I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his
    own hearing.
 I was glad I did
    atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have
    been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,
    upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

  FRENCHMAN.
 It was much like
    an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in
    praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
    vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more
    fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less
    attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

  IACHIMO.
 That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion,
    by this, worn out.

  POSTHUMUS.
 She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.

  IACHIMO.
 You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
 So do I my stone.

  IACHIMO.

  POSTHUMUS.
 Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
    convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of
    that you term her frail.
 But I make
    my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and,
    to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
    lady in the world.

  IACHIMO.

  PHILARIO.
 I dare you to
    this match: here's my ring.

  IACHIMO.
 If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have
    trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours-
    provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.

  IACHIMO.
 Agreed.
 Will this hold, think you?
  PHILARIO.
 Signior Iachimo will not from it.
 Here they are, madam.
 Your Highness
    Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
    Besides, the seeing these effects will be
    Both noisome and infectious.
 O, content thee.
 [Aside] I do not like her.

  QUEEN.
                        Exit  
  QUEEN.

    When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
    As great as is thy master; greater, for
    His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
    Is at last gasp.
 What shalt thou expect
    To be depender on a thing that leans,
    Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
    So much as but to prop him?
                  [The QUEEN drops the box.

    It is a thing I made, which hath the King
    Five times redeem'd from death.
 Nay, I prithee take it;
    It is an earnest of a further good
    That I mean to thee.
 Call my women.

    Think on my words.
 A father cruel and a step-dame false;
    A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
    That hath her husband banish'd.
 O, that husband!
    My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
    Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
    As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
    Is the desire that's glorious.

  IACHIMO.
       LEONATUS.
 What is the matter, trow?
  IACHIMO.
 What, dear sir,
    Thus raps you? Are you well?
  IACHIMO.
 Thanks, madam; well.
 I was going, sir,
    To give him welcome.

    It is an office of the gods to venge it,
    Not mine to speak on't.

 Not I
    Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
    The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces  
    That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
    Charms this report out.

  IACHIMO.
 Should he make me  
    Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,
    Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
    In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
 What ho, Pisanio!
  IACHIMO.

  IMOGEN.
 My humble thanks.
 Pray what is't?
  IACHIMO.
 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels  
    Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
    And I am something curious, being strange,
    To have them in safe stowage.

 No more.
 To what end?
    Why should I write this down that's riveted,
    Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
    The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
    Where Philomel gave up.
 You are most hot and furious when you win.
 I am advised to give her
    music a mornings; they say it will penetrate.
 First, a very excellent good-conceited
    thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to
    it- and then let her consider.
 If this penetrate, I will consider your music
    the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which
    horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
    boot, can never amend.

  CYMBELINE.
 We must receive him
    According to the honour of his sender;
    And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
    We must extend our notice.
 By your leave, ho!     [Knocks]
    I know her women are about her; what
    If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
    Which buys admittance; oft it doth-yea, and makes
    Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
    Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold
    Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
    Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man.

    By your leave.
                                      [Knocks]

                            Enter a LADY

  LADY.
 The thanks I give
    Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
    And scarce can spare them.

  CLOTEN.

  IMOGEN.

  IMOGEN.

    And though it be allowed in meaner parties-
    Yet who than he more mean?- to knit their souls-
    On whom there is no more dependency
    But brats and beggary- in self-figur'd knot,
    Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
    The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil
    The precious note of it with a base slave,
    A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
    A pantler- not so eminent!
  IMOGEN.
 'His garment'!
  IMOGEN.

  IMOGEN.
                 Exit PISANIO
  CLOTEN.

    'His meanest garment'!
  IMOGEN.

    If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.
 I will inform your father.

  IMOGEN.
 Your mother too.
 So I leave you, sir,
    To th' worst of discontent.
                             Exit
  CLOTEN.

Rome.

  PHILARIO.
 Our countrymen
    Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
    Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage
    Worthy his frowning at.
 See! Iachimo!
  POSTHUMUS.
 Welcome, sir.

  PHILARIO.
 Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
    When you were there?
  IACHIMO.
 The stone's too hard to come by.
 Make not, sir,
    Your loss your sport.
 Had I not brought
    The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
    We were to question farther; but I now
    Profess myself the winner of her honour,
    Together with your ring; and not the wronger
    Of her or you, having proceeded but
    By both your wills.

  POSTHUMUS.

  IACHIMO.
 More particulars
    Must justify my knowledge.

  POSTHUMUS.
 This is her honour!
    Let it be granted you have seen all this, and praise
    Be given to your remembrance; the description
    Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
    The wager you have laid.
 I beg but leave to air this jewel.
 See!
    And now 'tis up again.
 It must be married
    To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
 Jove!
    Once more let me behold it.
 Sir- I thank her- that.

  POSTHUMUS.
 O, no, no, no! 'tis true.
 The vows of women
    Of no more bondage be to where they are made
    Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.

    O, above measure false!
  PHILARIO.
 Have patience, sir,
    And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
  
    'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true.

  IACHIMO.
 You do remember
    This stain upon her?  
  POSTHUMUS.
 Ay, and it doth confirm
    Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
    Were there no more but it.
 Will you hear more?
  POSTHUMUS.

    If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
    And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
    Thou'st made me cuckold.

  IACHIMO.
 I'll do something-                          Exit
  PHILARIO.

    Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
    He hath against himself.
 O, vengeance, vengeance!
    Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,
    And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
    A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
    Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
    As chaste as unsunn'd snow.
 Be it lying, note it,
    The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
    Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
    Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
    Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
    All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,
    Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;
    For even to vice
    They are not constant, but are changing still
    One vice but of a minute old for one
    Not half so old as that.
 Yet 'tis greater skill
    In a true hate to pray they have their will:
    The very devils cannot plague them better.
              Exit

 SCENE I.
 A hall in CYMBELINE'S palace

Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and LORDS at one door,
and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and attendants

  CYMBELINE.
 When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet
    Lives in men's eyes, and will to ears and tongues
    Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain,
    And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
    Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less
    Than in his feats deserving it, for him
    And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
    Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
    Is left untender'd.
 And, to kill the marvel,
    Shall be so ever.
 There be many Caesars
    Ere such another Julius.

  CLOTEN.
 We do.
 Say then to Caesar,  
    Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
    Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar
    Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
    Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
    Though Rome be therefore angry.
 Thus defied,
    I thank thee for myself.

  LUCIUS.
 Let proof speak.

  CLOTEN.
 His majesty bids you welcome.
 I know your master's pleasure, and he mine;
    All the remain is, welcome.
                           Exeunt




SCENE II.
 How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
    What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!
    O master, what a strange infection
    Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian-
    As poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd
    On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.

    She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
    More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
    As would take in some virtue.
 O my master!
    Thy mind to her is now as low as were
    Thy fortunes.
 The letter  
    That I have sent her, by her own command
    Shall give thee opportunity.

  IMOGEN.
 Good news, gods!
                                                         [Reads]
    'Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his
    dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of
    creatures, would even renew me with your eyes.
 If one of mean affairs
    May plod it in a week, why may not I
    Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio-
    Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st-  
    O, let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st,
    But in a fainter kind- O, not like me,
    For mine's beyond beyond!-say, and speak thick-
    Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
    To th' smothering of the sense- how far it is
    To this same blessed Milford.
 And by th' way
    Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
    T' inherit such a haven.
 Prithee speak,
    How many score of miles may we well ride
    'Twixt hour and hour?
  PISANIO.
 Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
    Could never go so slow.
 I have heard of riding wagers
    Where horses have been nimbler than the sands  
    That run i' th' clock's behalf.

    Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
    She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
    A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
    A franklin's huswife.

  PISANIO.
 Away, I prithee;
    Do as I bid thee.
 A goodly day not to keep house with such
    Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
    Instructs you how t' adore the heavens, and bows you
    To a morning's holy office.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Hail, heaven!
  BELARIUS.
 Now for our mountain sport.
  
    This service is not service so being done,
    But being so allow'd.
 No life to ours!
  GUIDERIUS.
 Out of your proof you speak.
 But unto us it is
    A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
    A prison for a debtor that not dares
    To stride a limit.

    Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
    We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,
    And sing our bondage freely.
 Then was I as a tree
    Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night
    A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
    Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
    And left me bare to weather.
 But up to th' mountains!
    This is not hunters' language.

    They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly
    I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
    The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
    In simple and low things to prince it much
    Beyond the trick of others.
 Hark, the game is rous'd!
    O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
    Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,
    At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
    Thinking to bar thee of succession as
    Thou refts me of my lands.
 My husband's hand?
    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
    And he's at some hard point.

  IMOGEN.
 I speak not
    out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as
    certain as I expect my revenge.
 Let
    thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity
    at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if
    thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art
    the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.
 What cheer, madam?
  IMOGEN.
  
  PISANIO.
 So thou, Posthumus,
    Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men:
    Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
    From thy great fail.
 Look!
    I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit
    The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
 Thus may poor fools
    Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd
    Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
    Stands in worse case of woe.
 Where's thy knife?
    Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
    When I desire it too.

  IMOGEN.
 Do't, and to bed then.
 I'll wake mine eyeballs first.
 Good lady,
    Hear me with patience.

  IMOGEN.
 It cannot be
    But that my master is abus'd.

  PISANIO.
 O! for such means,
    Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
    I would adventure.

    Fore-thinking this, I have already fit-
    'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
    That answer to them.
 This attempt
    I am soldier to, and will abide it with
    A prince's courage.
 Away, I prithee.

Britain.

  CYMBELINE.
 So, sir.
 My lords, you are appointed for that office;
    The due of honour in no point omit.
 Your hand, my lord.
 It fits us therefore ripely
    Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
 But, my gentle queen,  
    Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
    Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
    The duty of the day.
 Beseech your Majesty,
    Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady
    So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,
    And strokes death to her.
 That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
    I have not seen these two days.
 Go, look after.
 I pray his absence
    Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes
    It is a thing most precious.

    Go in and cheer the King.

  QUEEN.
 All the better.
 O good my lord!
  CLOTEN.
 Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter-
    I will not ask again.
 Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
 No more of 'worthy lord'!
    Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
    Thy condemnation and thy death.

  CLOTEN.
 Sir, I will.
 Give me thy hand; here's my purse.
 Hast any of thy late
    master's garments in thy possession?
  PISANIO.

  PISANIO.
 Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing;
    I'll remember't anon.
 I would these garments were come.
 She said upon a
    time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she
    held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble
    and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities.
 She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my
    revenge.
 My revenge is now at Milford, would
    I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
 Before the cave of BELARIUS

Enter IMOGEN alone, in boy's clothes

  IMOGEN.
 Two beggars told me
    I could not miss my way.
 To lapse in fulness
    Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood
    Is worse in kings than beggars.
 Ho! who's here?
    If anything that's civil, speak; if savage,
    Take or lend.
 Come, our stomachs
    Will make what's homely savoury; weariness
    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth  
    Finds the down pillow hard.

  BELARIUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Here's money for my meat.

  GUIDERIUS.

  IMOGEN.
 I see you're angry.

    Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
    Have died had I not made it.
 I have a kinsman who
    Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
    To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
    I am fall'n in this offence.

  BELARIUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 'Mongst friends,
    If brothers.

  IMOGEN.
 Fair youth, come in.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 A public place

Enter two ROMAN SENATORS and TRIBUNES

  FIRST SENATOR.
 Ay.
 With those legions
    Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
    Must be supplyant.
 SCENE I.
 I am near to th' place where they should meet, if Pisanio
    have mapp'd it truly.
 Yet this imperceiverant
    thing loves him in my despite.
 My horse is tied up safe.
 Out, sword, and to a
    sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand.
 This is the very
    description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not
    deceive me.

    Are we not brothers?
  IMOGEN.
 So man and man should be;
    But clay and clay differs in dignity,
    Whose dust is both alike.
 I am ill, but your being by me
    Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
    To one not sociable.
 I am not very sick,
    Since I can reason of it.
 The bier at door,
    And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
    'My father, not this youth.
 [Aside] O noble strain!
    O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
    Cowards father cowards and base things sire base.

  ARVIRAGUS.

    He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
    Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

  BELARIUS.
 We'll not be long away.

  BELARIUS.

  ARVIRAGUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 It is great morning.

  BELARIUS.
 We are held as outlaws.
 Thou art some fool;
    I am loath to beat thee.

  CLOTEN.
 Thou injurious thief,
    Hear but my name, and tremble.
 Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
    I cannot tremble at it.

  CLOTEN.

    Yield, rustic mountaineer.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 In this place we left them.

  BELARIUS.
 Not Hercules
    Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none;
    Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
    My head as I do his.
 Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
    But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
    Protects not us; then why should we be tender
    To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
    Play judge and executioner all himself,
    For we do fear the law? What company
    Discover you abroad?
  BELARIUS.
 No single soul  
    Can we set eye on, but in an safe reason
    He must have some attendants.

  BELARIUS.
 With his own sword,
    Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
    His head from him.

    Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valour
    Becomes thee well enough.

  ARVIRAGUS.
                               [Solemn music]
  BELARIUS.
 The matter?
    Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
    Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.

    Is Cadwal mad?
  
       Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, bearing
                         her in his arms

  BELARIUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
  
    How found you him?
  ARVIRAGUS.
 Stark, as you see;
    Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
    Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek
    Reposing on a cushion.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Where?
  ARVIRAGUS.
 Why, he but sleeps.
 With fairest flowers,
    Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
    I'll sweeten thy sad grave.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 Say, where shall's lay him?
  GUIDERIUS.
 By good Euriphile, our mother.
 Be't so;
    And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
    Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground,
    As once to our mother; use like note and words,
    Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
 Cadwal,
    I cannot sing.
 Our foe was princely;
    And though you took his life, as being our foe,
    Yet bury him as a prince.
 Pray you fetch him hither.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 So.
 Fear no more the heat o' th' sun
               Nor the furious winter's rages;
             Thou thy worldly task hast done,
               Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.

  
  GUIDERIUS.

  BOTH.
 Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
  ARVIRAGUS.
 Apart upon our knees.
 By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?
    'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?
    I have gone all night.
 Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
 O gods and goddesses!
                                               [Seeing the body]
    These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world;
    This bloody man, the care on't.
 How should this be? Pisanio?  
    'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
    Have laid this woe here.
 O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
    The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
    And cordial to me, have I not found it
    Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home.
 But what from Rome?
  CAPTAIN.
 The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
    And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,  
    That promise noble service; and they come
    Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
    Sienna's brother.
 This forwardness
    Makes our hopes fair.
 Command our present numbers
    Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't.

    Let's see the boy's face.
 He'll then instruct us of this body.
 Alas!
    There is no more such masters.
 Thou dost approve thyself the very same;
    Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
 The Roman Emperor's letters,
    Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
    Than thine own worth prefer thee.
 I'll follow, sir.
 But first, an't please the gods,
    I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
    As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
    With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
    And on it said a century of prayers,  
    Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
    And leaving so his service, follow you,
    So please you entertain me.
 Boy, he is preferr'd
    By thee to us; and he shall be interr'd
    As soldiers can.

    Some falls are means the happier to arise.
            Exeunt




SCENE III.
 CYMBELINE'S palace

Enter CYMBELINE, LORDS, PISANIO, and attendants

  CYMBELINE.

  LORD.
 Good my liege,
    Your preparation can affront no less
    Than what you hear of.

    The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion  
    That long to move.
 Away!      Exeunt all but PISANIO
  PISANIO.

Wales.

    To the King's party there's no going.
 This is, sir, a doubt
    In such a time nothing becoming you
    Nor satisfying us.
 And, besides, the King
    Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves,
    Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
    The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
    To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd,
    But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
    The shrinking slaves of winter.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Than be so,  
    Better to cease to be.
 By this sun that shines,
    I'll thither.
 No reason I, since of your lives you set
    So slight a valuation, should reserve
    My crack'd one to more care.

    Lead, lead.
 Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee; for I wish'd
    Thou shouldst be colour'd thus.

Another part of the field

Enter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD

  LORD.
 Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?
  POSTHUMUS.
 I did:
    Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
 No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,
    But that the heavens fought.
 Forthwith they fly,
    Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
    The strides they victors made; and now our cowards,
    Like fragments in hard voyages, became
    The life o' th' need.
 Having found the back-door open
    Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
    Some slain before, some dying, some their friends
    O'erborne i' th' former wave.
 This was strange chance:
    A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
 Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made  
    Rather to wonder at the things you hear
    Than to work any.
'
  LORD.

  LORD.
 Being an ugly monster,
    'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
    Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we
    That draw his knives i' th' war.
 Well, I will find him;
    For being now a favourer to the Briton,
    No more a Briton, I have resum'd again
    The part I came in.
 Stand! who's there?
  POSTHUMUS.
 A Roman,
    Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
    Had answer'd him.
 Exeunt omnes




SCENE IV.
 Must I repent,
    I cannot do it better than in gyves,
    Desir'd more than constrain'd.
 O Imogen!
    I'll speak to thee in silence.
 Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS
        LEONATUS, father to POSTHUMUS, an old man attired
         like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient
          matron, his WIFE, and mother to POSTHUMUS, with
        music before them.

 For this from stiller seats we came,
              Our parents and us twain,
            That, striking in our country's cause,
              Fell bravely and were slain,
            Our fealty and Tenantius' right
              With honour to maintain.

       JUPITER descends-in thunder and lightning, sitting
       upon an eagle.

    This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
    Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine;  
    And so, away; no farther with your din
    Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
 His royal bird
    Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,
    As when his god is pleas'd.
 Thanks, Jupiter!

    What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
    Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
    Nobler than that it covers.
 Let thy effects
    So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,
    As good as promise.

  GAOLER.
 Come, sir, are you ready for death?
  POSTHUMUS.

  GAOLER.
 Hanging is the word, sir; if you be ready for that, you are
    well cook'd.

  POSTHUMUS.
 So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish
    pays the shot.
 But the comfort is, you
    shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills,
    which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth.
 I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

  GAOLER.
 Your death has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so
    pictur'd.
 You must either be directed by some that take upon them
    to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
    know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril.
 What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the
    best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging's  
    the way of winking.


                        Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.
 I'll be hang'd then.

  POSTHUMUS.
 Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the
    dead.
 I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good.
 Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
    Preservers of my throne.
 Woe is my heart
    That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
    Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast
    Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.
 I never saw
    Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
    Such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought
    But beggary and poor looks.

  CYMBELINE.
 No tidings of him?
  PISANIO.

  CYMBELINE.
 Report it.

    Arise my knights o' th' battle; I create you
    Companions to our person, and will fit you
    With dignities becoming your estates.

  CYMBELINE.
 Who worse than a physician
    Would this report become? But I consider
    By med'cine'life may be prolong'd, yet death
    Will seize the doctor too.
 Prithee say.
 First, she confess'd she never lov'd you; only
    Affected greatness got by you, not you;
    Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
    Abhorr'd your person.

  CYMBELINE.
 Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love  
    With such integrity, she did confess
    Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
    But that her flight prevented it, she had
    Ta'en off by poison.
 Heard you all this, her women?  
  LADY.

  CYMBELINE.
 The day
    Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,  
    We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd
    Our prisoners with the sword.
 I have surely seen him;
    His favour is familiar to me.

  IMOGEN.
 No, no! Alack,
    There's other work in hand.

  CYMBELINE.
 Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
    I'll be thy master.

    Creatures may be alike; were't he, I am sure
    He would have spoke to us.

  BELARIUS.

  PISANIO.
 Come, stand thou by our side;
    Make thy demand aloud.
 How? me?
  IACHIMO.

  IACHIMO.

  IACHIMO.
 Upon a time- unhappy was the clock
    That struck the hour!- was in Rome- accurs'd
    The mansion where!- 'twas at a feast- O, would
    Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
    Those which I heav'd to head!- the good Posthumus-
    What should I say? he was too good to be
    Where ill men were, and was the best of all
    Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly  
    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
    For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
    Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming
    The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,
    Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,
    A shop of all the qualities that man
    Loves woman for; besides that hook of wiving,
    Fairness which strikes the eye-
  CYMBELINE.

  IACHIMO.
 Your daughter's chastity- there it begins.
 Well may you, sir,
    Remember me at court, where I was taught
    Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
    'Twixt amorous and villainous.
 Does the world go round?
  POSTHUMUS.
 If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
    To death with mortal joy.

  CYMBELINE.
 It poison'd me.
 What's this, Cornelius?
  CORNELIUS.

  BELARIUS.
 O, she was naught, and long of her it was
    That we meet here so strangely; but her son
    Is gone, we know not how nor where.
 My lord,
    Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth.
 Lord Cloten,
    Upon my lady's missing, came to me
    With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
    If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
    It was my instant death.
 By accident  
    I had a feigned letter of my master's
    Then in my pocket, which directed him
    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
    Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
    Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts
    With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
    My lady's honour.
 I cut off's head,  
    And am right glad he is not standing here
    To tell this tale of mine.

    By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
    Endure our law.
 Thou'rt dead.

  IMOGEN.
 Bind the offender,
    And take him from our presence.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 What of him? He is
    A banish'd traitor.

  CYMBELINE.
 Take him hence,
    The whole world shall not save him.

    First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,  
    And let it be confiscate all, so soon
    As I have receiv'd it.
 These gentle princes-
    For such and so they are- these twenty years
    Have I train'd up; those arts they have as
    Could put into them.
 Their nurse, Euriphile,  
    Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
    Upon my banishment; I mov'd her to't,
    Having receiv'd the punishment before
    For that which I did then.
 Thou weep'st and speak'st.

  BELARIUS.

    This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
    Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;  
    This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
    Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
    In a most curious mantle, wrought by th' hand
    Of his queen mother, which for more probation
    I can with ease produce.

  IMOGEN.
 No, my lord;
    I have got two worlds by't.
 O my gentle brothers,  
    Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
    But I am truest speaker! You call'd me brother,
    When I was but your sister: I you brothers,
    When we were so indeed.

  CYMBELINE.

  CYMBELINE.
 Let them be joyful too,
    For they shall taste our comfort.
 The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
    He would have well becom'd this place and grac'd
    The thankings of a king.
 I had you down, and might
    Have made you finish.

  POSTHUMUS.

  CYMBELINE.
 Nobly doom'd!
    We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
    Pardon's the word to all.
 Let him show
    His skill in the construction.
 Here, my good lord.

  CYMBELINE.

  CYMBELINE.
 The fingers of the pow'rs above do tune
    The harmony of this peace.

  CYMBELINE.

  Ber.
 Well, good night.


                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
 Bernardo hath my place.
                                   Exit.
 Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor.
 I have seen nothing.

 Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

  Mar.
 Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet.

    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.
- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
  
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
 Do, if it will not stand.
 It faded on the crowing of the cock.

    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
           Exeunt.


Flourish.
 [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
    With this affair along.
, Volt.

    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer.
 My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,  
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
 Not so, my lord.

  Queen.
 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
 These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.
 I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself.
 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
 Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.

  Hor.

  Hor.
 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
 Saw? who?
  Hor.
 Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red.
 This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes.

  Ham.
 My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none.

  Ham.

  Hor.
 As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
 Arm'd, my lord.

  Ham.

  Ham.

  Hor.

  Ham.
 Most constantly.
 It would have much amaz'd you.

  Both.
 I will watch to-night.

    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
 Farewell.
 Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul.

    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.

    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
 I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart.

  Pol.

    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

  Pol.
 The time invites you.
 Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

  Laer.
 What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph.
 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
 Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
 My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
 From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
 For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you.

Elsinore.

  Ham.
 What hour now?
  Hor.
 It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
 The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.


                         Enter Ghost.
 Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham.
 No, by no means!
  Ham.
 It will not speak.
 Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
    It waves me forth again.
 I'll follow it.

    Go on.
 You shall not go, my lord.

  Ham.
 Be rul'd.

  Hor.

                                                         Exeunt.


Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
 I am bound to hear.
 What?
  Ghost.
 I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away.

    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood.
 List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham.
 O God!
  Ghost.
 Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
 So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd.

  Ham.
 O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost.

    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
 O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost.

    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.
  
  Ham.
 Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
        [Writes.
 Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.
'  
    I have sworn't.
 Lord Hamlet!
  Hor.
 O, wonderful!
  Hor.
 Good my lord, tell it.
 No, you will reveal it.
 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

  Hor.
 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

  Hor.
 There's no offence, my lord.

  Both.

  Hor.


                 Ghost cries under the stage.


  Ghost.

  Ham.

    Consent to swear.
 Never to speak of this that you have seen.

    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
 [beneath] Swear.

                                                   [They swear.

    The time is out of joint.

Elsinore.

  Pol.
 You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
 Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.

    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.

  Pol.
 But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
 Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
 Very good, my lord.

  Pol.

    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
 You have me, have you not
  Rey.
 Good my lord!                                    [Going.
]
  Pol.
 I shall, my lord.
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.

  Pol.
 I will go seek the King.
 I am sorry.

  Pol.
 I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion.

    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

  Queen.

  Guil.
 Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].


  Pol.
 Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.

  King.
 Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

                                                [Exit Polonius.
 I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
 Well, we shall sift him.
 Most fair return of greetings and desires.

    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.

  Pol.

    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief.
 And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
 Now gather, and surmise.
]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.
 Good madam, stay awhile.

      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
                                                          HAMLET.

    This must not be.
?
  King.

  Pol.
 [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
      be otherwise.
 If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
    But keep a farm and carters.

  Pol.

                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
 Then I would you were so honest a man.

  Ham.
 Let her not walk i' th' sun.

  Pol.
 [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
- What do you
    read, my lord?
  Ham.
 Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams.
 [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.
 Into my grave?
  Pol.
 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.
 There he is.
  
  Guil.
 Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros.

  Ham.
 Denmark's a prison.
 'Tis too narrow for your
    mind.

  Ham.

  Ros.
 Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows.
 Shall we to th' court? for, by my
    fay, I cannot reason.

  Both.
 We'll wait upon you.

    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me.
 But let me conjure you by the rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  
  Ros.

  Guil.
 My lord, we were sent for.

  Ros.
 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort.


  Guil.

  Ham.


  Pol.
 Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.

  Ros.
 Mark it.

  Pol.
 When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome-
  Pol.
 Upon my honour-
  Ham.

  Ham.
 Play.

  Pol.
 Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
      Th' unnerved father falls.

      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol.
 It shall to the barber's, with your beard.
 That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
 Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
    eyes.

  Ham.
 God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
    honour and dignity.

  Ham.
 Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night.
 The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.

 Scene I.
 Most like a gentleman.

  Ros.

  King.
 With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.

    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
 Madam, I wish it may.
]
  Pol.
 There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.

    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.
- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
 What means your lordship?
  Ham.

  Oph.
 Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
    translate beauty into his likeness.
 I did love you once.

  Oph.
 Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

  Ham.
 Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house.

  Oph.
 Go, farewell.
 Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
    me mad.
 To a nunnery, go.
 O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.


  King.
- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
    To show his grief.





Scene II.
 O, it offends me to the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
    shows and noise.
 It out-herods Herod.

  Ham.

  Player.
 For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered.
 What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.
 Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
 [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums.
 Danish
    march.


  Ham.

  King.
 I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
 These words are not
    mine.

  Ham.
 [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol.

  Ham.
 It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.
 They stay upon your patience.

  Ham.
 Here's metal more attractive.

  Pol.
 [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham.

  Ham.
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
 What is, my lord?
  Ham.

  Ham.
 O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
    within 's two hours.
 But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play.
 The dead body is
    carried away.

                                                         Exeunt.


  Oph.
 Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
 Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham.
 For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.

  Ham.


              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.
 So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.

      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.

      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.

      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.

      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.

    Queen.
 If she should break it now!

    King.
 The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
 'The Mousetrap.
 You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

  Ham.
 You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

  Ham.

  Ham.
 Pox, leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.
 The King rises.

  Ham.
 What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen.
   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.

  Ham.

  Ham.

  Ham.
 Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.

  Guil.

  Ham.

  Guil.
 You are welcome.

    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.

  Guil.
 But, sir, such
    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
    my mother.
 Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros.
 And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros.
 Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
    musty.

  Ham.
 Believe me, I cannot.

  Ham.
 I know, no touch of it, my lord.
 Look you, these are the stops.
 I
    have not the skill.


                        Enter Polonius.
 My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.

  Ham.
 Very like a whale.
 Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.
 Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.

  Ros.
 Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.

  Both.
 We will haste us.


                   Enter Polonius.

    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process.

    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.

  King.

                                                Exit [Polonius].
 Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't.

    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
    No.
 My mother stays.

The Queen's closet.

  Ham.

                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.

  Queen.
 Come, come, and sit you down.
 [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
 A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
 As kill a king?
  Ham.
 Ay, lady, it was my word.

                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.

    Leave wringing of your hinds.
 O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks  
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.

  Queen.

    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother.

  Queen.
 A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!  
  Queen.
 No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
 This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.

    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.

  Ham.
 On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.

  Ham.
 It is not madness
    That I have utt'red.
 Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from.

    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on.

  Queen.
 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  
    This man shall set me packing.

    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.


  King.
 There's matter in these sighs.
]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King.
 What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen.

  King.
 O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.

    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
 He weeps for what is done.

  King.

  
    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
 A passage in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet.
 (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham.


  Ros.
 Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
 Do not believe it.
 But such officers do the King best service in
    the end.
 When he needs what you have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
    again.
 My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
    the King.
 Bring me to him.


    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros.
 Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  
  King.
 Your worm is your
    only emperor for diet.
 We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
    we fat ourselves for maggots.
 Alas, alas!
  Ham.

  King.

                                            [Exeunt Attendants.
 Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness.

    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
 Ay, Hamlet.

  Ham.
 I'll be with you straight.
 Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know

 Calmly, good Laertes.
 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;

 Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,

    That he which hath your noble father slain

    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,

    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
    Had witchcraft in't.

' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday.


       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
 Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.

 It might, my lord.

  Ham.
 Did these bones cost no more the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.

                                      Throws up [another skull].
 Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown.
 You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
 Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine.

- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown.

  Ham.
 Why?

 How strangely?
  Clown.

 Why he more than another?
  Clown.
 Whose was it?
  Clown.

    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes.
 And now how abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it.

  Ham.

 Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet.

    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.

    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
 Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,

    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.

    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,

 It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

  Ham.
 I beseech you remember.

  Osr.

  Ham.
 Of Laertes?
  Hor.

  Ham.
 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.

  Ham.

  Osr.
 Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
  Osr.
 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  
  Ham.
 He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it.


  Lord.
 He sends to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
    take longer time.

  Ham.
 You will lose this wager, my lord.
 I shall win at the odds.
 If your mind dislike anything, obey it.

  Ham.
 If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
    the readiness is all.


    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.

               A table and flagons of wine on it.
 I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge.
 But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
 Come on.
 In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.

  Ham.
  
  King.
 Give them the foils, young Osric.
 Very well, my lord.
 Come on, sir.

  Laer.
 Come, my lord.

  Laer.

  Laer.
 Stay, give me drink.

               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
 A touch, a touch; I do confess't.

  King.
 He's fat, and scant of breath.
 Gertrude, do not drink.

  Queen.
 My lord, I'll hit him now.
 Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.
 It is here, Hamlet.
                    Hurts the King.

  All.

  Ham.

    I am dead, Horatio.

    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
 As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup.
         [March afar off, and shot within.
]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr.
 O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.

    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights  
    On Fortinbras.

  Hor.

    Where should We have our thanks?
  Hor.

    He never gave commandment for their death.

    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about.

    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.

    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.

 Scene I.


  King.

    But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,
    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.

  King.
 Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,
    Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
    Stain'd with the variation of each soil
    Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
    And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
 Of prisoners, Hotspur took
    Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
    To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,
    Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.

    And is not this an honourable spoil?
    A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
  West.

  West.
 This is his uncle's teaching, this Worcester,  
    Malevolent to you In all aspects,
    Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
    The crest of youth against your dignity.
 Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
  Prince.
 Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and
    unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after
    noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
    wouldest truly know.

  Fal.
 Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go
    by the moon And the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that
    wand'ring knight so fair.
 And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art
    king, as, God save thy Grace-Majesty I should say, for grace thou
    wilt have none-
  Prince.
 Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of
    us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being
    governed, as the sea is, by the moon.
 As, for proof now: a purse
    of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most
    dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by,'
    and spent with crying 'Bring in'; now ill as low an ebb as the
    foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge
    of the gallows.
 Well, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
 Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
  Fal.
 Yea, and so us'd it that, were it not here apparent that thou
    art heir apparent- But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be
    gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution
    thus fubb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the
    law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

  Prince.

  Fal.
 Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
 O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to
    corrupt a saint.

  Prince.
 Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
  Fal.
 An I do not, call
    me villain and baffle me.
 Hear ye, Yedward: if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you
    for going.

  Poins.
 There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,
    nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand
    for ten shillings.

  Prince.
 Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
 Why, that's well said.
 Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears
    of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears
    may be believed, that the true prince may (for recreation sake)
    prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
    countenance.
 Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
                                                  Exit Falstaff.
 How shall we part with them in setting forth?
  Poins.

  Poins.
 Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred
    cowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight
    longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms.
 The virtue of
    this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat  
    rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,
    he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he
    endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.

  Poins.
 I know you all, and will awhile uphold
    The unyok'd humour of your idleness.

    Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
    Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
    To smother up his beauty from the world,
    That, when he please again to lie himself,
    Being wanted, he may be more wond'red at
    By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
    Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.

  North.
 Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
    Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
 When we need
    'Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.

                                                 Exit Worcester.

  Hot.

    Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,
    Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
    Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
    Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
    And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
    Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants.
 My Lord Northumberland,
    We license your departure with your son.
-
    Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
 An if the devil come and roar for them,
    I will not send them.
 I cannot blame him.

    By God, he shall not have a Scot of them!
    No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.

    I'll keep them, by this hand!
  Wor.

    And lend no ear unto my purposes.
'
    Nay;  
    I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
    Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
    To keep his anger still in motion.
 Farewell, kinsman.
 At Berkeley Castle.
 You say true.

    We will stay your leisure.

    Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
    And make the Douglas' son your only mean
    For powers In Scotland; which, for divers reasons  
    Which I shall send you written, be assur'd
    Will easily be granted.

    I speak not this in estimation,
    As what I think might be, but what I know
    Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
    And only stays but to behold the face
    Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

  North.
 Farewell, good brother.
 Uncle, adieu.

 I am accurs'd to rob in that thief's company.

 Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
 Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?

 Stand!

    The thieves are scattered, and possess'd with fear

Enter Hotspur solus, reading a letter.


  Hot.
 What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good
    plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good
    plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
    very good friends.
 I will set
    forward to-night.
 Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
  Serv.
 One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

  Hot.
 In faith,
    I'll know your business, Harry; that I will!
    I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
    About his title and hath sent for you
    To line his enterprise; but if you go-
  Hot.

  Hot.
 This is no world
    To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.
 Kate:
    I must not have you henceforth question me
    Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.

Eastcheap.
 Where hast been, Hal?
    Prince,.
 To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an
    hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during
    my life.
 Thou art perfect.

 Anon, anon, sir.
 How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

 About Michaelmas next I shall be-

 Pray stay a little, my lord.
  
  Poins.

    Francis-
  Fran.

  Fran.
 Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?
              Here they both call him.
  

  Vint.
 What, stand'st thou still, and hear'st such a calling? Look
    to the guests within.

                                                  [Exit Vintner.


                          Enter Poins.


  Prince.


           Enter Falstaff, [Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto;
                   Francis follows with wine].
 A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry and
    amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.

    There lives not three good men unhang'd in England; and one of
    them is fat, and grows old.
 I call thee coward? I'll see thee damn'd ere I call thee
    coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as
    thou canst.
 Give me
    a cup of sack.

  Fal.
 What's the matter?
  Fal.

  Prince.
 We four set upon some dozen-
  Fal.

  Gads.
 No, no, they were not bound.
 Pray God you have not murd'red some of them.

  Poins.
 These four came all afront and mainly thrust at me.
 Seven? Why, there were but four even now.

  Fal.
 In buckram?
  Poins.
 Down fell their hose.
 Why, thou clay-brain'd guts, thou
    knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch-
  Fal.
 What sayest thou to this?
  Poins.

    Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as
    blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.

  Poins.
 We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were
    masters of their wealth.
 Mark now how a plain tale shall put you  
    down.
 What trick hast thou now?
  Fal.
 Hostess, clap to
    the doors.
 Watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
 Content- and the argument shall be thy running away.
 What manner of man is he?
  Host.
 What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him
    his answer?
  Prince.
 By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so
    did you, Bardolph.
 Why, he hack'd it with his dagger, and said he would swear
    truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in
    fight, and persuaded us to do the like.

  Bard.
 Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
    bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it
    was the blood of true men.
 Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou
    ran'st away.
 Hot livers and cold purses.
 My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an
    eagle's talent in the waist; I could have crept into any
    alderman's thumb-ring.
 Owen, Owen- the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old
    Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that  
    runs a-horseback up a hill perpendicular-
  Prince.

  Prince.
 A-horseback, ye cuckoo! but afoot he will not budge a foot.
 I grant ye, upon instinct.
 Well, he is there too, and one
    Mordake, and a thousand bluecaps more.

  Fal.
 Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to
    thy father.
 This chair shall be my state, this dagger my
    sceptre, and this cushion my, crown.
 Thy state is taken for a join'd-stool, thy golden sceptre
    for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful
    bald crown.

  Fal.
 And here is my speech.
 Peace, good tickle-brain.
 For though the camomile, the more it is trodden
    on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the
    sooner it wears.

  Prince.
 A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful
    look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think,
    his age some fifty, or, by'r Lady, inclining to threescore; and
    now I remember me, his name is Falstaff.
 If that man should be
    lewdly, given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his
    looks.
 Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll
    play my father.

  Fal.

  Fal.

  Prince.
 That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,
    that old white-bearded Satan.
 I know thou dost.
 If sack and sugar be a fault,
    God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many
    an old host that I know is damn'd.

    Banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but for sweet Jack
    Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack
    Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being, as he is, old Jack
    Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company, banish not him thy
    Harry's company.
 Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!
    What's the matter?
  Host.
 The sheriff and all the watch are at the door.
 Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a
    counterfeit.
 And thou a natural coward without instinct.
 The rest walk, up above.

  Prince.
 As fat as butter.

  Sher.
 I will, my lord.
 There are two gentlemen
    Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
 I think it is good morrow, is it not?
  Sher.
 Falstaff! Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a
    horse.

ACT III.
 The Archdeacon's house.


Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, Owen Glendower.

  Hot.
 Cousin, of many men  
    I do not bear these crossings.
 I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
 Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.

  Hot.
 The Archdeacon hath divided it
    Into three limits very equally.
 A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;
    And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
    From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
    For there will be a world of water shed
    Upon the parting of your wives and you.

  Hot.

  Wor.
 I'll have it so.

  Hot.

  Hot.

    I'll haste the writer, and withal
    Break with your wives of your departure hence.
                    Exit.
 Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
  Hot.
 Sometimes he angers me
    With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,
    Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
    And of a dragon and a finless fish,
    A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
    A couching lion and a ramping cat,
    And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
    As puts me from my faith.

  Mort.
 Shall I tell you, cousin?
    He holds your temper in a high respect
    And curbs himself even of his natural scope
    When you come 'cross his humour.
  
  Wor.
 This is the deadly spite that angers me-
    My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
 Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
    Shall follow in your conduct speedily.

  Glend.

    I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,
    And that's a feeling disputation.

  Glend.

  Mort.
 Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down.

  Hot.
 Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
    And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.
 Lie still, ye thief, and hear the
    lady sing in Welsh.
 Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
  Hot.
 Then be still.
 What's that?
  Hot.
  
  Lady P.
 Not mine, in good sooth.
 An
    the indentures be drawn, I'll away within these two hours; and so
    come in when ye will.
 With all my heart.

London.

    I know not whether God will have it so,
    For some displeasing service I have done,
    That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
    He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
    But thou dost in thy passages of life
    Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
    For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
    To punish my mistreadings.
 So please your Majesty, I would I could
    Quit all offences with as clear excuse
    As well as I am doubtless I can purge
    Myself of many I am charged withal.

    Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,
    Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
    And art almost an alien to the hearts
    Of all the court and princes of my blood.

    The hope and expectation of thy time  
    Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
    Prophetically do forethink thy fall.

    So, when he had occasion to be seen,
    He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
    Heard, not regarded- seen, but with such eyes  
    As, sick and blunted with community,
    Afford no extraordinary gaze,
    Such as is bent on unlike majesty
    When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
    But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down,
    Slept in his face, and rend'red such aspect
    As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
    Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.

    And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
    For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
    With vile participation.

  Prince.
 Do not think so.

    And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
    Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me!
    I will redeem all this on Percy's head
    And, in the closing of some glorious day,
    Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
    When I will wear a garment all of blood,  
    And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
    Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.

    If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
    And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
    Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

    Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
    That Douglas and the English rebels met
    The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.

    A mighty and a fearful head they are,
    If promises be kept oil every hand,
    As ever off'red foul play in a state.
 Our meeting
    Is Bridgenorth; and, Harry, you shall march
    Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
    Our business valued, some twelve days hence
    Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
 Let's away.

    Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.


Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.

    Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking.

  Bard.
 No, I'll be sworn.
 I never see thy face but I
    think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he
    is in his robes, burning, burning.
' But thou art altogether given over,
    and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter
    darkness.
 O, thou art a
    perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast saved
    me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in
    the night betwixt tavern and tavern; but the sack that thou hast
    drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest
    chandler's in Europe.
 I have maintained that salamander of yours  
    with fire any time this two-and-thirty years.
 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
  Fal.


    How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you enquir'd yet who pick'd
    my pocket?
  Host.
 Who, I? No; I defy thee! God's light, I was never call'd so
    in mine own house before!
  Fal.

  Host.
 No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John.
 Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.
 What call you rich? Let them
    coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks.

    What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease
    in mine inn but I shall have my pocket pick'd? I have lost a
    seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.

  Host.

  Host.

  Prince.
 This house is turn'd bawdy house; they pick
    pockets.
 Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Three or four bonds of forty pound
    apiece and a seal-ring of my grandfather's.
 Go, you
    thing, go!
  Host.
 An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?
  Fal.

  Host.
 Thou or any man knows
    where to have me, thou knave, thou!  
  Prince.
 Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
  Fal.
 A thousand pound, Hal? A million! Thy love is worth a million;
    thou owest me thy love.
 Nay, my lord, he call'd you Jack and said he would cudgel
    you.
 Yea.
 if he said my ring was copper.
 I say, 'tis copper.
 Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
  Fal.
 Dost thou think
    I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my
    girdle break.
 You confess then, you pick'd my pocket?
  Prince.
 Thou seest I am pacified.
 For the robbery, lad- how is that answered?  
  Prince.

  Fal.

  Fal.
 They offend none but the virtuous.
 I laud them, I
    praise them.
 Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,
    To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
]
    Jack, meet me to-morrow in the Temple Hall
    At two o'clock in the afternoon.

    The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
    And either they or we must lower lie.

    O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!

    By God, I cannot flatter, I defy
    The tongues of soothers! but a braver place
    In my heart's love hath no man than yourself.

  Doug.


  Hot.
 These letters come from your father.
 He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
 I prithee tell me, doth he keep his bed?
  Mess.

  Hot.

    'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
 A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off.

    And yet, in faith, it is not! His present want
    Seems more than we shall find it.
 Faith, and so we should;  
    Where now remains a sweet reversion.

    We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
    Is to come in.

  Hot.
 A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
    If that the devil and mischance look big
    Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

    For well you know we of the off'ring side
    Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
    And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
    The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
 There is not such a word
    Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.


                 Enter Sir Richard Vernon.

    I saw young Harry with his beaver on
    His cushes on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,
    Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,  
    And vaulted with such ease into his seat
    As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
    To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
    And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
 Come, let me taste my horse,
    Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
    Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.

  Doug.

  Hot.

    Come, let us take a muster speedily.

  Doug.





Scene II.
 We'll to Sutton Co'fil'
    to-night.

  Bard.
 I have got in exchange of
    a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds.
 No eye hath seen such scarecrows.
 The King, I can tell
    you, looks for us all.
 Tut, never fear me.
 But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that
    come after?
  Fal.
 Mine, Hal, mine.
 I did never see such pitiful rascals.
 But, sirrah, make haste.
 He is, Sir John.





Scene III.

The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.


  Hot.
 Not a whit.

  Hot.

  Doug.
 Do me no slander, Douglas.

    Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle  
    Which of us fears.

  Doug.
 Content.
 I wonder much,
    Being men of such great leading as you are,
    That you foresee not what impediments
    Drag back our expedition.
 Certain horse
    Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up.

    For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.


              The trumpet sounds a parley.
 And God defend but still I should stand so,
    So long as out of limit and true rule
    You stand against anointed majesty!
    But to my charge.
 If that the King
    Have any way your good deserts forgot,  
    Which he confesseth to be manifold,
    He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed
    You shall have your desires with interest,
    And pardon absolute for yourself and these
    Herein misled by your suggestion.

    He presently, as greatness knows itself,
    Steps me a little higher than his vow
    Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
    Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
    And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
    Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
    That lie too heavy on the commonwealth;
    Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
    Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
    This seeming brow of justice, did he win
    The hearts of all that he did angle for;
    Proceeded further- cut me off the heads
    Of all the favourites that the absent King  
    In deputation left behind him here
    When he was personal in the Irish war.
 Shall I return this answer to the King?
  Hot.
 Not so, Sir Walter.

    Go to the King; and let there be impawn'd
    Some surety for a safe return again,
    And In the morning early shall mine uncle
    Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.
 I would you would accept of grace and love.
 The Archbishop's Palace.
 Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
    With winged haste to the Lord Marshal;
    This to my cousin Scroop; and all the rest
    To whom they are directed.
 If you knew
    How much they do import, you would make haste.
 My good lord,
    I guess their tenour.
 Like enough you do.
 Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
    There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
 No, Mortimer is not there.
 I must go write again
    To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

  Prince.
 These things, indeed, you have articulate,  
    Proclaim'd at market crosses, read in churches,
    To face the garment of rebellion
    With some fine colour that may please the eye
    Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
    Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
    Of hurlyburly innovation.

  Prince.
 Tell your nephew
    The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
    In praise of Henry Percy.
 By my hopes,
    This present enterprise set off his head,
    I do not think a braver gentleman,
    More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
    More daring or more bold, is now alive
    To grace this latter age with noble deeds.

    So tell your cousin, and bring me word
    What he will do.
  
    We will not now be troubled with reply.

  Fal.

Exit.
 'Tis not due yet.
 What is honour? A word.
 'Tis
    insensible then? Yea, to the dead.

  Wor.

    It is not possible, it cannot be
    The King should keep his word in loving us.

    Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
    Interpretation will misquote our looks,
    And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
    The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
 Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so.
 I told him gently of our grievances,
    Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
    By now forswearing that he is forsworn.


  Doug.
 O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
    And that no man might draw short breath to-day  
    But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
    How show'd his tasking? Seem'd it in contempt?
    No, by my soul.
 Never did I hear
    Of any prince so wild a libertine.
-
    O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
    To spend that shortness basely were too long
    If life did ride upon a dial's point,
    Still ending at the arrival of an hour.

    An if we live, we live to tread on kings;  
    If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
    Now for our consciences, the arms are fair,
    When the intent of bearing them is just.


                  Enter another Messenger.
 I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,
    For I profess not talking.
 Only this-
    Let each man do his best; and here draw I
    A sword whose temper I intend to stain
    With the best blood that I can meet withal
    In the adventure of this perilous day.
]




Scene III.
  Alarum to the battle.


  Blunt.
 Know then my name is Douglas,
    And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
    Because some tell me that thou art a king.
 The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
    Thy likeness; for instead of thee, King Harry,
    This sword hath ended him.
 So shall it thee,
    Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
 I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
    And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
    Lord Stafford's death.
 Here breathless lies the King.
 I know this face full well.
 The King hath many marching in his coats.

  Hot.
 Up and away!
    Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

                                                         Exeunt.

  
                 Alarum.
 Though I could scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot
    here.
 O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile.
 What, is it in the case?
  Fal.
 There's that will sack a city.
 I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter
    hath.


Alarum.

  Prince.
 Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
 Lead me, my lord, I do not need your help;
    And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
    The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
    Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
    And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
  John.
 Come, cousin Westmoreland,
    Our duty this way lies.
  
                          [Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland.
 By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster!
    I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.

  King.
 Another king? They grow like Hydra's heads.
 The King being in danger, enter Prince of Wales.

    It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,
    Who never promiseth but he means to pay.

                                     They fight.


  Hot.
 If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

    Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,
    Nor can one England brook a double reign
    Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

  Hot.
 I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,
    And all the budding honours on thy crest
    I'll crop to make a garland for my head.

  Hot.
 O, I could prophesy,
    But that the earthy and cold hand of death
    Lies on my tongue.
 No, Percy, thou art dust,
    And food for-                                        [Dies.
 How if he should
    counterfeit too, and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would
    prove the better counterfeit.
 [Enter Prince, and John of
                            Lancaster.

  
  Prince.
 I did; I saw him dead,
    Breathless and bleeding on the ground.

  Fal.
 If your father
    will do me any honour, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy
    himself.
 Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I
    grant you I was down, and out of breath, and so was he; but we
    rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury
    clock.

    Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back.
 He that rewards me, God
    reward him! If I do grow great, I'll grow less; for I'll purge,
    and leave sack, and live cleanly, as a nobleman should do.


The trumpets sound.
 [Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
Earl of Westmoreland, with Worcester and Vernon prisoners.
 Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.

    Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
    Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
    And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
    Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?
    Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
    A noble earl, and many a creature else
    Had been alive this hour,
    If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
    Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

  Wor.
 What I have done my safety urg'd me to;
    And I embrace this fortune patiently,
    Since not to be avoided it fails on me.

    His valour shown upon our crests today
    Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,
    Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

    Rebellion in this laud shall lose his sway,
    Meeting the check of such another day;
    And since this business so fair is done,
    Let us not leave till all our own be won.

                                                         Exeunt.
 But what need I thus
    My well-known body to anatomize
    Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
    I run before King Harry's victory,
    Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury,
    Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
    Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
    Even with the rebels' blood.
 From Rumour's tongues
    They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.
 His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard.
 Good, an God will!
  LORD BARDOLPH.
 My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
    And he is furnish'd with no certainties
    More than he haply may retail from me.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
    With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
    Out-rode me.

    He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
    And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
 My lord, I'll tell you what:
    If my young lord your son have not the day,
    Upon mine honour, for a silken point
    I'll give my barony.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 How doth my son and brother?
    Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
    Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
 The sum of all
    Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out
    A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
    Under the conduct of young Lancaster  
    And Westmoreland.
 This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
 Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
 We all that are engaged to this loss
    Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
    That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
    And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
    Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd;
    And since we are o'erset, venture again.

    My lord your son had only but the corpse,
    But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
    For that same word 'rebellion' did divide  
    The action of their bodies from their souls;
    And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
    As men drink potions; that their weapons only
    Seem'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls
    This word 'rebellion'- it had froze them up,
    As fish are in a pond.
 I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
    This present grief had wip'd it from my mind.

    Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed-  
    Never so few, and never yet more need.
                Exeunt




SCENE II.

London.
 A street

Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler

  FALSTAFF.
 I will sooner have a beard grow in the
    palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek; and yet he
    will not stick to say his face is a face-royal.
 He would not take his band and yours; he liked not the
    security.
 Let him be damn'd, like the Glutton; pray God his tongue
    be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascal-yea-forsooth knave, to
    bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The
    whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
    bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with
    them in honest taking-up, then they must stand upon security.

    Well, he may sleep in security; for he hath the horn of
    abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and
    yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
 Wait close; I will not see him.
 What's he that goes there?
  SERVANT.
 He that was in question for the robb'ry?
  SERVANT.
 What, to York? Call him back again.
 Sir John Falstaff!
  FALSTAFF.

  SERVANT.
 I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your
    soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your
    throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man.
  
  FALSTAFF.
 I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that which
    grows to me! If thou get'st any leave of me, hang me; if thou
    tak'st leave, thou wert better be hang'd.
 I heard say your lordship
    was sick; I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice.
 Your
    lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack
    of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I most
    humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
    health.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  FALSTAFF.
 It hath it original from much grief, from study, and
    perturbation of the brain.
 I think you are fall'n into the disease, for you
    hear not what I say to you.

  FALSTAFF.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 To punish you by the heels would amend the attention
    of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.

  FALSTAFF.
 I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.
 As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws
    of this land-service, I did not come.
 He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.
 Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound.

  FALSTAFF.
 What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
    out.
 There is not a white hair in your face but should
    have his effect of gravity.
 And yet in some
    respects, I grant, I cannot go- I cannot tell.
 You that are old consider not the capacities of us  
    that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the
    bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our
    youth, must confess, are wags too.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  FALSTAFF.
 There is not a dangerous action can peep
    out his head but I am thrust upon it.
 Well, I cannot last ever;
    but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they
    have a good thing, to make it too common.
 I were better to be
    eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
    perpetual motion.
 Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your  
    expedition!
  FALSTAFF.
 Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me
    forth?
  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 Commend me to my cousin
    Westmoreland.
 Sir?
  FALSTAFF.
 Seven groats and two pence.

  FALSTAFF.
 Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster; this
    to the Prince; this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
    Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I
    perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin.

York.
 The ARCHBISHOP'S palace

Enter the ARCHBISHOP, THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL, LORD HASTINGS,
and LORD BARDOLPH

  ARCHBISHOP.
 Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
    And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
    Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes-
    And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
  MOWBRAY.
 I well allow the occasion of our amis;
    But gladly would be better satisfied
    How, in our means, we should advance ourselves
    To look with forehead bold and big enough
    Upon the power and puissance of the King.

  HASTINGS.
 Our present musters grow upon the file
    To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
    And our supplies live largely in the hope
    Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
    With an incensed fire of injuries.

  LORD BARDOLPH.
 But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
    To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.

  HASTINGS.
 Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
  HASTINGS.
 Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
  HASTINGS.
 We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.

London.
 Cut me off the villian's
    head.

  FALSTAFF.
 I beseech you, stand to me.
 It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all- all I
    have.
 He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put all my
    substance into that fat belly of his.

  FALSTAFF.
 She hath been in
    good case, and, the truth is, poverty hath distracted her.
 You have, as it appears to me, practis'd upon the
    easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses
    both in purse and in person.
 Yea, in truth, my lord.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply.
 You
    call honourable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make
    curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous.
 No, my lord, my humble
    duty rememb'red, I will not be your suitor.
 You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in
    th' effect of your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman.
 As I am a gentleman! Come, no more words of it.
 Come, and 'twere not for thy humours, there's not
    a better wench in England.

    I hope you'll come to supper.
 you'll pay me all together?
  FALSTAFF.
 I must wait upon my good lord here, I thank you, good Sir
    John.
 Now, the Lord lighten thee! Thou art a great fool.
 Before God, I am exceeding weary.
 Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have
    attach'd one of so high blood.
 What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or
    to know thy face to-morrow, or to take note how many pair of silk
    stockings thou hast- viz.
 How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you
    should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would
    do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?
  PRINCE.
 Very hardly upon such a subject.
 By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book
    as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency: let the end
    try the man.
 And what accites your most worshipful
    thought to think so?
  POINS.
 Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to
    Falstaff.
 By the mass, here comes  
    Bardolph.


                         Enter BARDOLPH and PAGE

  PRINCE.
 And the boy that I gave Falstaff.
 'A had him from me
    Christian; and look if the fat villain have not transform'd him
    ape.
 Has not the boy profited?
  BARDOLPH.
 A crown's worth of good interpretation.
 O that this blossom could be kept from cankers!
    Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.

  PRINCE.
 Well, my lord.
 Deliver'd with good respect.
 And how doth the martlemas,
    your master?
  BARDOLPH.

  POINS.
  [Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight'- Every man must know that  
    as oft as he has occasion to name himself, even like those that
    are kin to the King; for they never prick their finger but they
    say 'There's some of the King's blood spilt.
 Peace!  [Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
    brevity.
'-
  POINS.
  [Reads]  'I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I
    leave thee.
'
  POINS.
 That's to make him eat twenty of his words.
 But do you use
    me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?
  POINS.
 Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
  BARDOLPH.

  PRINCE.
 A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
 There's for your silence.

  BARDOLPH.
            Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE
    This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.

  POINS.
 O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
    The time was, father, that you broke your word,
    When you were more endear'd to it than now;
    When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
    Threw many a northward look to see his father
    Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.

    Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
    There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
 He was indeed the glass
    Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.
 So you left him.

    Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
    To hold your honour more precise and nice
    With others than with him! Let them alone.

    The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.
 Beshrew your heart,
    Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
    With new lamenting ancient oversights.
 So did your son;
    He was so suff'red; so came I a widow;
    And never shall have length of life enough
    To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
    That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
    For recordation to my noble husband.

    I will resolve for Scotland.
 There am I,
    Till time and vantage crave my company.
               Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon; and
    they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John must  
    not know of it.
 By the mass, here will be old uds; it will be an
    excellent stratagem.

  SECOND DRAWER.
 I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent
    good temperality.
 Better than I was- hem.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make
    the diseases, Doll.

  DOLL.

  FALSTAFF.
 You are both, i' good truth, as
    rheumatic as two dry toasts; you cannot one bear with another's
    confirmities.
 If he swagger, let him not come here.
 There comes no  
    swaggerers here; I have not liv'd all this while to have
    swaggering now.
 Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.

  HOSTESS.
 I was before Master Tisick, the
    debuty, t' other day; and, as he said to me- 'twas no longer ago
    than Wednesday last, i' good faith!- 'Neighbour Quickly,' says
    he- Master Dumbe, our minister, was by then- 'Neighbour Quickly,'
    says he 'receive those that are civil, for' said he 'you are in
    an ill name.
' There comes none here.
 Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my house,
    nor no cheater; but I do not love swaggering, by my troth.
 So you do, hostess.

  HOSTESS.

  PISTOL.
 She is pistol-proof, sir; you shall not hardly offend
    her.
 Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets.
 I'll drink no
    more than will do me good, for no man's pleasure, I.

  DOLL.
 Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away! By this
    wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps, an you play the
    saucy cuttle with me.

  FALSTAFF.
 Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

  PAGE.
 I'll see her damn'd first; to Pluto's damn'd lake, by this
    hand, to th' infernal deep, with Erebus and tortures vile also.
 Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i' faith; I
    beseek you now, aggravate your choler.

  BARDOLPH.

  PISTOL.
 Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren
    here?
  HOSTESS.

    'Si fortune me tormente sperato me contento.

  PISTOL.
 Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Galloway nags?
  FALSTAFF.
 Here's goodly stuff toward!
  FALSTAFF.
 Get you down stairs.
 Are you not hurt i' th' groin? Methought 'a made a shrewd
    thrust at your belly.
 Ah, villain!
  FALSTAFF.
 A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
 The music is come, sir.
 A rascal
    bragging slave! The rogue fled from me like quick-silver.
 I' faith, and thou follow'dst him like a church.
 Let's beat him before his whore.

  PRINCE.
 Thou dost give me flattering busses.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 Anon, anon, sir.

                                    [Leaning his band upon DOLL]
  DOLL.

  FALSTAFF.
 No abuse, Ned, i' th' world; honest Ned, none.
 No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys,
    none.

  FALSTAFF.
 The fiend hath prick'd down Bardolph irrecoverable; and  
    his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he doth nothing but
    roast malt-worms.
 For the women?
  FALSTAFF.
 For one of them- she's in hell already, and burns poor
    souls.

  FALSTAFF.

    Marry, there is another indictment upon thee for suffering flesh
    to be eaten in thy house, contrary to the law; for the which I
    think thou wilt howl.
 What says your Grace?
  FALSTAFF.
 His Grace says that which his flesh rebels against.

  PRINCE.
 If my heart be not ready to burst!
    Well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.
  [ Within]  Mistress Tearsheet!
  HOSTESS.
- Yea, will you come, Doll?           Exeunt

 The palace

Enter the KING in his nightgown, with a page

  KING.
        Exit page
    How many thousands of my poorest subjects
    Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
    Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee,
    That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down,
    And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
    Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
    Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
    And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
    Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,
    Under the canopies of costly state,
    And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
    O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
    In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch
    A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
    Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
    Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
    In cradle of the rude imperious surge,
    And in the visitation of the winds,
    Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
    Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
    With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds,
    That with the hurly death itself awakes?
    Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
    To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;
    And in the calmest and most stillest night,
    With all appliances and means to boot,
    Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!
    Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

    Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?
  WARWICK.
 Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
    How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,
    And with what danger, near the heart of it.
 It is but as a body yet distempered;
    Which to his former strength may be restored
    With good advice and little medicine.
 But which of you was by-
    [To WARWICK]  You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember-
    When Richard, with his eye brim full of tears,
    Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,
    Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?
    'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
    My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'-
    Though then, God knows, I had no such intent
    But that necessity so bow'd the state
    That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss-  
    'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
    'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
    Shall break into corruption' so went on,
    Foretelling this same time's condition
    And the division of our amity.

    To comfort you the more, I have receiv'd
    A certain instance that Glendower is dead.

    And, were these inward wars once out of hand,
    We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.

Gloucestershire.
 An early stirrer, by the rood! And how doth my
    good cousin Silence?
  SILENCE.

  SILENCE.
 Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, boy,
    and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

  SHALLOW.

  SHALLOW.

  BARDOLPH.

    How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?
  BARDOLPH.

  SHALLOW.
 Pardon, sir; I have heard the word.
 Give me
    your good hand, give me your worship's good hand.

    Master Surecard, as I think?
  SHALLOW.
 What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow; young,
    strong, and of good friends.
  
  FALSTAFF.
 I was prick'd well enough before, an you could have let me
    alone.
 My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry
    and her drudgery.

  FALSTAFF.
 Mouldy, it is time
    you were spent.

  MOULDY.
 Spent!
  SHALLOW.
 Here, sir.
 My mother's son, sir.
 Yea, sir.
 Prick him no more.

  SHALLOW.
 Here, sir.
 What trade art thou, Feeble?
  FEEBLE.
 A woman's tailor, sir.
 Shall I prick him, sir?
  FALSTAFF.
 Well said, good woman's tailor! well said, courageous
    Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most
    magnanimous mouse.

  FALSTAFF.
 It shall suffice, sir.

  BULLCALF.
 O Lord! good my lord captain-
  FALSTAFF.
 A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with
    ringing in the King's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.

  FALSTAFF.
 We will have
    away thy cold; and I will take such order that thy friends shall
    ring for thee.
 Is here all?
  SHALLOW.
 Ha, 'twas a merry night.
 And is Jane Nightwork alive?  
  FALSTAFF.
 Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this
    knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
  FALSTAFF.
 We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.

  SHALLOW.
 Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to
    dinner; come, let's to dinner.

  MOULDY.
 An't be my destiny, so;
    an't be not, so.
 No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, let
    it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the
    next.

  BARDOLPH.
 Well said; th'art a good fellow.
 Go to; well.

  SHALLOW.
 Marry, then- Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.
 Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man?
    Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big
    assemblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master Shallow.

  BARDOLPH.
 So- very well.
 Well said, i' faith, Wart; th'art a good scab.

    Hold, there's a tester for thee.
 Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.
 'A came ever in the rearward of the
    fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that
    he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or
    his good-nights.
 And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire,
    and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn
    brother to him; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in
    the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the
    marshal's men.

Yorkshire.

  ARCHBISHOP.


                          Enter A MESSENGER

  HASTINGS.
 If that rebellion
    Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
    Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
    And countenanc'd by boys and beggary-
    I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd
    In his true, native, and most proper shape,
    You, reverend father, and these noble lords,
    Had not been here to dress the ugly form
    Of base and bloody insurrection
    With your fair honours.

    We see which way the stream of time doth run
    And are enforc'd from our most quiet there
    By the rough torrent of occasion;
    And have the summary of all our griefs,
    When time shall serve, to show in articles;
    Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,
    And might by no suit gain our audience:
    When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,
    We are denied access unto his person,
    Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
 My brother general, the commonwealth,
    To brother horn an household cruelty,
    I make my quarrel in particular.
 There is no need of any such redress;
    Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

    The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
    In England the most valiant gentleman.

    But this is mere digression from my purpose.

    This offer comes from mercy, not from fear;
    For, lo! within a ken our army lies-
    Upon mine honour, all too confident
    To give admittance to a thought of fear.

  WESTMORELAND.

  HASTINGS.
 For full well he knows
    He cannot so precisely weed this land  
    As his misdoubts present occasion:
    His foes are so enrooted with his friends
    That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
    He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.

  ARCHBISHOP.
 Before, and greet his Grace.
 My lord, we come.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.

Another part of the forest

Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards, the ARCHBISHOP,
HASTINGS, and others; from the other side, PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER,
WESTMORELAND, OFFICERS, and others

  PRINCE JOHN.
 You are well encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray.

  ARCHBISHOP.

  HASTINGS.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 I like them all and do allow them well;
    And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
    My father's purposes have been mistook;
    And some about him have too lavishly
    Wrested his meaning and authority.
 If this may please you,
    Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
    As we will ours; and here, between the armies,
    Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
    That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
    Of our restored love and amity.

  WESTMORELAND.

  WESTMORELAND.
 Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.

  MOWBRAY.

  ARCHBISHOP.
 They know their duties.
 Is this proceeding just and honourable?
  WESTMORELAND.
 Is your assembly so?
  ARCHBISHOP.

    God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.

  FALSTAFF.
 Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
  FALSTAFF.
  
    An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most
    active fellow in Europe.
 The heat is past; follow no further now.

  FALSTAFF.
 I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I never
    knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour.

  FALSTAFF.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 It is, my lord.
 And a famous true subject took him.

  FALSTAFF.
 I know not how they sold themselves; but thou, like a
    kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I thank thee for
    thee.
 Fare you well, Falstaff.
 If I had a thousand sons,  
    the first humane principle I would teach them should be to
    forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.

Westminster.

    Our navy is address'd, our power connected,
    Our substitutes in absence well invested,
    And everything lies level to our wish.
 Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
    Shall soon enjoy.

  KING.
 Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;  
    And he, the noble image of my youth,
    Is overspread with them; therefore my grief
    Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.

    The Prince but studies his companions
    Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
    'Tis needful that the most immodest word
    Be look'd upon and learnt; which once attain'd,
    Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
    But to be known and hated.
 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
    In the dead carrion.
 Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
    Added to that that am to deliver!
    Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand.

    The manner how this action hath been borne
    Here at more leisure may your Highness read,
    With every course in his particular.
 O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
    Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
    The lifting up of day.

    I should rejoice now at this happy news;
    And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.

    Stand from him, give him air; he'll straight be well.
 No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.
 The people fear me; for they do observe
    Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature.

    The seasons change their manners, as the year
    Had found some months asleep, and leapt them over.

  WARWICK.
 Softly, pray.
                Exeunt




SCENE V.

  KING.

  CLARENCE.

  WARWICK.
 Sweet Prince, speak low;
    The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.

  CLARENCE.
 Will't please your Grace to go along with us?
  PRINCE.
  
    Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
    Perforce must move.
 What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?
  KING.

  KING.

  KING.
 I never thought to hear you speak again.

    Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity
    Is held from falling with so weak a wind
    That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.

    Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not,
    And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.

    Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
    Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
    To stab at half an hour of my life.

    Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
    Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;
    Only compound me with forgotten dust;
    Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
 All you sage counsellors, hence.

    Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
    Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
    The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
    Be happy, he will trouble you no more.
 O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
    The moist impediments unto my speech,
    I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke  
    Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
    The course of it so far.
 Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.

    It hath been prophesied to me many years,  
    I should not die but in Jerusalem;
    Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land.

ACT V.
 By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.

  SHALLOW.
 I will not excuse you; you shall not be excus'd; excuses
    shall not be admitted; there is no excuse shall serve; you shall
    not be excus'd.
 Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of
    short-legg'd hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny
    kickshaws, tell William cook.
 Use his men well, Davy; for they
    are arrant knaves and will backbite.
 Well conceited, Davy- about thy business, Davy.
 The knave is mine honest friend, sir;
    therefore, I beseech you, let him be countenanc'd.

  SHALLOW.
 I am glad to see your worship.
 I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph.
 Their spirits are so married in
    conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
    together in consent, like so many wild geese.
 I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow
    to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six
    fashions, which is four terms, or two actions; and 'a shall laugh
    without intervallums.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 Good morrow, cousin.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
    Which swims against your stream of quality.

  WARWICK.
 Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!
  KING.

    This is the English, not the Turkish court;
    Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,  
    But Harry Harry.
 We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.

  KING.
 There is my hand.

Gloucestershire.
 SHALLOW'S orchard

Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, SILENCE, BARDOLPH, the PAGE, and DAVY

  SHALLOW.
 Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we
    will eat a last year's pippin of mine own graffing, with a dish
    of caraways, and so forth.
 This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your
    serving-man and your husband.

  SHALLOW.
 Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.
  [Singing]

         Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;
         For women are shrews, both short and tall;
         'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
           And welcome merry Shrove-tide.


  FALSTAFF.
 Well said, Master Silence.

  FALSTAFF.
 Health and long life to you, Master Silence!  
  SILENCE.
  [Singing]

         Fill the cup, and let it come,
         I'll pledge you a mile to th' bottom.
 I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all
    the cabileros about London.
 I hope to see London once ere I die.

  BARDOLPH.
 The knave will stick by
    thee, I can assure thee that.
 'A will not out, 'a; 'tis true
    bred.

  BARDOLPH.

  SHALLOW.
 Lack nothing; be merry.

  SILENCE.
 Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
 An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come from the
    court with news.
 Sir John, God save you!
  FALSTAFF.
 What wind blew you hither, Pistol?
  PISTOL.

  FALSTAFF.
 A foutra for the world and worldlings base!
    I speak of Africa and golden joys.
 Harry the Fourth.

  PISTOL.
 A foutra for thine office!
    Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King;
    Harry the Fifth's the man.
 I speak the truth.
 Master Robert Shallow,
    choose what office thou wilt in the land, 'tis thine.
 Pistol, I  
    will double-charge thee with dignities.

  BARDOLPH.
 Carry Master Silence to bed.
 Get on thy
    boots; we'll ride all night.
 Boot, boot, Master Shallow!
    I know the young King is sick for me.
 Let us take any man's
    horses: the laws of England are at my commandment.

  DOLL.
 If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;
    you have but eleven now.

  FIRST BEADLE.

  DOLL.
  [To SHALLOW]  O, if
    I had had to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the
    thousand pound I borrowed of you.
 But 'tis no matter; this poor
    show doth better; this doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
 It doth so.

  FALSTAFF.
 It is best, certain.
 There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
 My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!
  KING.
 I know thee not, old man.
 Fall to thy prayers.

    How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
    I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,
    So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;  
    But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.

    When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
    The tutor and the feeder of my riots.
 Be it your charge, my lord,  
    To see perform'd the tenour of our word.

    Set on.
 Fear not your advancements; I will be the
    man yet that shall make you great.

  FALSTAFF.
 I shall be sent for soon at night.

  FALSTAFF.
 I cannot now speak.

           Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
  PRINCE JOHN.
 The King hath call'd his parliament, my lord.
 I heard a bird so sing,
    Whose music, to my thinking, pleas'd the King.

If you look for a good speech now, you undo me; for what I have to say
is of mine own making; and what, indeed, I should say will, I doubt,
prove mine own marring.
 But a good conscience will make any possible
satisfaction, and so would I.
 All the gentlewomen here have forgiven
me.

 The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
    For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
    When the man dies, let the inheritance
    Descend unto the daughter.

    You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
    The blood and courage that renowned them
    Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
    Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
    Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

  CANTERBURY.

  KING HENRY.
 We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
    But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
    Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
    For you shall read that my great-grandfather
    Never went with his forces into France
    But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
    Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
    With ample and brim fulness of his force,  
    Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
    Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns;
    That England, being empty of defence,
    Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood.

  CANTERBURY.
 But there's a saying, very old and true:

          'If that you will France win,
          Then with Scotland first begin.

    They have a king, and officers of sorts,
    Where some like magistrates correct at home;
    Others like merchants venture trade abroad;
    Others like soldiers, armed in their stings,
    Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
    Which pillage they with merry march bring home
    To the tent-royal of their emperor;
    Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
    The singing masons building roofs of gold,
    The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
    The poor mechanic porters crowding in
    Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
    The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum,
    Delivering o'er to executors pale
    The lazy yawning drone.

    Divide your happy England into four;
    Whereof take you one quarter into France,
    And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.

    If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
    Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
    Let us be worried, and our nation lose
    The name of hardiness and policy.

                                          Exeunt some attendants
    Now are we well resolv'd; and, by God's help
    And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
    France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
    Or break it all to pieces; or there we'll sit,
    Ruling in large and ample empery  
    O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
    Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
    Tombless, with no remembrance over them.

  AMBASSADOR.

    Convey them with safe conduct.
 This was a merry message.
 We hope to make the sender blush at it.

    Therefore let our proportions for these wars
    Be soon collected, and all things thought upon
    That may with reasonable swiftness ad
    More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
    We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
         Exeunt

ACT II.
 PROLOGUE.
 Now all the youth of England are on fire,
    And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
    Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
    Reigns solely in the breast of every man;
    They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
    Following the mirror of all Christian kings
    With winged heels, as English Mercuries.

    O England! model to thy inward greatness,
    Like little body with a mighty heart,
    What mightst thou do that honour would thee do,  
    Were all thy children kind and natural!
    But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
    A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
    With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men-
    One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
    Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
    Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
    Have, for the gilt of France- O guilt indeed!-
    Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
    And by their hands this grace of kings must die-
    If hell and treason hold their promises,
    Ere he take ship for France- and in Southampton.

    The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,
    The King is set from London, and the scene
    Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
    There is the play-house now, there must you sit,
    And thence to France shall we convey you safe
    And bring you back, charming the narrow seas  
    To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
    We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
 Before the Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap

Enter CORPORAL NYM and LIEUTENANT BARDOLPH

  BARDOLPH.
 Well met, Corporal Nym.
 For my part, I care not; I say little, but when time shall
    serve, there shall be smiles- but that shall be as it may.
  
  NYM.
 It must be as it may; though patience be a
    tired mare, yet she will plod.
 Base tike, call'st thou me host?
    Now by this hand, I swear I scorn the term;
    Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
 No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a
    dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of
    their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house
    straight.
 Good Lieutenant, good Corporal, offer nothing here.
 An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.

  PISTOL.
 Away, you rogue.

  PISTOL.

                                           [PISTOL and Nym draw]
  BARDOLPH.
 Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.

    Is not this just? For I shall sutler be
    Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.

  NYM.


                       Re-enter HOSTESS

  HOSTESS.
 Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
    His heart is fracted and corroborate.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.

  EXETER.

    My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,  
    And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.

    Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us
    Will cut their passage through the force of France,
    Doing the execution and the act
    For which we have in head assembled them?
  SCROOP.
 I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
    We carry not a heart with us from hence
    That grows not in a fair consent with ours;
    Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
    Success and conquest to attend on us.

  CAMBRIDGE.
 There's not, I think, a subject
    That sits in heart-grief and uneasines
    Under the sweet shade of your government.
 We judge no less.
 Uncle of Exeter,
    Enlarge the man committed yesterday
    That rail'd against our person.
 That's mercy, but too much security.

  GREY.
 Sir,
    You show great mercy if you give him life,
    After the taste of much correction.

  GREY.
 To which we all appeal.

    If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
    Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
    He might return to vasty Tartar back,
    And tell the legions 'I can never win
    A soul so easy as that Englishman's.
'
    O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
    The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
    Why, so didst thou.
 I will weep for thee;
    For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
    Another fall of man.

    I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey,
      knight, of Northumberland.

  CAMBRIDGE.

  GREY.

  KING HENRY.
 For Falstaff he is dead,
    And we must earn therefore.
 'How now, Sir John!' quoth I 'What, man, be o' good
    cheer.
 Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate.

  HOSTESS.

  BOY.
  
  NYM.

  PISTOL.

    Look to my chattles and my moveables;
    Let senses rule.

    Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.

  BARDOLPH.
 Let housewifery appear; keep close, I thee command.

France.

    The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
    And he is bred out of that bloody strain
    That haunted us in our familiar paths.

                              Exeunt MESSENGER and certain LORDS
    You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.
 Turn head and stop pursuit; for coward dogs  
    Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
    Runs far before them.

    Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
    As self-neglecting.
 That you may know
    'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
    Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
    Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd,
    He sends you this most memorable line,       [Gives a paper]
    In every branch truly demonstrative;
    Willing you overlook this pedigree.
 Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
    Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
 What to him from England?
  EXETER.

    Thus says my king: an if your father's Highness
    Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
    Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,
    He'll call you to so hot an answer of it
    That caves and womby vaultages of France  
    Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
    In second accent of his ordinance.

  DAUPHIN.
 To that end,
    As matching to his youth and vanity,
    I did present him with the Paris balls.
      Flourish.

    Play with your fancies; and in them behold
    Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;

SCENE I.
 Before Harfleur

Alarum.
 Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
    Or close the wall up with our English dead.

    Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide;
    Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit  
    To his full height.

  PISTOL.
 The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound:

        Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
                    And sword and shield
                    In bloody field
                 Doth win immortal fame.
 Would I were in an alehouse in London! I wouid give all my
    fame for a pot of ale and safety.
 And I:

               If wishes would prevail with me,
               My purpose should not fail with me,
                   But thither would I hie.
 Up to the breach, you dogs!
    Avaunt, you cullions!                 [Driving them forward]
  PISTOL.
 These be good humours.
 Your honour wins bad humours.
 For Nym,
    he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and
    therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought
    a coward; but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
    deeds; for 'a never broke any man's head but his own, and that
    was against a post when he was drunk.

  FLUELLEN.
 Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with
    him.
 By Cheshu,
    he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the
    world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.
 O,
    tish ill done, tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!
  FLUELLEN.
 It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath; and I sall
    quit you with gud leve, as I may pick occasion; that sall I,
    marry.
 It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me.

  JAMY.

  FLUELLEN.
 What ish my nation? Who talks
    of my nation?
  FLUELLEN.
 Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant,
    Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me
    with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, look
    you; being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
    war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other
    particularities.

  MACMORRIS.

  GOWER.

    What is it then to me if impious war,
    Array'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends,
    Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats  
    Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
    What is't to me when you yourselves are cause,
    If your pure maidens fall into the hand
    Of hot and forcing violation?
    What rein can hold licentious wickednes
    When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
    We may as bootless spend our vain command
    Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil,
    As send precepts to the Leviathan
    To come ashore.

    What say you? Will you yield, and this avoid?
    Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
  GOVERNOR.
 Open your gates.

Rouen.
 Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le
    langage.
 Les doigts? Je pense qu'ils sont appeles de fingres;
    oui, de fingres.

  ALICE.
 C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglais.
 Dites-moi l'Anglais pour le bras.

  ALICE.
 D'elbow.
 De nick.
 Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots
    aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
 N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
  KATHERINE.
 Ainsi dis-je; d'elbow, de nick, et de sin.

  KATHERINE.

SCENE V.

The FRENCH KING'S palace

Enter the KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, DUKE OF BRITAINE,
the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, and others

  FRENCH KING.
 'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

  CONSTABLE.

  BRITAINE.

    Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
 How now, Captain Fluellen! Come you from the bridge?
  FLUELLEN.

  GOWER.
 Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
    And of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate
    And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
    That goddess blind,
    That stands upon the rolling restless stone-
  FLUELLEN.

  PISTOL.
 Why then, rejoice therefore.
 Certainly, Aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at;
    for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to
    use his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline
    ought to be used.

  FLUELLEN.
 I'll assure you, 'a utt'red as prave words at the pridge
    as you shall see in a summer's day.
 Why, 'tis a gull a fool a rogue, that now and then goes to
    the wars to grace himself, at his return into London, under the
    form of a soldier.
 And such fellows are perfect in the great
    commanders' names; and they will learn you by rote where services
    were done- at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a
    convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what
    terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in the
    phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what
    a beard of the General's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will
    do among foaming bottles and ale-wash'd wits is wonderful to be
    thought on.


         Drum and colours.
 Enter the KING and his poor soldiers,
                          and GLOUCESTER

    God pless your Majesty!
  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 To this add
    defiance; and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
    followers, whose condemnation is pronounc'd.
 So far my king and
    master; so much my office.
 Montjoy.

    Go, bid thy master well advise himself.

    If we may pass, we will; if we be hind'red,
    We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
    Discolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.

  KING HENRY.
 Will it never be morning?
  DAUPHIN.
 He trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it;
    the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of  
    Hermes.

  DAUPHIN.
 It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
    bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
 I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder  
    of nature'-
  ORLEANS.

  DAUPHIN.
 Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser;
    for my horse is my mistress.
 Your mistress bears well.
 Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
    shook your back.
 O, then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode like a
    kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your strait
    strossers.

  CONSTABLE.

  CONSTABLE.
 Ev'n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as
    well were some of your brags dismounted.
 Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it
    never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and my way shall be
    paved with English faces.

  CONSTABLE.

  DAUPHIN.

  CONSTABLE.

  ORLEANS.

  CONSTABLE.
 What's he?
  CONSTABLE.

    'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.

  CONSTABLE.
'
  CONSTABLE.
 Who hath measur'd the ground?
  MESSENGER.
 The Lord Grandpre.
 What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
    England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers so far out of his
    knowledge!
  CONSTABLE.
 If the English had any apprehension, they would run
    away.

  ORLEANS.
 Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian
    bear, and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples! You may as
    well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
    lip of a lion.
 Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
 It is now two o'clock; but let me see- by ten
    We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
              Exeunt

    Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
    Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
    Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
    Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents
    The armourers accomplishing the knights,
    With busy hammers closing rivets up,
    Give dreadful note of preparation.
 O, now, who will behold
    The royal captain of this ruin'd band
    Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
    Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
    For forth he goes and visits all his host;
    Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,
    And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.

    Besides, they are our outward consciences
    And preachers to us all, admonishing
    That we should dress us fairly for our end.

    Do my good morrow to them, and anon
    Desire them all to my pavilion.

  KING HENRY.
 Though it appear a little out of fashion,
    There is much care and valour in this Welshman.
 Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks
    yonder?
  BATES.
 A friend.
 I pray
    you, what thinks he of our estate?
  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.

  BATES.
 If his cause be wrong, our  
    obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.
 Every subject's
    duty is the King's; but every subject's soul is his own.

  BATES.
 I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'd.
 Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our
    throats are cut he may be ransom'd, and we ne'er the wiser.
 If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
  
  WILLIAMS.

    Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls,
    Our debts, our careful wives,
    Our children, and our sins, lay on the King!
    We must bear all.

    What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
    But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
    And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
    Thinks thou the fiery fever will go out
    With titles blown from adulation?
    Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
    Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
    Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
    That play'st so subtly with a king's repose.

    The slave, a member of the country's peace,
    Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
    What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace

 More will I do;

    Since that my penitence comes after all,
    Imploring pardon.
 My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;
    I know thy errand, I will go with thee;
    The day, my friends, and all things, stay for me.
 O brave spirit!
  DAUPHIN.
 Rien puis? L'air et le feu.
 Ciel! cousin Orleans.

    There is not work enough for all our hands;
    Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
    To give each naked curtle-axe a stain
    That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
    And sheathe for lack of sport.
 Let us but blow on them,
    The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
 Then let the trumpets sound
    The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
    For our approach shall so much dare the field
    That England shall couch down in fear and yield.


                        Enter GRANDPRE

  GRANDPRE.

    Description cannot suit itself in words
    To demonstrate the life of such a battle
    In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
 I stay but for my guidon.
 What's he that wishes so?
    My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin;
    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
    To do our country loss; and if to live,
    The fewer men, the greater share of honour.

    By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
    Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
    It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
    Such outward things dwell not in my desires.

    No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.

  SALISBURY.
 The Constable of France.

    Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
    The man that once did sell the lion's skin
    While the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him.

    Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable
    We are but warriors for the working-day;
    Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
    With rainy marching in the painful field;
    There's not a piece of feather in our host-
    Good argument, I hope, we will not fly-
    And time hath worn us into slovenry.
 I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.
 Yield, cur!

 Je pense que vous etes le gentilhomme de bonne
    qualite.
 Cality! Calen o custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
    What is thy name? Discuss.
 O Seigneur Dieu!
  PISTOL.
 O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman.
 O, prenez misericorde; ayez pitie de moi!
  PISTOL.
 Say'st thou me so? Is that a ton of moys?
    Come hither, boy; ask me this slave in French
    What is his name.
 Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret him-
   discuss the same in French unto him.

  PISTOL.

  PISTOL.

  PISTOL.
 Tell him my fury shall abate, and I
    The crowns will take.

  FRENCH SOLDIER.

  FRENCH SOLDIER.
 Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et
    je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les mains d'un
    chevalier, je pense, le plus brave, vaillant, et tres distingue
    seigneur d'Angleterre.

  PISTOL.

  PISTOL.

    Follow me.
 Why, an our ranks are broke.
       Exeunt




SCENE VI.

    Suffolk first died; and York, all haggled over,
    Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
    And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
    That bloodily did yawn upon his face,
    He cries aloud 'Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.
'
    Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up;
    He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
    And, with a feeble grip, says 'Dear my lord,
    Commend my service to my sovereign.
'
    So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck
    He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
    And so, espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
    A testament of noble-ending love.

    The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd
    Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
    But I had not so much of man in me,
    And all my mother came into mine eyes
    And gave me up to tears.

Another part of the field

Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER

  FLUELLEN.
 I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his father
    was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
 There is a river in
    Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth; it is
    call'd Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the
    name of the other river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my
    fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both.

  GOWER.

  FLUELLEN.
 Take a trumpet, herald,
    Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill;
    If they will fight with us, bid them come down
    Or void the field; they do offend our sight.

  KING HENRY.
 They call it Agincourt.
 They did, Fluellen.
 I wear it for a memorable honour;
    For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
 Call yonder fellow hither.

                                     Exeunt heralds with MONTJOY
  EXETER.
 Soldier, why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap?
  WILLIAMS.
 What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit this
    soldier keep his oath?
  FLUELLEN.
 It may be his enemy is a gentlemen of great sort, quite
    from the answer of his degree.
 Who serv'st thou under?
  WILLIAMS.
                               Exit
  KING HENRY.
 Know'st thou Gower?
  FLUELLEN.
 Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
 My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,
    Follow Fluellen closely at the heels;
    The glove which I have given him for a favour
    May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.
                      Exeunt




SCENE VIII.


                         Enter FLUELLEN

  FLUELLEN.
 Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his
    payment into plows, I warrant you.
 I am no traitor.
 I charge you in his Majesty's
    name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the Duke Alencon's.
 How now! how now! what's the matter?
  FLUELLEN.
 How now! what's the matter?
  FLUELLEN.

  WILLIAMS.

  KING HENRY.
 Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
    And give it to this fellow.

  WILLIAMS.
 Now, herald, are the dead numb'red?  
  HERALD.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.
 Grant him there.
 There seen,
    Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
    Athwart the sea.

France.
 There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all
    things.
 'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks.

  FLUELLEN.
 You say very true, scald knave- when God's will is.

  PISTOL.
 Yes, certainly, and out of doubt, and out of question
    too, and ambiguides.

  FLUELLEN.
 Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.
 Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I have  
    another leek in my pocket which you shall eat.
 I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.
 If I owe you anything I will pay you in cudgels; you
    shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels.
 God bye
    you, and keep you, and heal your pate.
 Go, go: you are a couterfeit cowardly knave.
 Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
    News have I that my Nell is dead i' th' spital
    Of malady of France;
    And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.

  FRENCH KING.

  KING HENRY.
 Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?
  ALICE.

  KING HENRY.
 The Princess is the better English-woman.
 If thou
    canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to thee that I
    shall die is true- but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love
    thee too.

    What! a speaker is but a prater: a rhyme is but a ballad.

  KATHERINE.

  KATHERINE.
 Je quand sur le
    possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi-
    let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!- donc votre est  
    France et vous etes mienne.
' Which word thou shalt no sooner
    bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud 'England is
    thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet
    is thine'; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not
    fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good
    fellows.
 Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere.

  KATHERINE.

  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.

  ALICE.
 God save your Majesty! My royal cousin,
    Teach you our princess English?
  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent
    winking.

  BURGUNDY.
 Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities  
    turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls
    that war hath never ent'red.
 So please you.

  KING HENRY.

  FRENCH KING.

  FRENCH KING.
 Fortune made his sword;
    By which the world's best garden he achieved,
    And of it left his son imperial lord.

 Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH,
attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France,
the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER,
the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

  BEDFORD.

  GLOUCESTER.

    What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
    That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
    Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
    Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
    By magic verses have contriv'd his end?
  WINCHESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe
    More than God or religious churchmen may.

  BEDFORD.
 Heralds, wait on us.

  BEDFORD.

  WINCHESTER.
 Is Talbot slain? Then I will slay myself,
    For living idly here in pomp and ease,
    Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
    Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.

  THIRD MESSENGER.

    Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
    Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake.
  
  THIRD MESSENGER.
 Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
    Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
    Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
              Exit
  EXETER.
 To Eltham will I, where the young King is,
    Being ordain'd his special governor;
    And for his safety there I'll best devise.
  [Aside]  Each hath his place and function to
    attend:
    I am left out; for me nothing remains.


                  France.
 Before Orleans

      Sound a flourish.
 Let's raise the siege.

    Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
    Him I forgive my death that killeth me,
    When he sees me go back one foot or flee.
 Who ever saw the like? What men have I!
    Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled
    But that they left me midst my enemies.
 Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
  
  CHARLES.
 Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.

    A holy maid hither with me I bring,
    Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,
    Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
    And drive the English forth the bounds of France.

    The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
    Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
    What's past and what's to come she can descry.

    Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
    For they are certain and unfallible.
 Go, call her in.
                       [Exit BASTARD]
    But first, to try her skill,
    Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;
    Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;
    By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.


                  Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with  
                          JOAN LA PUCELLE

  REIGNIER.
 Fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  PUCELLE.

  PUCELLE.
 Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
    My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.

    Ask me what question thou canst possible,
    And I will answer unpremeditated.

    Only this proof I'll of thy valour make
    In single combat thou shalt buckle with me;
    And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
    Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
  
  CHARLES.
 Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.

    'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
 Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
 He may mean more than we poor men do know;
    These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.

  PUCELLE.

    This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.

    Glory is like a circle in the water,
    Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
    Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
 Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?  
    Thou with an eagle art inspired then.

  FIRST SERVING-MAN.

    We do no otherwise than we are will'd.

  GLOUCESTER.

    From him I have express commandment
    That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
  
  SERVING-MEN.
 How now, ambitious Humphry! What means
    this?
  GLOUCESTER.
 I do, thou most usurping proditor,
    And not Protector of the King or realm.
 I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back.
 Do what thou dar'st; I beard thee to thy face.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Out, tawny-coats! Out, scarlet hypocrite!

         Here GLOUCESTER'S men beat out the CARDINAL'S
        men; and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF  
                  LONDON and his OFFICERS

  MAYOR.

  WINCHESTER.
  
  OFFICER.
 Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law;
    But we shall meet and break our minds at large.

  MAYOR.
 See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
 Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
    Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.

    If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
    And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.
 Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
    I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
 Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.

    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.

    Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.

    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.

    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
 Then enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
       driving Englishmen before her.

                                              [They fight again]
  PUCELLE.
 My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
    I know not where I am nor what I do.
 Alarum; retreat



                             SCENE 6.

  CHARLES.
 Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,
    How shall I honour thee for this success?
    Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens,
    That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.

    Recover'd is the town of Orleans.

    A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
    Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was.
 Sergeant, you shall.
           [Exit SERGEANT]
    Thus are poor servitors,
    When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
    Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.
 Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,
    Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,
    To join with witches and the help of hell!
  BURGUNDY.
 Traitors have never other company.
 A maid, they say.
 Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:
    God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
    Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.

  TALBOT.

    Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
    Of English Henry, shall this night appear
    How much in duty I am bound to both.
 Unready! Ay, and glad we 'scap'd so well.
 Had all your quarters been as safely kept
    As that whereof I had the government,
    We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd.

  BASTARD.
 Mine was secure.

  REIGNIER.
 Question, my lords, no further of the case,
    How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place
    But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
 I'll be so bold to take what they have left.


                      ORLEANS.
 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
    Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
    They did amongst the troops of armed men
    Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.

  
                          Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.
 Is it even so? Nay, then I see our wars
    Will turn into a peaceful comic sport,
    When ladies crave to be encount'red with.
 Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
    Could not prevail with all their oratory,
    Yet hath a woman's kindness overrul'd;
    And therefore tell her I return great thanks  
    And in submission will attend on her.
  [Whispers]   You perceive my mind?
  CAPTAIN.

  PORTER.


    Enter MESSENGER and TALBOT.

  COUNTESS.
 Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
    To know the cause of your abrupt departure.

  TALBOT.
 Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to
    moan.

  COUNTESS.
 Enter soldiers

    How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded
    That Talbot is but shadow of himself?  
    These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
    With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
    Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
    And in a moment makes them desolate.


                   London.
 Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;
    The garden here is more convenient.

  PLANTAGENET.
 Faith, I have been a truant in the law
    And never yet could frame my will to it;
    And therefore frame the law unto my will.
 Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
    The truth appears so naked on my side
    That any purblind eye may find it out.
 Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
    In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.
 I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
    And say withal I think he held the right.

  VERNON.
 Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
    Till you conclude that he upon whose side
    The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
    Shall yield the other in the right opinion.

  PLANTAGENET.
 If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
    Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
    And keep me on the side where still I am.
 Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
    Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
 Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
    I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
 By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
    On any plot of ground in Christendom.
 My father was attached, not attainted;
    Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
    And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
    Were growing time once ripened to my will.

  SOMERSET.
 Ay, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
    And know us by these colours for thy foes
    For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.

  SUFFOLK.
 How I am brav'd, and must perforce endure
    it!
  WARWICK.

    Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
    Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
    Will I upon thy party wear this rose;
    And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
    Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,
    Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
    A thousand souls to death and deadly night.

  PLANTAGENET.
 Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you  
    That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
 In your behalf still will I wear the same.

    Come, let us four to dinner.
            Exeunt




                             SCENE 5.
 Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
    Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

  MORTIMER.
 Enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.

    Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.


                     Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET

  FIRST KEEPER.
 Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
  PLANTAGENET.

    And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
    Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd?
  PLANTAGENET.

    Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
    In honour of a true Plantagenet,
    And for alliance sake, declare the cause  
    My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.

    Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
    Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
    Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then deriv'd
    From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
    Marrying my sister, that thy mother was,
    Again, in pity of my hard distress,
    Levied an army, weening to redeem
    And have install'd me in the diadem;
    But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,
    And was beheaded.

    But now thy uncle is removing hence,
    As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
    With long continuance in a settled place.
                Exit

ACT III.

    If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,
    As he will have me, how am I so poor?
    Or how haps it I seek not to advance  
    Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
    And for dissension, who preferreth peace
    More than I do, except I be provok'd?
    No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
    It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke:
    It is because no one should sway but he;
    No one but he should be about the King;
    And that engenders thunder in his breast
    And makes him roar these accusations forth.
 Rome shall remedy this.

  WARWICK.
 Roam thither then.

  WARWICK.
 An uproar, I dare warrant,
    Begun through malice of the Bishop's men.
 O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
    Pity the city of London, pity us!
    The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
    Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
    Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
    And, banding themselves in contrary parts,  
    Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
    That many have their giddy brains knock'd out.
 My lord, we know your Grace to be a
    man
    Just and upright, and for your royal birth  
    Inferior to none but to his Majesty;
    And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
    So kind a father of the commonweal,
    To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
    We and our wives and children all will fight
    And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes.
          [Begin again]
  GLOUCESTER.
  
    You see what mischief, and what murder too,
    Hath been enacted through your enmity;
    Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood.
 And I will see what physic the tavern
    affords.

  WARWICK.
 Well urg'd, my Lord of Warwick; for, sweet  
    prince,
    An if your Grace mark every circumstance,
    You have great reason to do Richard right;
    Especially for those occasions
    At Eltham Place I told your Majesty.

  WINCHESTER.
 Welcome, high Prince, the mighty Duke of York!
  SOMERSET.

    And now I fear that fatal prophecy.


                      France.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
    And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
    Therefore we'll knock.
  
  WATCH.
 Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the
    ground.
 Here ent'red Pucelle and her practisants;
    Now she is there, how will she specify
    Here is the best and safest passage in?
  ALENCON.

  CHARLES.
 Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
    A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
  ALENCON.
 Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.

  BEDFORD.
 Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.

  BEDFORD.
 Whither away? To save myself by flight:
    We are like to have the overthrow again.
 Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
    For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.

    Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
  BURGUNDY.
 But where is Pucelle now?
    I think her old familiar is asleep.
 But yet, before we go, let's not forget
    The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd,
    But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen.

    A braver soldier never couched lance,
    A gentler heart did never sway in court;
    But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
    For that's the end of human misery.

  CHARLES.
  
    Employ thee, then, sweet virgin, for our good.

  CHARLES.
 Your honours shall perceive how I will work
    To bring this matter to the wished end.
 Enter, and pass over
                at a distance, TALBOT and his forces
  
    There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
    And all the troops of English after him.
 Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
  PUCELLE.
 The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
 What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching
    hence.

  PUCELLE.
 Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
    Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.

  BURGUNDY.

    Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen
    And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.

  CHARLES.
 Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
    And seek how we may prejudice the foe.
                Exeunt




                          SCENE 4.
 My gracious Prince, and honourable peers,
    Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
    I have awhile given truce unto my wars
    To do my duty to my sovereign;
    In sign whereof, this arm that hath reclaim'd
    To your obedience fifty fortresses,
    Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,
    Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
    Lets fall his sword before your Highness' feet,
    And with submissive loyalty of heart
    Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
    First to my God and next unto your Grace.

  KING HENRY.
 Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
    Disgracing of these colours that I wear
    In honour of my noble Lord of York
    Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st?
  BASSET.
 Why, what is he? As good a man as York!
  VERNON.

    But I'll unto his Majesty and crave
    I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
    When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
 The palace

Enter the KING, GLOUCESTER, WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,
TALBOT, EXETER, the GOVERNOR OF PARIS, and others

  GLOUCESTER.
  
  GLOUCESTER.

  TALBOT.
 He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
 Is that the worst this letter doth contain?  
  GLOUCESTER.

    And what offence it is to flout his friends.
 Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick
    men, When for so slight and frivolous a cause
    Such factious emulations shall arise!
    Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
    Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.

  SOMERSET.
 There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
 It grieves his Highness.
 Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,
                                                  EXETER, VERNON
  WARWICK.
 My Lord of York, I promise you, the King
    Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
 And so he did; but yet I like it not,
    In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
 An if I wist he did-but let it rest;
    Other affairs must now be managed.
 Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
    For had the passions of thy heart burst out,
    I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
    More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
    Than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd.

    'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
    But more when envy breeds unkind division:
    There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.
           Exit




                               SCENE 2.


             Trumpet sounds a parley.
 Thou ominous and fearful owl of
    death,
    Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
    The period of thy tyranny approacheth.

    On us thou canst not enter but by death;
    For, I protest, we are well fortified,
    And strong enough to issue out and fight.

    If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
    Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee.

    On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
    To wall thee from the liberty of flight,
    And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
    But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
    And pale destruction meets thee in the face.

    Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
    To rive their dangerous artillery
    Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.

                                                 [Drum afar off]
    Hark! hark! The Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,
    Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;
    And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.

    Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.

    Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
    And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
 Are not the speedy scouts return'd again
    That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
  MESSENGER.
  
    We mourn: France smiles.
 We lose: they daily get-
    All long of this vile traitor Somerset.

  LUCY.
 Thus, while the vulture of sedition
    Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,
    Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
    The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,
    That ever-living man of memory,  
    Henry the Fifth.


                     Other plains of Gascony

        Enter SOMERSET, With his forces; an OFFICER of
                     TALBOT'S with him

  SOMERSET.

  SOMERSET.

  SOMERSET.
 York lies; he might have sent and had the horse.
 Too late comes rescue; he is ta'en or slain,
    For fly he could not if he would have fled;
    And fly would Talbot never, though he might.

  SOMERSET.

  JOHN.

  JOHN.
 Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.

    There is no hope that ever I will stay
    If the first hour I shrink and run away.

  TALBOT.
 Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
 Upon my blessing I command thee go.
  
  JOHN.

  JOHN.

    If death be so apparent, then both fly.

  TALBOT.

    Come, side by side together live and die;
    And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.

    O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
    To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
    If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,  
    To-morrow I shall die with mickle age.

    On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
    To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
    Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
    The coward horse that bears me fall and die!
    And like me to the peasant boys of France,
    To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
    Surely, by all the glory you have won,
    An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son;
    Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
    If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.

  TALBOT.
          Exeunt




                               SCENE 7.


                      Another part of the field

       Alarum; excursions.

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
 O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!
  TALBOT.
 Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,
    To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day.

  CHARLES.

    But tell me whom thou seek'st.

    Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides,
    Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.

    Were but his picture left amongst you here,
    It would amaze the proudest of you all.

    Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence  
    And give them burial as beseems their worth.

    For God's sake, let him have them; to keep them here,
    They would but stink, and putrefy the air.
          Exeunt

  KING HENRY.
 What! Is my Lord of Winchester install'd
    And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
    Then I perceive that will be verified
    Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:
    'If once he come to be a cardinal,  
    He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.
 And for the proffer of my lord your master,
    I have inform'd his Highness so at large,
    As, liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,
    Her beauty, and the value of her dower,
    He doth intend she shall be England's Queen.

    And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded
    And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd,
    Commit them to the fortune of the sea.

  WINCHESTER.
  [Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit, I
    trow,
    Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
 Plains in Anjou

              Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD,
                   REIGNIER, LA PUCELLE, and forces

  CHARLES.
 Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;
    Else ruin combat with their palaces!

                            Enter a SCOUT

  SCOUT.
 Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
    But we will presently provide for them.

  CHARLES.


                         Before Angiers

              Alarum, excursions.
 Enter LA PUCELLE

  PUCELLE.

                                                   [They depart]
    See! they forsake me.

    Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.

         LA PUCELLE and YORK fight hand to hand; LA PUCELLE
                    is taken.
 A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and thee!
    And may ye both be suddenly surpris'd
    By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
  YORK.

  YORK.

    Yet, if this servile usage once offend,
    Go and be free again as Suffolk's friend.
 Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,
    What ransom must I pay before I pass?
    For I perceive I am thy prisoner.

  SUFFOLK.
  [Aside]  I'll win this Lady Margaret.
 For whom?
    Why, for my King! Tush, that's a wooden thing!
  MARGARET.
 He talks of wood.
 Hear ye, Captain-are you not at leisure?
  SUFFOLK.
  [Aside]  It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
  [Aside]  What though I be enthrall'd? He seems
    a knight,
    And will not any way dishonour me.
  [Aside]  Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French;
    And then I need not crave his courtesy.
 Lady, wherefore talk you so?
  MARGARET.
 I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
    To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
    And set a precious crown upon thy head,
    If thou wilt condescend to be my-
  MARGARET.

  SUFFOLK.
 Suffolk, what remedy?
    I am a soldier and unapt to weep
    Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
 Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
    Fit to be made companion with a king.

  SUFFOLK.

    [Aside]  And yet, methinks, I could be well content
    To be mine own attorney in this case.

    I'll over then to England with this news,
    And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.
          [She is going]
  SUFFOLK.
 Farewell, sweet madam.
 Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,
    Never yet taint with love, I send the King.

                                    Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
  SUFFOLK.

    Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise.
 Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.
 Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
    I am descended of a gentler blood;
    Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
    The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
 Away with her to execution!  
  WARWICK.

    Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
    That so her torture may be shortened.
 She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
 You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his:
    It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.

  YORK.

  WARWICK.
 Be patient, York.

  YORK.
 Must he be then as shadow of himself?
    Adorn his temples with a coronet
    And yet, in substance and authority,
    Retain but privilege of a private man?
    This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
  [To CHARLES]  To say the truth, it is your policy
    To save your subjects from such massacre
    And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
    By our proceeding in hostility;
    And therefore take this compact of a truce,
    Although you break it when your pleasure serves.

    Her virtues, graced with external gifts,
    Do breed love's settled passions in my heart;
    And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
    Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
    So am I driven by breath of her renown
    Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
    Where I may have fruition of her love.

  KING HENRY.

    How shall we then dispense with that contract,
    And not deface your honour with reproach?
  SUFFOLK.
 And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
    Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.

  EXETER.
 A dow'r, my lords! Disgrace not so your king,
    That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
    To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.

    Henry is able to enrich his queen,
    And not to seek a queen to make him rich.

    And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
    It most of all these reasons bindeth us
    In our opinions she should be preferr'd;
    For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
    An age of discord and continual strife?
    Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
    And is a pattern of celestial peace.

    Take therefore shipping; post, my lord, to France;
    Agree to any covenants; and procure
    That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
    To cross the seas to England, and be crown'd
    King Henry's faithful and anointed queen.

    Be gone, I say; for till you do return  
    I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.

    And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
    If you do censure me by what you were,
    Not what you are, I know it will excuse
    This sudden execution of my will.
 Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.

                                    Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
  SUFFOLK.
 Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
    As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
    With hope to find the like event in love
    But prosper better than the Troyan did.
          Exit

London.

  QUEEN.
                            [Flourish]
  SUFFOLK.

  GLOUCESTER.
 [Reads] 'Imprimis: It is agreed between the French King
    Charles and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador
    for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the
    Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia,
    and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth
    of May next ensuing.

    We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,
    And girt thee with the sword.
 Cousin of York,
    We here discharge your Grace from being Regent
    I' th' parts of France, till term of eighteen months
    Be full expir'd.
 Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,  
    To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
    Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
 Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
    This peroration with such circumstance?
    For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.

    Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
    Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
    Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
    Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
 A proper jest, and never heard before,
    That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
    For costs and charges in transporting her!
    She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France,  
    Before-
  CARDINAL.
              Exit
  CARDINAL.
 So, there goes our Protector in a rage.

    Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
    And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
    There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.
  
    Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words
    Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
 Why should he then protect our sovereign,
    He being of age to govern of himself?
    Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
    And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
    We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
                  Exit
  SOMERSET.

                                  Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
  SALISBURY.

    And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,  
    In bringing them to civil discipline,
    Thy late exploits done in the heart of France
    When thou wert Regent for our sovereign,
    Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
    Join we together for the public good,
    In what we can, to bridle and suppress
    The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal,
    With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
    And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
    While they do tend the profit of the land.
 So God help Warwick, as he loves the land
    And common profit of his country!
  YORK.

  WARWICK.

    Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
    Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
    Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
    Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.

    Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.

  DUCHESS.

    Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtur'd Eleanor!
    Art thou not second woman in the realm,
    And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him?
    Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
    Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
    And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
    To tumble down thy husband and thyself
    From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
    Away from me, and let me hear no more!
  DUCHESS.
 What, what, my lord! Are you so choleric
    With Eleanor for telling but her dream?
    Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself
    And not be check'd.


                           Enter HUME

  HUME.
 Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!  
  DUCHESS.
 What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace.

    Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,
    With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
 Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold;
    Marry, and shall.

                                       [Tears the supplications]
    Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
                               Exeunt
  QUEEN.
 My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
    Is this the fashions in the court of England?
    Is this the government of Britain's isle,
    And this the royalty of Albion's king?
    What, shall King Henry be a pupil still,
    Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
    Am I a queen in title and in style,
    And must be made a subject to a duke?
    I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
    Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
    And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
    I thought King Henry had resembled thee
    In courage, courtship, and proportion;
    But all his mind is bent to holiness,
    To number Ave-Maries on his beads;  
    His champions are the prophets and apostles;
    His weapons, holy saws of sacred writ;
    His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
    Are brazen images of canonized saints.

    I would the college of the Cardinals
    Would choose him Pope, and carry him to Rome,
    And set the triple crown upon his head;
    That were a state fit for his holiness.

  QUEEN.

    Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.
 Enter the KING, DUKE HUMPHREY,
     CARDINAL BEAUFORT, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY,
              WARWICK, and the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER

  KING HENRY.

  YORK.

  SOMERSET.

  WARWICK.
 Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,
    Dispute not that; York is the worthier.
  
  WARWICK.
 Warwick may live to be the best of all.

  SALISBURY.
 Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
    Have cost a mass of public treasury.

  QUEEN.
 The QUEEN drops QUEEN her fan
    Give me my fan.

  KING HENRY.

    Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
    She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd.
 Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
    I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.

    I do beseech your royal Majesty,
    Let him have all the rigour of the law.
 Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words.
 Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!
    The spite of man prevaileth against me.
 Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.
 Come, my masters; the Duchess, I tell you, expects
    performance of your promises.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.
 Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 [Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'  
  SPIRIT.
 The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
    But him outlive, and die a violent death.
 Descend to darkness and the burning lake;
    False fiend, avoid!       Thunder and lightning.
 Exit SPIRIT

               Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUKE OF
                 BUCKINGHAM with guard, and break in

                Exeunt, above, DUCHESS and HUME, guarded; below,
                       WITCH, SOUTHWELL and BOLINGBROKE, guarded
  YORK.
 Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
    To be the post, in hope of his reward.
 At your pleasure, my good lord.

    Who's within there, ho?

                       Enter a serving-man  

    Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick

 SCENE I.

  KING HENRY.
 But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
    And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
    To see how God in all His creatures works!
    Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
 No marvel, an it like your Majesty,
    My Lord Protector's hawks do tow'r so well;
    They know their master loves to be aloft,
    And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
 I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Ay, my lord Cardinal, how think you by that?  
    Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?
  KING HENRY.
 The treasury of everlasting joy!
  CARDINAL.
 No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
    So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

    How irksome is this music to my heart!
    When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
    I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
 A miracle! A miracle!
  SUFFOLK.
 Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.
 Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Albans shrine
    Within this half hour hath receiv'd his sight;  
    A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
 Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
    That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
 Born blind, an't please your Grace.

  SUFFOLK.
 What woman is this?  
  WIFE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
    Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
 How cam'st thou so?
  SIMPCOX.
 A plum tree, master.
 What, and wouldst climb a tree?
  SIMPCOX.
 Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
 Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
    And made me climb, With danger of my life.
 Never before this day in all his life.
 Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
  SIMPCOX.
 Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.

  MAYOR.

                                               Exit an attendant
  GLOUCESTER.
 It made me laugh to see the villain run.

  SUFFOLK.
 But you have done more miracles than I:
    You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.

    Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;
    And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the
    Or to the meanest groom.
 Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest;
    And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

    Noble she is; but if she have forgot
    Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such
    As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
    I banish her my bed and company
    And give her as a prey to law and shame,
    That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name.
 Well, for this night we will repose us here.

  YORK.
 Father, the Duke hath told the truth;
    Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.

  YORK.

    But, to the rest.

    Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
    And in this private plot be we the first
    That shall salute our rightful sovereign
    With honour of his birthright to the crown.

  WARWICK.

  YORK.

London.

    You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
    Despoiled of your honour in your life,
    Shall, after three days' open penance done,
    Live in your country here in banishment
    With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.

    I cannot justify whom the law condemns.

  QUEEN.

    Farewell, good King; when I am dead and gone,
    May honourable peace attend thy throne!                 Exit
  QUEEN.

  SUFFOLK.
 A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;
    Here let them end it, and God defend the right!
  YORK.
 And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour;
    drink, and fear not your man.

  HORNER.

  SECOND PRENTICE.

  PETER.

    Sirs, what's o'clock?
  SERVING-MAN.

    Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
    The abject people gazing on thy face,
    With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
    That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
    When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.

    But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare
    My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.

  GLOUCESTER.

  DUCHESS.

    Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
    Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world
    Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
    No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
    To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
 Ah, Nell, forbear! Thou aimest all awry.

    I must offend before I be attainted;
    And had I twenty times so many foes,
    And each of them had twenty times their power,
    All these could not procure me any scathe
    So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.

    Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
    Why, yet thy scandal were not wip'd away,
    But I in danger for the breach of law.
 I summon your Grace to his Majesty's Parliament,
    Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
 An't please your Grace, here my commission stays;
    And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
    To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
 So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
 Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee!  
    For none abides with me.

  DUCHESS.
 Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
    Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.

  SHERIFF.

    Come, Stanley, shall we go?
  STANLEY.
 Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
    And go we to attire you for our journey.
 My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.

    Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.

The Abbey at Bury St.
 I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come.

    'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
    Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
 Can you not see, or will ye not observe
    The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
    With what a majesty he bears himself;
    How insolent of late he is become,
    How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
    We know the time since he was mild and affable,
    And if we did but glance a far-off look
    Immediately he was upon his knee,
    That all the court admir'd him for submission.

    By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts;
    And when he please to make commotion,
    'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.

    If it be fond, can it a woman's fear;  
    Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
    I will subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke.

    My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
    Reprove my allegation if you can,
    Or else conclude my words effectual.

    The Duchess, by his subornation,
    Upon my life, began her devilish practices;
    Or if he were not privy to those faults,
    Yet by reputing of his high descent-
    As next the King he was successive heir-
    And such high vaunts of his nobility,
    Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess
    By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.

    Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
    And in his simple show he harbours treason.

    The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
 Did he not, contrary to form of law,
    Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  YORK.
 And did he not, in his protectorship,
    Levy great sums of money through the realm
    For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
    By means whereof the towns each day revolted.

  BUCKINGHAM.

  QUEEN.

  KING HENRY.
 All happiness unto my lord the King!
    Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.

  GLOUCESTER.

    The purest spring is not so free from mud
    As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.
 I say no more than truth, so help me God!
  YORK.

  KING HENRY.
 My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
    That you will clear yourself from all suspense.

    I know their complot is to have my life;
    And if my death might make this island happy
    And prove the period of their tyranny,
    I would expend it with all willingness.

    Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
    And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
    Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
    The envious load that lies upon his heart;
    And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
    Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
    By false accuse doth level at my life.

    The ancient proverb will be well effected:  
    'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.

    Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!
    For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
 Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
    Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;
    My body round engirt with misery-
    For what's more miserable than discontent?
    Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
    The map of honour, truth, and loyalty!
    And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
    That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith.

  SUFFOLK.

  SUFFOLK.
 And so say I.

  SOMERSET.

    I rather would have lost my life betimes
    Than bring a burden of dishonour home
    By staying there so long till all were lost.

    Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been Regent there,
    Might happily have prov'd far worse than his.
 And in the number, thee that wishest shame!
  CARDINAL.
 Why, our authority is his consent,
    And what we do establish he confirms;
    Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.

    Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man
    And find no harbour in a royal heart.

    My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,
    Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.

    Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured;
    I know no pain they can inflict upon him
    Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.

    Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
    Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,
    And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
    For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
    And Henry put apart, the next for me.

  SUFFOLK.
 Go call our uncle to our presence straight;
    Say we intend to try his Grace to-day,
    If he be guilty, as 'tis published.
          Exit
  KING HENRY.
 I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
 Marry, God forfend!
  CARDINAL.

  SOMERSET.
 O heavenly God!
  QUEEN.
 What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
    Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
    Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs;
    And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
    By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
    Can chase away the first conceived sound?  
    Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words;
    Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say,
    Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.

    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.

    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

  WARWICK.
 O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts-
    My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;  
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
 Enter WARWICK

  WARWICK.
 Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.

  SUFFOLK.
 A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
    What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
  WARWICK.
 I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
    But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
    That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.

    Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.

                           Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others
  WARWICK.
 Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,
    If from this presence thou dar'st go with me.
 Why, how now, lords, your wrathful weapons drawn
    Here in our presence! Dare you be so bold?
    Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
  SUFFOLK.
 [To the Commons within] Sirs, stand apart, the King
      shall know your mind.

    Dread lord, the commons send you word by me
    Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
    Or banished fair England's territories,
    They will by violence tear him from your palace  
    And torture him with grievous ling'ring death.

    They say, in care of your most royal person,
    That if your Highness should intend to sleep
    And charge that no man should disturb your rest,
    In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
    Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
    Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
    That slily glided towards your Majesty,
    It were but necessary you were wak'd,
    Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,
    The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal.

  COMMONS.

  COMMONS.
 Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me
    I thank them for their tender loving care;
    And had I not been cited so by them,
    Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
    For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
    Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means.

    And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
    Whose far unworthy deputy I am,  
    He shall not breathe infection in this air
    But three days longer, on the pain of death.

  QUEEN.
 Poison be their drink!
    Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
    Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
    Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks!  
    Their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings!
    Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
    And boding screech-owls make the consort full!
    all the foul terrors in dark-seated hell-
  QUEEN.
 You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
    Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
    Well could I curse away a winter's night,
    Though standing naked on a mountain top
    Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
    And think it but a minute spent in sport.
 O, let me entreat thee cease! Give me thy hand,
    That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
    Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
    To wash away my woeful monuments.

    I will repeal thee or, be well assur'd,
    Adventure to be banished myself;
    And banished I am, if but from thee.
  
    I can no more: Live thou to joy thy life;
    Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st.
 To signify unto his Majesty
    That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
    For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
    That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air,
    Blaspheming God, and cursing men on earth.

    Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
    Were by his side; sometime he calls the King
    And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
    The secrets of his overcharged soul;
    And I am sent to tell his Majesty
    That even now he cries aloud for him.

  SUFFOLK.
 Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,
    It is applied to a deathful wound.
 This way for me.
                       Exeunt severally




SCENE III.

    Alive again? Then show me where he is;
    I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.

    Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,
    Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul!
    Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary  
    Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

    Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;
    And thou that art his mate make boot of this;
    The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.

  LIEUTENANT.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
 Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not:
    Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
    But with our sword we wip'd away the blot;
    Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
    Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd,
    And I proclaim'd a coward through the world.
 Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
    The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
 Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:
    Jove sometime went disguis'd, and why not I?
  LIEUTENANT.

    Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup,
    Bareheaded plodded by my foot-cloth mule,  
    And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
    How often hast thou waited at my cup,
    Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board,
    When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
    Remember it, and let it make thee crestfall'n,
    Ay, and allay thus thy abortive pride,
    How in our voiding-lobby hast thou stood
    And duly waited for my coming forth.

    This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
    And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.

  SUFFOLK.

    Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives.

    It is impossible that I should die
    By such a lowly vassal as thyself.

    Thy words move rage and not remorse in me.
 Walter-
  WHITMORE.
 Gelidus timor occupat artus: it is thee I fear.

    True nobility is exempt from fear:
    More can I bear than you dare execute.

  LIEUTENANT.

                                        Exit WALTER with SUFFOLK
  LIEUTENANT.
 They have the more need to sleep now, then.
 O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.
 The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.

  JOHN.
 True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is
    as much to say as 'Let the magistrates be labouring men'; and
    therefore should we be magistrates.

 Nay, that I mean to do.
 Here's a villain!

 Here I am, thou particular fellow.
 Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down.
 He shall be

 And what of that?

  DICK.
 Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.

 Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
 Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
 O gross and miserable ignorance!

 But then are we in order when we are most out of order.

    Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast;
    But where's the body that I should embrace?

    But stay, I'll read it over once again.

  SAY.
 No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

  KING HENRY.
 The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
    Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
    Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
    And calls your Grace usurper, openly,
    And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
 Come Margaret; God, our hope, will succour us.
 My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceas'd.

 Now is Mortimer lord of this city.

    Come, let's away.

    blank of our jurisdiction regal.
 Nothing but this: 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.
 Away with him, away with him! He speaks Latin.

    Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
    Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle.

    I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy;
    Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.

    Justice with favour have I always done;
    Pray'rs and tears have mov'd me, gifts could never.

  CADE.
 Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
  SAY.
 Give him a box o' th' ear, and that will make 'em red again.

  CADE.

    Take him away, and behead him.
 Tell me: wherein have I offended most?
    Have I affected wealth or honour? Speak.
 He shall die, an it be but for pleading so well for
    his life.
 But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another, for they
    lov'd well when they were alive.
 Now part them again, lest they
    consult about the giving up of some more towns in France.

    And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
 Let them break your backs with burdens, take your
    houses over your heads, ravish your wives and daughters before
    your faces.
 For me, I will make shift for one; and so God's curse
    light upon you all!
  ALL.
 We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
  CLIFFORD.

    Spare England, for it is your native coast.

 Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,

    Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives,

 In any case be not too rough in terms,
    For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.

SCENE X.
 And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
    must serve me to feed on.

 Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five  
    days, yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you
    all as dead as a door-nail, I pray God I may never eat grass

    As for words, whose greatness answers words,
    Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
 Tell Kent from

    cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine,
    not by valour.

    Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels  
    Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,
    And there cut off thy most ungracious head,
    Which I will bear in triumph to the King,
    Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

                         Enter BUCKINGHAM

    [Aside] Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
    The King hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
  
  YORK.

    I am far better born than is the King,
    More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;
    But I must make fair weather yet awhile,
    Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.
  
    The cause why I have brought this army hither
    Is to remove proud Somerset from the King,
    Seditious to his Grace and to the state.
 Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my pow'rs.

    I'll send them all as willing as I live:
    Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have,
    Is his to use, so Somerset may die.
  
    We twain will go into his Highness' tent.

  KING HENRY.

    Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
  IDEN.

  KING HENRY.
 How now! Is Somerset at liberty?
    Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts
    And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.

    Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,
    And with the same to act controlling laws.
 By heaven, thou shalt rule no more
    O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.

  CLIFFORD.
 This is my King, York, I do not mistake;
    But thou mistakes me much to think I do.

    To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?
  KING HENRY.

  QUEEN.

  RICHARD.

    Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
    That with the very shaking of their chains
    They may astonish these fell-lurking curs.

    Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
 Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
 A subtle traitor needs no sophister.

  WARWICK.
 Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
    The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,
    This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,
    As on a mountain-top the cedar shows,
    That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
    Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
 Fie! charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,
    For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.

SCENE II.
 Enter WARWICK

  WARWICK.
 Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls;
    And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
    Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
    And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
    Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me.


                          Enter YORK

    How now, my noble lord! what, all a-foot?
  YORK.


                      Enter OLD CLIFFORD  

  WARWICK.

  WARWICK.
 Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.

    As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,
    It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
 So let it help me now against thy sword,
    As I in justice and true right express it!
  CLIFFORD.
 Shame and confusion! All is on the rout;
    Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
    Where it should guard.

    He that is truly dedicate to war
    Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
    Hath not essentially, but by circumstance,
    The name of valour.
                 [Sees his father's body]
    O, let the vile world end
    And the premised flames of the last day
    Knit earth and heaven together!
    Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
    Particularities and petty sounds
    To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
    To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve  
    The silver livery of advised age,
    And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
    To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
    My heart is turn'd to stone; and while 'tis mine
    It shall be stony.

    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;
    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
    But then Aeneas bare a living load,
    Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
 So, lie thou there;
    For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
    The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset
    Hath made the wizard famous in his death.

    Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
    Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
 What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.

                                               [Alarum afar off]
    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom  
    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-
    As well we may, if not through your neglect-
    We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
    And where this breach now in our fortunes made
    May readily be stopp'd.

    Away, my lord, away!                                  Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Retreat.
 Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
    That winter lion, who in rage forgets
    Aged contusions and all brush of time
    And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
    Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
    Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
    If Salisbury be lost.
 My noble father,
    Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
    Three times bestrid him, thrice I led him off,
    Persuaded him from any further act;
    But still where danger was, still there I met him;
    And like rich hangings in a homely house,
    So was his will in his old feeble body.

    Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

SCENE:
England and France

ACT I.
 Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
    Is either slain or wounded dangerous;
    I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.

    That this is true, father, behold his blood.

  YORK.
 And when the King comes, offer him no violence.

  YORK.
 Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
 Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
    The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
    Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.

    Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father;
    And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
    On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.

  WESTMORELAND.
 Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
 Ah, know you not the city favours them,  
    And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
  EXETER.
 Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
    In following this usurping Henry.
 And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK.
  
  WESTMORELAND.

  WARWICK.
 Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
    Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives
    Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
 Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
    I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
    As shall revenge his death before I stir.
 Will you we show our title to the crown?
    If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

  WARWICK.

  RICHARD.

  EDWARD.
 Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
 Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
 Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
 His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
 My conscience tells me he is lawful King.

  KING HENRY.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 I am content.

  CLIFFORD.
 What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK.
 Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD.
 Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
    In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
 Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING HENRY.
 Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.

                                             Exeunt the YORKISTS
  KING HENRY.
 Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.

    I'll steal away.
 Come, son, let's away;
    Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.

  PRINCE OF WALES.
 Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
 Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
    Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
    Reveng'd may she be on that hateful Duke,
    Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
    Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
    Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
    The loss of those three lords torments my heart.
 About that which concerns your Grace and us-
    The crown of England, father, which is yours.

  YORK.
 I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

    Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
    Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
    Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.

    Therefore, to arms.
 And, father, do but think
    How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
    Within whose circuit is Elysium
    And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.

    Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest
    Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd
    Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
  
  YORK.
 Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.

    Brother, thou shalt to London presently
    And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.

    And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
 She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
 Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
    Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!

                  Enter CLIFFORD and soldiers

  CLIFFORD.
 Then let my father's blood open it again:
    He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
 Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
    Were not revenge sufficient for me;
    No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
    And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
    It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart.
  
    Therefore-
  RUTLAND.
 Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
 Thy father hath.
 But 'twas ere I was born.

  CLIFFORD.
 No cause!
    Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
 Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
  CLIFFORD.

Another part of the field

Alarum.

    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.
 Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
 Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
    With downright payment show'd unto my father.
 My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
    A bird that will revenge upon you all;
    And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
    Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.

  YORK.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

    What, was it you that would be England's king?
    Was't you that revell'd in our parliament  
    And made a preachment of your high descent?
    Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
    The wanton Edward and the lusty George?
    And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
    Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
    Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
    Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
    Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
    That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point
    Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
    And if thine eyes can water for his death,
    I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.

    I prithee grieve to make me merry, York.
  
    Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport;
    York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.

    Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.

                             [Putting a paper crown on his head]
    Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
    Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
    And this is he was his adopted heir.

  CLIFFORD.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    To tell thee whence thou cam'st, of whom deriv'd,
    Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.

  YORK.

    See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears.

    This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
    And I with tears do wash the blood away.
 What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
    Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
    And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
 Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
    So York may overlook the town of York.
 Exeunt

 SCENE I.
 Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power

  EDWARD.
 I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
    Or whether he be scap'd away or no
    From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit.

    Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
    Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
    Or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard
    The happy tidings of his good escape.
  
    So far'd our father with his enemies;
    So fled his enemies my warlike father.

    See how the morning opes her golden gates
    And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.

    How well resembles it the prime of youth,
    Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
  EDWARD.
 Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  RICHARD.

  RICHARD.
 Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
    You love the breeder better than the male.
 Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
    Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
 I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
    Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;
    Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden,
    For self-same wind that I should speak withal
    Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
    And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.

  RICHARD.
 How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD.

  WARWICK.

    Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met,
    Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought;
    But whether 'twas the coldness of the King,
    Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
    That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,
    Or whether 'twas report of her success,
    Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
    Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
    I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,
    Their weapons like to lightning came and went:
    Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight
    Or like an idle thresher with a flail,  
    Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.

  EDWARD.

  WARWICK.
 Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
 No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
    The next degree is England's royal throne,
    For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
    In every borough as we pass along;
    And he that throws not up his cap for joy
    Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.

  EDWARD.
 How now! what news?
  MESSENGER.
 The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
    The Queen is coming with a puissant host,
    And craves your company for speedy counsel.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
    Inferring arguments of mighty force.

    Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
    How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!  
  QUEEN MARGARET.

    Edward, kneel down.
 Royal commanders, be in readiness;
    For with a band of thirty thousand men
    Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,
    And in the towns, as they do march along,
    Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.

    Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
 Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
 My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
    And hearten those that fight in your defence.

    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

         March.
 Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,
                NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and soldiers

  EDWARD.
 Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.

    Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
    Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
  EDWARD.
 I am his king, and he should bow his knee.

  CLIFFORD.
 And reason too:
    Who should succeed the father but the son?
  RICHARD.
 For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

  WARWICK.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  CLIFFORD.
 I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD.
 Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
    As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
    But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

  KING HENRY.
 I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
    I am a king, and privileg'd to speak.

  EDWARD.
 Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.


                     Enter EDWARD, running

  EDWARD.
 How now, my lord.
'
    So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
    That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
    The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

  EDWARD.
 Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
    Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.
  
  WARWICK.

    So is the equal poise of this fell war.

    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both  
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.

  SON.
 How will the country for these woeful chances
    Misthink the King, and not be satisfied!
  SON.

    I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
    For I have murdered where I should not kill.

  EXETER.

    Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
    Whither the Queen intends.

Another part of the field

A loud alarum.
 Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.

    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
  
    Some troops pursue the bloody-minded Queen
    That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
    As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
    Command an argosy to stern the waves.

  EDWARD.

  WARWICK.
 They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
 Now to London
    To see these honours in possession.
                   Exeunt




<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC.

    Here stand we both, and aim we at the best;
    And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
    I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
    In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
 From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
    To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.

    No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
    No humble suitors press to speak for right,
    No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
    For how can I help them and not myself?
  FIRST KEEPER.

  SECOND KEEPER.
 Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
 Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
 Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
    Your crown content and you must be contented
    To go along with us; for as we think,
    You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;
    And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
    Will apprehend you as his enemy.
 Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
    Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
    Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
    And as the air blows it to me again,
    Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
    And yielding to another when it blows,
    Commanded always by the greater gust,
    Such is the lightness of you common men.
 So would you be again to Henry,
    If he were seated as King Edward is.

  GLOUCESTER.
 [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
  KING EDWARD.
 [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
      lands,
    An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
 [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
    to fall.

  GLOUCESTER.

  KING EDWARD.
 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
 Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
 No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
 Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
 An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
 But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
 Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

  KING EDWARD.
 Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
    For by that loss I will not purchase them.

  LADY GREY.

    Please you dismiss me, either with ay or no.

  GLOUCESTER.
 The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.

  KING EDWARD.

  GLOUCESTER.


                       Enter a NOBLEMAN

  NOBLEMAN.

  KING EDWARD.

                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
  GLOUCESTER.
  
    Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,
    That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
    To cross me from the golden time I look for!
    And yet, between my soul's desire and me-
    The lustful Edward's title buried-
    Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
    And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
    To take their rooms ere I can place myself.

    A cold premeditation for my purpose!
    Why, then I do but dream on sovereignty;
    Like one that stands upon a promontory
    And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
    Wishing his foot were equal with his eye;
    And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
    Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way-
    So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
    And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
    And so I say I'll cut the causes off,
    Flattering me with impossibilities.

    Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
    What other pleasure can the world afford?
    I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
    And deck my body in gay ornaments,
    And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.

    And yet I know not how to get the crown,
    For many lives stand between me and home;
    And I- like one lost in a thorny wood
    That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
    Seeking a way and straying from the way
    Not knowing how to find the open air,
    But toiling desperately to find it out-
    Torment myself to catch the English crown;
    And from that torment I will free myself
    Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.

    I can add colours to the chameleon,
    Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,
    And set the murderous Machiavel to school.

  LEWIS.
 What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 But is he gracious in the people's eye?
  WARWICK.
 The more that Henry was unfortunate.

  LEWIS.

    Myself have often heard him say and swear
    That this his love was an eternal plant
    Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
    The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
    Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,  
    Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

  BONA.
 And still is friend to him and Margaret.

    And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
    You have a father able to maintain you,
    And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
 Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
    Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
    I will not hence till with my talk and tears,
    Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
    Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
    For both of you are birds of self-same feather.
 My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,  
    Sent from your brother, Marquis Montague.

  LEWIS.
 What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
    And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
    Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
    Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France?
    Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
    And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,  
    That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's-
    No more my king, for he dishonours me,
    But most himself, if he could see his shame.
 And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  LEWIS.

    Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.
 Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
    And I am ready to put armour on.
 stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
    And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,
    Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.

 Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
    Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
    Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
  CLARENCE.
 My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.

                          Enter a POST

  KING EDWARD.
 Now, messenger, what letters or what news
    From France?
  MESSENGER.

    What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
  MESSENGER.
 At my depart, these were his very words:
    'Go tell false Edward, the supposed king,
    That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
    To revel it with him and his new bride.
 IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.

    But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
  MESSENGER.
 I blame not her: she could say little less;
    She had the wrong.
 Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
 He, more incens'd against your Majesty
    Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:  
    'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
    And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.

    But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
  MESSENGER.
 Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
    That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

    Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
    For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
    That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
    I may not prove inferior to yourself.
 Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
    The common people by numbers swarm to us.
 Fear not that, my lord.

    And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
    Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,  
    His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
    And but attended by a simple guard,
    We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
    Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;
    That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
    With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
    And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
    So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
    At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
    And seize himself- I say not 'slaughter him,'
    For I intend but only to surprise him.
 What, will he not to bed?
  FIRST WATCHMAN.

  SECOND WATCHMAN.

  THIRD WATCHMAN.
 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
 Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
    But to defend his person from night-foes?

             Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET,
                   and French soldiers, silent all

  WARWICK.

  FIRST WATCHMAN.

  KING EDWARD.
 Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
    Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.

  WARWICK.

  KING EDWARD.
 Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
    To free King Henry from imprisonment,
    And see him seated in the regal throne.
               Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 The palace

Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS

  RIVERS.
 Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
    What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
  RIVERS.
 What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 No, but the loss of his own royal person.

  RIVERS.

    Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
    If Warwick take us, we are sure to die.
               Exeunt




SCENE V.
 This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.

    Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
    Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer?
  GLOUCESTER.
 Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
    Your horse stands ready at the park corner.
 But whither shall we then?
  HASTINGS.
 But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
 Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
              Exeunt




SCENE VI.

London.
 Enter KING HENRY, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, young HENRY,
EARL OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER, and attendants

  KING HENRY.
 Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
    But if an humble prayer may prevail,
    I then crave pardon of your Majesty.

    I make you both Protectors of this land,
    While I myself will lead a private life
    And in devotion spend my latter days,
    To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
 What else? And that succession be determin'd.

    Make much of him, my lords; for this is he
    Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
 My brother was too careless of his charge.
 It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
 Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and soldiers

  KING EDWARD.
  

         Enter, on the walls, the MAYOR OF YORK and
                       his BRETHREN

  MAYOR.
 But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
    Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.

  MAYOR.
 A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
  HASTINGS.
 What talk you of debating? In few words:
    If you'll not here proclaim yourself our King,
    I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
    To keep them back that come to succour you.
 When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
    Till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

  HASTINGS.

  GLOUCESTER.
 And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.

    Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.
 Flourish]
  SOLDIER.

                                          [Throws down gauntlet]
  ALL.
 A little fire is quickly trodden out,
    Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
 That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
    I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
    Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
    My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
    My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
    My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
    I have not been desirous of their wealth,
    Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies,
    Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd.

    Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
         Exeunt

Coventry

Enter WARWICK, the MAYOR OF COVENTRY, two MESSENGERS,
and others upon the walls

  WARWICK.
 Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER,
                         and soldiers

  KING EDWARD.
 See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
 Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
    Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down,
    Call Warwick patron, and be penitent?
    And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
 Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
  GLOUCESTER.

  WARWICK.
 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
 I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
    And with the other fling it at thy face,
    Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.
 So other foes may set upon our backs.

    Stand we in good array, for they no doubt
    Will issue out again and bid us battle;
    If not, the city being but of small defence,  
    We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same.
 And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
    Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
    With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
    More than the nature of a brother's love.
 Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
    A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
 RICHARD and CLARENCE whisper]
  WARWICK.
 [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
      it at WARWICK]
    Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
    Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.

    I am so sorry for my trespass made
    That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
    I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;
    With resolution whereso'er I meet thee-
    As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-
    To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.

  WARWICK.

  KING EDWARD.

    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
 Ah, couldst thou fly!
  WARWICK.
 Why then, I would not fly.
 Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
    For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.
 Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
                                  [Here they bear away his body]




SCENE III.
 Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest

  KING EDWARD.

    But in the midst of this bright-shining day
    I spy a black, suspicious, threat'ning cloud
    That will encounter with our glorious sun
    Ere he attain his easeful western bed-
    I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen
    Hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast
    And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

    What though the mast be now blown overboard,
    The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
    And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood;
    Yet lives our pilot still.

    This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
    If case some one of you would fly from us,
    That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers  
    More than with ruthless waves, with sands, and rocks.

  PRINCE OF WALES.
 Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
    Should, if a coward hear her speak these words,
    Infuse his breast with magnanimity
    And make him naked foil a man-at-arms.

    O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather
    Doth live again in thee.
 Long mayst thou Eve
    To bear his image and renew his glories!
  SOMERSET.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  OXFORD.

  SOMERSET.
 But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.

    I need not add more fuel to your fire,
    For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out.

    You fight in justice.

                             Alarum, retreat, excursions.

Another part of the field

Flourish.
 For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
 Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

  KING EDWARD.
 Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
    Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
  GLOUCESTER.
 Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
 Take that, the likeness of this railer here.

                                                     [Stabs him]
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 O, kill me too!
  GLOUCESTER.
 What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
 The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
 Good day, my lord.

    'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
    And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.

  KING HENRY.
 I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
    Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
    The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy,
    Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea
    Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
 Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,  
    Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine.
 What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
    Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.

    Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest;
    Counting myself but bad till I be best.

    Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
 Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
    And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
 Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

  GLOUCESTER.

  KING EDWARD.
 Away with her, and waft her hence to France.

 O, you go far!
  NORFOLK.
 The office did
    Distinctly his full function.
 Who did guide-
    I mean, who set the body and the limbs
    Of this great sport together, as you guess?  
  NORFOLK.

  ABERGAVENNY.
 Why the devil,
    Upon this French going out, took he upon him-
    Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint
    Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
    Of all the gentry; for the most part such
    To whom as great a charge as little honour
    He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,
    The honourable board of council out,
    Must fetch him in he papers.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Every man,
    After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
    A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
    Into a general prophecy-that this tempest,
    Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
    The sudden breach on't.

  ABERGAVENNY.
 Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome.
 Ay, please your Grace.

                                          Exeunt WOLSEY and his train
  BUCKINGHAM.
 What, are you chaf'd?  
    Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only
    Which your disease requires.
 To climb steep hills
    Requires slow pace at first.
 Not a man in England
    Can advise me like you; be to yourself
    As you would to your friend.
 Be advis'd:  
    Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
    That it do singe yourself.
 We may outrun
    By violent swiftness that which we run at,
    And lose by over-running.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Sir,
    I am thankful to you, and I'll go along
    By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow-
    Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but
    From sincere motions, by intelligence,
    And proofs as clear as founts in July when
    We see each grain of gravel-I do know
    To be corrupt and treasonous.
 To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong  
    As shore of rock.
 Attend: this holy fox,
    Or wolf, or both-for he is equal rav'nous
    As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
    As able to perform't, his mind and place
    Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-
    Only to show his pomp as well in France
    As here at home, suggests the King our master
    To this last costly treaty, th' interview
    That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
    Did break i' th' wrenching.
 Let the King know,
    As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal
    Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
    And for his own advantage.
 Your office, sergeant: execute it.
 Sir,
    My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
    Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
    Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
    Of our most sovereign King.
 I am sorry
    To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
    The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure
    You shall to th' Tower.

    [To ABERGAVENNY]  The King
    Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know
    How he determines further.
 As the Duke said,
    The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure
    By me obey'd.
 A monk o' th' Chartreux.

  QUEEN KATHARINE.

  KING.
 This makes bold mouths;
    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
    Allegiance in them; their curses now
    Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass
    This tractable obedience is a slave
    To each incensed will.
 I would your Highness
    Would give it quick consideration, for
    There is no primer business.
 By my life,
    This is against our pleasure.
 We must not stint  
    Our necessary actions in the fear
    To cope malicious censurers, which ever
    As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow
    That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
    Than vainly longing.
 What we oft do best,
    By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
    Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft
    Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
    For our best act.
 Sixth part of each?
    A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
    From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber;
    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
    The air will drink the sap.
 Pray, look tot;
    I put it to your care.

    Let there be letters writ to every shire
    Of the King's grace and pardon.
 The grieved commons
    Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd
    That through our intercession this revokement
    And pardon comes.
 Yet see,
    When these so noble benefits shall prove
    Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,
    They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
    Than ever they were fair.
 Sit by us; you shall hear-
    This was his gentleman in trust-of him
    Things to strike honour sad.
 Please your Highness, note
    This dangerous conception in this point:
    Not friended by his wish, to your high person
    His will is most malignant, and it stretches
    Beyond you to your friends.

  QUEEN KATHARINE.

  KING.

  KING.
 I say, take heed;
    Yes, heartily beseech you.

  KING.

    Go forward.
 Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
    There's mischief in this man.

  KING.
 Proceed.
'
  KING.
 A giant traitor!
  WOLSEY.
 He is attach'd;
    Call him to present trial.
 If he may
    Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none,  
    Let him not seek't of us.
 By day and night!
    He's traitor to th' height.
 The palace

Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 New customs,
    Though they be never so ridiculous,
    Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.

  CHAMBERLAIN.


           Enter SIR THOMAS LOVELL

    How now?
    What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?
  LOVELL.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 I am glad 'tis there.
 They must either,
    For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
    Of fool and feather that they got in France,
    With all their honourable points of ignorance
    Pertaining thereunto-as fights and fireworks;  
    Abusing better men than they can be,
    Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean
    The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,
    Short blist'red breeches, and those types of travel
    And understand again like honest men,
    Or pack to their old playfellows.

  CHAMBERLAIN.

  SANDYS.
 No, my lord,
    Nor shall not while I have a stamp.

  CHAMBERLAIN.

  SANDYS.
                                Exeunt




ACT I.


       Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDYS, and SIR
                  THOMAS LOVELL

    O, my lord, y'are tardy,  
    The very thought of this fair company
    Clapp'd wings to me.
 Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal
    But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
    Should find a running banquet ere they rested
    I think would better please 'em.
 By my life,
    They are a sweet society of fair ones.
 I would I were;
    They should find easy penance.
 Faith, how easy?
  SANDYS.
              [Kisses her]
  CHAMBERLAIN.
 This, to confirm my welcome-
    And to you all, good health!                             [Drinks]
  SANDYS.

    Ladies, you are not merry.

    Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,
    For 'tis to such a thing-
  ANNE.

  SANDYS.
 Look out there, some of ye.
 Some attend him.
 Enter the KING, and others, as maskers,
      habited like shepherds, usher'd by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
 Such a one, they all confess,
    There is indeed; which they would have your Grace
    Find out, and he will take it.
  
  KING.
 I am glad
    Your Grace is grown so pleasant.
 Yes, my lord.

ACT II.
 SCENE 1.
 A street

Enter two GENTLEMEN, at several doors

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Whither away so fast?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 Pray, speak what has happen'd.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 That was he
    That fed him with his prophecies?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 After all this, how did he bear him-self
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Sure, he does not;
    He never was so womanish; the cause
    He may a little grieve at.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 That trick of state  
    Was a deep envious one.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.

    But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.

    For further life in this world I ne'er hope
    Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies
    More than I dare make faults.
 Lead on, a God's name.
 I forgive all.
 Prepare there;
    The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready;
    And fit it with such furniture as suits
    The greatness of his person.
 I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.

    Heaven has an end in all.
 Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
    A strong faith to conceal it.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

    We are too open here to argue this;
    Let's think in private more.

    When they were ready to set out for London, a man of
    my Lord Cardinal's, by commission, and main power, took
    'em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv'd
    before a subject, if not before the King; which stopp'd
    our mouths, sir.
 Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.

  SUFFOLK.
 No, his conscience
    Has crept too near another lady.
 Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.
 Heaven will one day open
    The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon
    This bold bad man.

  SUFFOLK.
 And free us from his slavery.

  NORFOLK.
 All men's honours
    Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd  
    Into what pitch he please.

    My lord, you'll bear us company?
  CHAMBERLAIN.

                            Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws
                               the curtain and sits reading pensively
  SUFFOLK.
 Who's there, ha?
  NORFOLK.

  KING HENRY.
 Our breach of duty this way
    Is business of estate, in which we come
    To know your royal pleasure.

  KING.

  KING.
  [To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]  We are busy; go.

  NORFOLK.

  NORFOLK.
  [Aside to NORFOLK]  I another.

    Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?
    The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
    Must now confess, if they have any goodness,  
    The trial just and noble.
 Rome the nurse of judgment,
    Invited by your noble self, hath sent
    One general tongue unto us, this good man,
    This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,
    Whom once more I present unto your Highness.
 Your Grace must needs deserve an strangers' loves,
    You are so noble.
 To your Highness' hand
    I tender my commission; by whose virtue-
    The court of Rome commanding-you, my Lord
    Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
    In the unpartial judging of this business.
                              Exit WOLSEY

          Re-enter WOLSEY with GARDINER

  WOLSEY.
  [Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand: much
      joy and favour to you;
    You are the King's now.
  [Aside to WOLSEY]  But to be commanded
    For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.

  KING.
 He was a fool,
    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,
    If I command him, follows my appointment.
 Deliver this with modesty to th' Queen.
 SCENE 3.

  ANNE.
 O, God's will! much better
    She ne'er had known pomp; though't be temporal,
    Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce  
    It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
    As soul and body's severing.
 Alas, poor lady!
    She's a stranger now again.

  OLD LADY.
 No, not for all the riches under heaven.

  OLD LADY.
 In faith, for little England
    You'd venture an emballing.
 My good lord,
    Not your demand; it values not your asking.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings
    Follow such creatures.

  OLD LADY.
 How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.
 Come, you are pleasant.
 Say,
    Are you not stronger than you were?
  ANNE.

    The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
    In our long absence.

  OLD LADY.
 Enter two VERGERS, with short silver wands;
next them, two SCRIBES, in the habit of doctors; after them,
the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY alone; after him, the BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY,
ROCHESTER, and SAINT ASAPH; next them, with some small distance,
follows a GENTLEMAN bearing the purse, with the great seal,
and a Cardinal's hat; then two PRIESTS, bearing each silver cross;
then a GENTLEMAN USHER bareheaded, accompanied with a SERGEANT-AT-ARMS
bearing a silver mace; then two GENTLEMEN bearing two great silver pillars;
after them, side by side, the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS;
two NOBLEMEN with the sword and mace.
 What's the need?
    It hath already publicly been read,
    And on all sides th' authority allow'd;
    You may then spare that time.
 Henry King of England, &c.

  SCRIBE.
'
  CRIER.


     The QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair,
     goes about the court, comes to the KING, and kneels  
     at his feet; then speaks

  QUEEN KATHARINE.
 If, in the course
    And process of this time, you can report,
    And prove it too against mine honour, aught,
    My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,
    Against your sacred person, in God's name,
    Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt
    Shut door upon me, and so give me up
    To the sharp'st kind of justice.
 You have here, lady,
    And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men
    Of singular integrity and learning,
    Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are assembled
    To plead your cause.
 His Grace
    Hath spoken well and justly; therefore, madam,
    It's fit this royal session do proceed
    And that, without delay, their arguments
    Be now produc'd and heard.

  WOLSEY.
 I Will, when you are humble; nay, before
    Or God will punish me.
 The Queen is obstinate,
    Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
    Disdainful to be tried by't; 'tis not well.

  KING.

    I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
    Upon this business my appearance make
    In any of their courts.
 Go thy ways, Kate.
 Thou art, alone-
    If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
    Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
    Obeying in commanding, and thy parts  
    Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out-
    The queen of earthly queens.
 Y'are excus'd.

    But will you be more justified? You ever
    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd
    It to be stirr'd; but oft have hind'red, oft,
    The passages made toward it.
 On my honour,
    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
    And thus far clear him.
 I' th' progress of this business,
    Ere a determinate resolution, he-
    I mean the Bishop-did require a respite  
    Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
    Whether our daughter were legitimate,
    Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
    Sometimes our brother's wife.
 So please your Highness,
    The question did at first so stagger me-
    Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
    And consequence of dread-that I committed
    The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,  
    And did entreat your Highness to this course
    Which you are running here.
 I then mov'd you,
    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
    To make this present summons.

    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
    Prithee return.
, AND IS
PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF ILLINOIS BENEDICTINE COLLEGE
WITH PERMISSION.
 My soul grows
      sad with troubles;
    Sing and disperse 'em, if thou canst.
 How now?
  GENTLEMAN.
 If your business
    Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
    Out with it boldly; truth loves open dealing.
 Noble lady,
    I am sorry my integrity should breed,
    And service to his Majesty and you,
    So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant
    We come not by the way of accusation
    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
    Nor to betray you any way to sorrow-
    You have too much, good lady; but to know
    How you stand minded in the weighty difference
    Between the King and you, and to deliver,
    Like free and honest men, our just opinions
    And comforts to your cause.
  [Aside]  To betray me.
 I was set at work
    Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking
    Either for such men or such business.
 Put your main cause into the King's protection;
    He's loving and most gracious.

  WOLSEY.
 He tells you rightly.
 The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye,
    Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
    But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.

    Mend 'em, for shame, my lords.

  WOLSEY.
 Madam, this is a mere distraction;
    You turn the good we offer into envy.

  QUEEN KATHARINE.

  CAMPEIUS.
 The King loves you;
    Beware you lose it not.

    Pray do my service to his Majesty;
    He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers
    While I shall have my life.
 Come, reverend fathers,
    Bestow your counsels on me; she now begs
    That little thought, when she set footing here,
    She should have bought her dignities so dear.
SCENE 2.

  SURREY.
 I am joyful
    To meet the least occasion that may give me
    Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke,
    To be reveng'd on him.
 Which of the peers
    Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
    Strangely neglected? When did he regard
    The stamp of nobleness in any person
    Out of himself?  
  CHAMBERLAIN.
 My lords, you speak your pleasures.

  SURREY.
 How came  
    His practices to light?
  SUFFOLK.
 Will this work?
  CHAMBERLAIN.
 The King in this perceives him how he coasts
    And hedges his own way.

  SURREY.
 Would he had!
  SUFFOLK.
 May you be happy in your wish, my lord!  
    For, I profess, you have it.

  SURREY.
 But, my lord,
    When returns Cranmer?
  SUFFOLK.
 Shortly, I believe,
    His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
    Her coronation.
 He has; and we shall see him  
    For it an archbishop.

  WOLSEY.
 Leave me awhile.
 'Tis I must snuff it;
    Then out it goes.
 Again, there is sprung up
    An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
    Hath crawl'd into the favour of the King,
    And is his oracle.


        Enter the KING, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL

  SURREY.
 In most strange postures
    We have seen him set himself.

                        [The KING takes his seat and whispers LOVELL,
                                           who goes to the CARDINAL]
  WOLSEY.

  WOLSEY.
  [Aside]  What should this mean?
  SURREY.
 Fairly answer'd!
    A loyal and obedient subject is
    Therein illustrated; the honour of it  
    Does pay the act of it, as, i' th' contrary,
    The foulness is the punishment.

  WOLSEY.
 What should this mean?
    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-
    Then makes him nothing.
 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me.
 Now I feel
    Of what coarse metal ye are moulded-envy;
    How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
    As if it fed ye; and how sleek and wanton
    Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
    Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
    You have Christian warrant for 'em, and no doubt
    In time will find their fit rewards.
 Now, who'll take it?
  SURREY.

  SURREY.
 Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
 All goodness  
    Is poison to thy stomach.

    My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
    As you respect the common good, the state
    Of our despis'd nobility, our issues,
    Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen-
    Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
    Collected from his life.
 Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand;
    But, thus much, they are foul ones.

  SURREY.

  SUFFOLK.
 This is my charge.

  NORFOLK.
 So farewell to the little good you bear me.

    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;  
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do.
 My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
 O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.


         Enter CROMWELL, standing amazed  

    Why, how now, Cromwell!
  CROMWELL.

  WOLSEY.
 I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
 I am able now, methinks,  
    Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
    To endure more miseries and greater far
    Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
 That's somewhat sudden.

    But he's a learned man.

  WOLSEY.
 That's news indeed.

  CROMWELL.
 Last, that the Lady Anne,  
    Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,
    This day was view'd in open as his queen,
    Going to chapel; and the voice is now
    Only about her coronation.

      O Cromwell,
    The King has gone beyond me.
 All my glories
    In that one woman I have lost for ever.
 Good Cromwell,
    Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
    For thine own future safety.
 Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
    In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me,
    Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.

    Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,
    And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
    And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
    Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee-
    Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in-
    A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.

  CROMWELL.
 Good sir, have patience.

  WOLSEY.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 So are you.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 At our last encounter
    The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
 Never greater,  
    Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 You may read the rest.
 I thank you, sir; had I not known
      those customs,
    I should have been beholding to your paper.
 That I can tell you too.
 The Archbishop
    Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
    Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
    Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles of
    From Ampthill, where the Princess lay; to which
    She was often cited by them, but appear'd not.
  
    And, to be short, for not appearance and
    The King's late scruple, by the main assent
    Of all these learned men, she was divorc'd,
    And the late marriage made of none effect;
    Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
    Where she remains now sick.
 Alas, good lady!                       [Trumpets]
    The trumpets sound.
 A lively flourish of trumpets.
 LORD CHANCELLOR, with purse and mace before him.

 MARQUIS DORSET, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a  
       demi-coronal of gold.
 Collars of Esses.

    8.
 These know.
  
    Who's that that bears the sceptre?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 It is; and all the rest are countesses.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 The rich stream
    Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen
    To a prepar'd place in the choir, fell of
    A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
    To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
    In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
    The beauty of her person to the people.
 Such joy
    I never saw before.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.

  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 Who may that be, I pray you?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 Thomas Cromwell,
    A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
    A worthy friend.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
  
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 Yes, without all doubt.
 You may command us, sir.
                               Exeunt




ACT IV.
 Reach a chair.

    Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
    That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
    Was dead?
  GRIFFITH.
 Yes, madam; but I think your Grace,
    Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.

    If well, he stepp'd before me, happily,
    For my example.
 At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
    Lodg'd in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
    With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him;
    To whom he gave these words: 'O father Abbot,
    An old man, broken with the storms of state,
    Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
    Give him a little earth for charity!'
    So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
    Pursu'd him still And three nights after this,
    About the hour of eight-which he himself
    Foretold should be his last-full of repentance,
    Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
    He gave his honours to the world again,
    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
 May it please your Highness
    To hear me speak his good now?
  KATHARINE.
 Yes, good Griffith;
    I were malicious else.

    And though he were unsatisfied in getting-
    Which was a sin-yet in bestowing, madam,
    He was most princely: ever witness for him
    Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you,
    Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,
    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
    The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
    So excellent in art, and still so rising,
    That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.

    His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
    And found the blessedness of being little.

    And, to add greater honours to his age  
    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.
 The music continues

  KATHARINE.
 Madam, we are here.

  KATHARINE.
                    [Music ceases]
  PATIENCE.
 Do you note
    How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden?
    How long her face is drawn! How pale she looks,
    And of an earthly cold! Mark her eyes.

  GRIFFITH.
 I humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon;
    My haste made me unmannerly.
 There is staying
    A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
 Admit him entrance, Griffith; but this fellow
    Let me ne'er see again.
 O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,
    'Tis like a pardon after execution:
    That gentle physic, given in time, had cur'd me;
    But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.
 Most willing, madam.

    If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life
    And able means, we had not parted thus.
 Tell him in death I bless'd him,
    For so I will.
 It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
  BOY.
 These should be hours for necessities,
    Not for delights; times to repair our nature
    With comforting repose, and not for us
    To waste these times.
 I must to him too,
    Before he go to bed.
 But, sir, sir-
    Hear me, Sir Thomas.
 Now, sir, you speak of two
    The most remark'd i' th' kingdom.
 As for Cromwell,
    Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master
    O' th' Rolls, and the King's secretary; further, sir,
    Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,
    With which the time will load him.
 Many good nights, my lord; I rest your servant.
 I could not personally deliver to her
    What you commanded me, but by her woman
    I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
    In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your Highness
    Most heartily to pray for her.
 So said her woman; and that her suff'rance made
    Almost each pang a death.
 God safely quit her of her burden, and
    With gentle travail, to the gladding of
    Your Highness with an heir!
  KING.
 Leave me alone,
    For I must think of that which company
    Will not be friendly to.

  KING.

  KING.
 'Tis true.

  KING.


         Re-enter DENNY, With CRANMER

  KING.
 All's not well.

    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
    And am right sorry to repeat what follows.

  KING.
 Be of good cheer;
    They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
 God's blest Mother!
    I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul
    None better in my kingdom.
 I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
    Will make my boldness manners.
 Is the Queen deliver'd?
    Say ay, and of a boy.

  OLD LADY.
 Ay, ay, my liege;
    And of a lovely boy.

    I will have more, or scold it out of him.

ACT V.


Lobby before the Council Chamber

Enter CRANMER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

  CRANMER.
 I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman
    That was sent to me from the Council pray'd me
    To make great haste.
 All fast? What means this? Ho!
    Who waits there? Sure you know me?

           Enter KEEPER

  KEEPER.
 I am glad  
    I came this way so happily; the King
    Shall understand it presently.
 But their pleasures
    Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
 What's that, Butts?
  BUTTS.
 Enter LORD CHANCELLOR, places himself at the upper end
of the table on the left band, a seat being left void above him,
as for Canterbury's seat.
 DUKE OF SUFFOLK, DUKE OF NORFOLK, SURREY,
LORD CHAMBERLAIN, GARDINER, seat themselves in order on each side;
CROMWELL at lower end, as secretary.

  GARDINER.
 My Lord Archbishop;
    And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.
 Let him come in.
 My good Lord Archbishop, I am very sorry
    To sit here at this present, and behold
    That chair stand empty; but we all are men,
    In our own natures frail and capable
    Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty
    And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
    Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
    Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling
    The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains-
    For so we are inform'd-with new opinions,
    Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
    And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

  GARDINER.

  CROMWELL.
 Would you were half so honest!
    Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

  CROMWELL.

  CROMWELL.
 Are you all agreed, lords?  
  ALL.

    Let some o' th' guard be ready there.
 Stay, good my lords,
    I have a little yet to say.
 I told ye all,
    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
    'Twould fall upon ourselves.

  KING.

  CHANCELLOR.
 You
      shall have
    Two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk
    And Lady Marquis Dorset.
 SCENE 4.
 Enter PORTER and his MAN

  PORTER.

    [Within: Good master porter, I belong to th' larder.

    We may as well push against Paul's as stir 'em.
 I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.
 The spoons will be the bigger, sir.
 An't please your honour,
    We are but men; and what so many may do,
    Not being torn a pieces, we have done.
 As I live,
    If the King blame me for't, I'll lay ye an
    By th' heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
    Clap round fines for neglect.
 You great fellow,
    Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.
 SCENE 5.
 The troop pass once about the stage,
and GARTER speaks

  GARTER.

  CRANMER.

  KING.
 So shall this lady,
    When she has so much English.
 She shall be-
    But few now living can behold that goodness-
    A pattern to all princes living with her,
    And all that shall succeed.
 Saba was never
    More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
    Than this pure soul shall be.
 Truth shall nurse her,
    Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her;
    She shall be lov'd and fear'd.

    God shall be truly known; and those about her
    From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,  
    And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
 She shall be, to the happiness of England,  
    An aged princess; many days shall see her,
    And yet no day without a deed to crown it.

  KING.
 Some come to take their ease
    And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
    W'have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,
    They'll say 'tis nought; others to hear the city
    Abus'd extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
    Which we have not done neither; that, I fear,
    All the expected good w'are like to hear
    For this play at this time is only in
    The merciful construction of good women;
    For such a one we show'd 'em.

KING JOHN's palace

Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others,
with CHATILLON

  KING JOHN.
 Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  CHATILLON.

  ELINOR.
 What follows if we disallow of this?
  CHATILLON.

  KING JOHN.
 Farewell, Chatillon.
 Shall I produce the men?
  KING JOHN.
 Let them approach.


     Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP, his bastard  
                     brother

    What men are you?
  BASTARD.

  KING JOHN.

  BASTARD.

  ELINOR.
 Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
    And wound her honour with this diffidence.
 Why, being younger born,
    Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
  BASTARD.

    If old Sir Robert did beget us both
    And were our father, and this son like him-
    O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
    I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
  KING JOHN.
 Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR.

    Th' advantage of his absence took the King,
    And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;
    Where how he did prevail I shame to speak-
    But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
    Between my father and my mother lay,  
    As I have heard my father speak himself,
    When this same lusty gentleman was got.

  KING JOHN.
 Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
    And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
    Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
    Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
  BASTARD.

    Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
    Yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.
 Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
    Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

  KING JOHN.

  BASTARD.

    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'  
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion.
 Where is that slave, thy brother?  
      Where is he
    That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
  BASTARD.
 James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  GURNEY.

  BASTARD.
 Philip-Sparrow! James,
    There's toys abroad-anon I'll tell thee more.

                                                          Exit GURNEY
    Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son;
    Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
    Upon Good Friday, and ne'er broke his fast.

    Sir Robert could do: well-marry, to confess-
    Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
    We know his handiwork.
 Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
    That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
    What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
  BASTARD.
 Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
  BASTARD.
 As faithfully as I deny the devil.

    Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
    Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
    Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence.

  BASTARD.

    Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
    And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;
    Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
    Subjected tribute to commanding love,
    Against whose fury and unmatched force
    The aweless lion could not wage the fight
    Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.

    Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
    And they shall say when Richard me begot,
    If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.
                 Exeunt

SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC.

    Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
    Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
    And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
    By this brave duke came early to his grave;
    And for amends to his posterity,
    At our importance hither is he come
    To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf;
    And to rebuke the usurpation
    Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.

    Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
 A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
  AUSTRIA.
 Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
    As seal to this indenture of my love:
    That to my home I will no more return
    Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
    Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore,
    Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
    And coops from other lands her islanders-
    Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,
    That water-walled bulwark, still secure
    And confident from foreign purposes-
    Even till that utmost corner of the west
    Salute thee for her king.
 O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
    Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
    To make a more requital to your love!
  AUSTRIA.

  KING PHILIP.

  CONSTANCE.
 Stay for an answer to your embassy,
    Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;
    My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
    That right in peace which here we urge in war,
    And then we shall repent each drop of blood
    That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
 Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
    And stir them up against a mightier task.

    Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.

    Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face:
    These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;
    This little abstract doth contain that large
    Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
    Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.

    That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,
    Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
    And by whose help I mean to chastise it.

  ELINOR.
 My bed was ever to thy son as true
    As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
    Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
    Than thou and John in manners-being as Eke
    As rain to water, or devil to his dam.

  CONSTANCE.
 Peace!
  BASTARD.
 What the devil art thou?
  BASTARD.

  BLANCH.
 What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
    With this abundance of superfluous breath?
    King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.

    King John, this is the very sum of all:
    England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
    In right of Arthur, do I claim of thee;
    Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
  KING JOHN.
 Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
    His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
    Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
    Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
    Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd
    To do him justice and revenge on you.
 Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
  CONSTANCE.

  KING JOHN.

  CONSTANCE.
 'Tis France, for England.
 England for itself.

  KING JOHN.

  CITIZEN.
 Bastards and else.
 Some bastards too.

  BASTARD.

  BASTARD.
 Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
    King John, your king and England's, doth approach,
    Commander of this hot malicious day.

    Their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright
    Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood.

    Open your gates and give the victors way.


    Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several doors

  KING JOHN.

    Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
    Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
    You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
    Then let confusion of one part confirm
    The other's peace.
 Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
  KING PHILIP.
 A greater pow'r than we denies all this;  
    And till it be undoubted, we do lock
    Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
    King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolv'd,
    Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd.

    I'd play incessantly upon these jades,
    Even till unfenced desolation
    Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
 Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
    I like it well.
 Say, where will you assault?  
  KING JOHN.
 We from the west will send destruction
    Into this city's bosom.

  KING PHILIP.

    Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

  KING JOHN.

    He is the half part of a blessed man,
    Left to be finished by such as she;
    And she a fair divided excellence,
    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.

  CITIZEN.
 Why answer not the double majesties
    This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town?
  KING PHILIP.

    I do protest I never lov'd myself
    Till now infixed I beheld myself
    Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
  [Aside]  Drawn in the flattering table of her eye,
    Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,  
    And quarter'd in her heart-he doth espy
    Himself love's traitor.

  BLANCH.
 Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
  LEWIS.

 SCENE 1.
 I do beseech you, madam, be content.

    But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
    Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
    Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
    And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O!
    She is corrupted, chang'd, and won from thee;
    Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,  
    And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
    To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
    And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
 Pardon me, madam,
    I may not go without you to the kings.

    To solemnize this day the glorious sun
    Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
    Turning with splendour of his precious eye
    The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold.
  [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!
    What hath this day deserv'd? what hath it done
    That it in golden letters should be set
    Among the high tides in the calendar?
    Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
    This day of shame, oppression, perjury;
    Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
    Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,  
    Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd;
    But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
    No bargains break that are not this day made;
    This day, all things begun come to ill end,
    Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
  KING PHILIP.
 You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
    Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
    Proves valueless; you are forsworn, forsworn;
    You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
    But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
 What a fool art thou,
    A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
    Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
    Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
    Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
    Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength,
    And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
    Thou wear a lion's hide! Doff it for shame,
    And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
 O that a man should speak those words to me!
  BASTARD.

  AUSTRIA.
 What earthly name to interrogatories
    Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
    Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name
    So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous,
    To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.

  KING JOHN.

  CONSTANCE.
 There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
 And for mine too; when law can do no right,  
    Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong;
    Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
    For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
    Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
    How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  PANDULPH.

  ELINOR.
 Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
  CONSTANCE.
 Bethink you, father; for the difference  
    Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
    Or the light loss of England for a friend.

  KING PHILIP.
 What motive may
    Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
  CONSTANCE.

  CONSTANCE.

  BASTARD.

    Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose:
    Assured loss before the match be play'd.

  LEWIS.
 There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

  BASTARD.
 My lord, I rescued her;
    Her Highness is in safety, fear you not;
    But on, my liege, for very little pains
    Will bring this labour to an happy end.


France.
  [To ELINOR]  So shall it be; your Grace shall stay
      behind,
    So strongly guarded.
  [To ARTHUR]  Cousin, look not sad;
    Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will
    As dear be to thee as thy father was.
 Grandam, I will pray,
    If ever I remember to be holy,
    For your fair safety.

  KING JOHN.

    Give me thy hand.

  HUBERT.

  KING JOHN.
 If the midnight bell
    Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
    Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
    If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
    And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
    Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
    Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
    Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
    Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
    And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
    A passion hateful to my purposes;
    Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
    Hear me without thine cars, and make reply
    Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
    Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words-  
    Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
    I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.

  KING JOHN.
 And I'll keep him so
    That he shall not offend your Majesty.

  KING JOHN.

  HUBERT.

  ELINOR.
 What can go well, when we have run so ill.

    Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
    Arthur ta'en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?
    And bloody England into England gone,
    O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
  LEWIS.

  CONSTANCE.
 Misery's love,
    O, come to me!
  KING PHILIP.

  PANDULPH.
 To England, if you will.

  KING PHILIP.

  CONSTANCE.
 Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
    I tore them from their bonds, and cried aloud
    'O that these hands could so redeem my son,  
    As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
    But now I envy at their liberty,
    And will again commit them to their bonds,
    Because my poor child is a prisoner.
 You hold too heinous a respect of grief.

  CONSTANCE.
  
  KING PHILIP.
 There's nothing in this world can make me joy.

    Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner?
  LEWIS.

  LEWIS.
 And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.

  PANDULPH.
 'Tis wonderful
    What may be wrought out of their discontent,
    Now that their souls are topful of offence.
 Strong reasons makes strong actions.

Enter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS

  HUBERT.
 Look to't.

  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR.
  
  HUBERT.

  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR.

  ARTHUR.

    Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
    And call it cunning.
 Will you put out mine eyes,
    These eyes that never did nor never shall
    So much as frown on you?
  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR.


     Re-enter EXECUTIONERS, With cord, irons, etc.
 Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
    I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.

    For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
    Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,
    And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
    I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
    Nor look upon the iron angrily;
    Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,  
    Whatever torment you do put me to.
 Is there no remedy?
  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR.
 O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
    A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
    Any annoyance in that precious sense!
    Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,
    Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

    Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;  
    Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
    So I may keep mine eyes.
 O, spare mine eyes,
    Though to no use but still to look on you!
    Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold
    And would not harm me.

  HUBERT.
 See else yourself:
    There is no malice in this burning coal;
    The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,
    And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.

    Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,
    And, like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
    Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
 Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
    For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
 O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
    You were disguis'd.

    Much danger do I undergo for thee.

  SALISBURY.
 When workmen strive to do better than well,
    They do confound their skill in covetousness;
    And oftentimes excusing of a fault
    Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,
    As patches set upon a little breach
    Discredit more in hiding of the fault
    Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.

  KING JOHN.

    His passion is so ripe it needs must break.

  KING JOHN.

    Good lords, although my will to give is living,
    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
    He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.
 Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
    Before the child himself felt he was sick.
  
    So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
            Exeunt LORDS
  KING JOHN.
 They burn in indignation.

    There is no sure foundation set on blood,
    No certain life achiev'd by others' death.
 Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
    O, make a league with me, till I have pleas'd
    My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
    How wildly then walks my estate in France!
    Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France
    That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?  
  MESSENGER.

  BASTARD.
 Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
    Under the tide; but now I breathe again
    Aloft the flood, and can give audience
    To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

  KING JOHN.
 Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
    And on that day at noon whereon he says
    I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd.

    Deliver him to safety; and return,
    For I must use thee.
 The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
    Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
    With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,  
    And others more, going to seek the grave
    Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
    On your suggestion.

  BASTARD.

  KING JOHN.
 Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
 My mother dead!

                   Re-enter HUBERT

  HUBERT.

  KING JOHN.

    I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
    With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;  
    Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
    Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
    Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
    Told of a many thousand warlike French
    That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
 I had a mighty cause
    To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
  
  KING JOHN.

  HUBERT.
 My lord-
  KING JOHN.

    But thou didst understand me by my signs,
    And didst in signs again parley with sin;
    Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
    And consequently thy rude hand to act
    The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
 This hand of mine
    Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
    Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.

    Within this bosom never ent'red yet
    The dreadful motion of a murderous thought  
    And you have slander'd nature in my form,
    Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
    Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
    Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

    I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.


England.

    I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.

    If I get down and do not break my limbs,
    I'll find a thousand shifts to get away.

    As good to die and go, as die and stay.
 Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
  SALISBURY.


                 Enter the BASTARD

  BASTARD.
 Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
    The King by me requests your presence straight.

    We will not line his thin bestained cloak
    With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
    That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
 Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
  
  BASTARD.

  SALISBURY.
 Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
    Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

  BASTARD.

  SALISBURY.

  PEMBROKE.
 O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
    Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
  HUBERT.

  SALISBURY.

    Yet I am none.
 Whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
    Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
 Cut him to pieces.

  BASTARD.
 Keep the peace, I say.

  BASTARD.
 What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
    Second a villain and a murderer?
  HUBERT.
 Who kill'd this prince?
  HUBERT.
 'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
 Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
    Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
    Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
    Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
 Ha! I'll tell thee what:  
    Thou'rt damn'd as black-nay, nothing is so black-
    Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer;
    There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
    As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

  HUBERT.

 SCENE 1.

    Then pause not; for the present time's so sick
    That present med'cine must be minist'red  
    Or overthrow incurable ensues.
 It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
    Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope;
    But since you are a gentle convertite,
    My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
    And make fair weather in your blust'ring land.
                 Exit
  KING JOHN.
 Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
    Say that before Ascension-day at noon
    My crown I should give off? Even so I have.
 All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
    But Dover Castle.
  
    Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
    To offer service to your enemy;
    And wild amazement hurries up and down
    The little number of your doubtful friends.
 They found him dead, and cast into the streets,
    An empty casket, where the jewel of life
    By some damn'd hand was robbed and ta'en away.

  KING JOHN.

    But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?
    Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
    Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
    Govern the motion of a kingly eye.
 Have thou the ordering of this present time.

    My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
    Being an ordinary inundation;
    But this effusion of such manly drops,
    This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul,
    Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
    Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
    Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.

    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
    Into the purse of rich prosperity
    As Lewis himself.
 Hail, noble prince of France!
    The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd
    Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
    That so stood out against the holy Church,  
    The great metropolis and see of Rome.
 Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
    I am too high-born to be propertied,
    To be a secondary at control,
    Or useful serving-man and instrument
    To any sovereign state throughout the world.

    To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
    To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
    To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
    To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
    To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
    In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
    Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
    Thinking this voice an armed Englishman-
    Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
    That in your chambers gave you chastisement?  
    No.

  LEWIS.
 Fare thee well;
    We hold our time too precious to be spent
    With such a brabbler.

  BASTARD.
  
  BASTARD.
 Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
    And so shall you, being beaten.
 And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.

    Exeunt




SCENE 3.
 The field of battle

Alarums.

  HUBERT.
 Be of good comfort; for the great supply
    That was expected by the Dauphin here
    Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands;
    This news was brought to Richard but even now.


England.

  PEMBROKE.
 They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.

  SALISBURY.

    Commend me to one Hubert, with your King;
    The love of him-and this respect besides,
    For that my grandsire was an Englishman-
    Awakes my conscience to confess all this.

    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
    For I do see the cruel pangs of death
    Right in thine eye.
 O, bravely came we off,
    When with a volley of our needless shot,
    After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
    And wound our tott'ring colours clearly up,
    Last in the field and almost lords of it!

                 Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.
 Here; what news?
  MESSENGER.
 keep good quarter and good care to-night;
    The day shall not be up so soon as I
    To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
 A friend.
 Whither dost thou go?
  HUBERT.

  HUBERT.
 Thou hast a perfect thought.
 O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
    Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
 How did he take it; who did taste to him?
  HUBERT.


The orchard at Swinstead Abbey

Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT

  PRINCE HENRY.

    Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
    Doth by the idle comments that it makes
    Foretell the ending of mortality.
  
  PRINCE HENRY.

    Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
    Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
    Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
    With many legions of strange fantasies,
    Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
    Confound themselves.

    I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
    Upon a parchment, and against this fire
    Do I shrink up.

  PRINCE HENRY.

    Within me is a hell; and there the poison  
    Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize
    On unreprievable condemned blood.

  BASTARD.

    What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
    When this was now a king, and now is clay?
  BASTARD.
 I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
    And knows not how to do it but with tears.

    This England never did, nor never shall,
    Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
    But when it first did help to wound itself.

ACT I.


Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.


  FLAVIUS.
 Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.

  FLAVIUS.
 Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I
    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with
    awl.

  FLAVIUS.
 Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
    into more work.

    See whether their basest metal be not moved;
    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.

    Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
    This way will I.

  FLAVIUS.

  CAESAR.
 Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
    When he doth run his course.
 Forget not in your speed, Antonio,
    To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
    The barren, touched in this holy chase,
    Shake off their sterile curse.

  CASSIUS.

  CAESAR.

  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
  BRUTUS.
 No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
    But by reflection, by some other things.

  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 What means this shouting? I do fear the people
    Choose Caesar for their king.
 I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.

    For let the gods so speed me as I love
    The name of honor more than I fear death.
 Ye gods! It doth amaze me
    A man of such a feeble temper should
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone.

  BRUTUS.
 I will do so.

  CASSIUS.
 Antonio!
  ANTONY.
 Let me have men about me that are fat,
    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.

  ANTONY.
 Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
    He is a noble Roman and well given.
 Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca.

  CASCA.
 Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
     he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the
     people fell ashouting.
  
  BRUTUS.
 Why, for that too.
 I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it.
 He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
    speechless.
 An had been a man of any
    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I  
    might go to hell among the rogues.
 Ay.
 To what effect?
  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.
 Do so, farewell, both.
                            Exit.
 What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
    He was quick mettle when he went to school.
 Till then, think of the world.
 Good even, Casca.
 Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
    To be exalted with the threatening clouds,
    But never till tonight, never till now,
    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
 When these prodigies
    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
    "These are their reasons; they are natural":
    For I believe they are portentous things
    Unto the climate that they point upon.
 Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.

    But men may construe things after their fashion,
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
 Good then, Casca.
 Farewell, Cicero.

    For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
    Submitting me unto the perilous night,
    And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;
    And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open  
    The breast of heaven, I did present myself
    Even in the aim and very flash of it.

    But if you would consider the true cause
    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
    Why old men, fools, and children calculate,
    Why all these things change from their ordinance,
    Their natures, and preformed faculties
    To monstrous quality, why, you shall find
    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
    To make them instruments of fear and warning  
    Unto some monstrous state.
 Let it be who it is, for Romans now
    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.

  CASCA.
  
    Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
 So can I.
 But I am arm'd,
    And dangers are to me indifferent.

  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.

    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch.

  CASSIUS.
 Be you content.

    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
  CINNA.
 Him and his worth and our great need of him
    You have right well conceited.

 What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day.
 Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.


  LUCIUS.
 Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS.
                                 Exit.
 It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general.
 Crown him that,  
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.

    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason.
 So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent.
 And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
 Get you to bed again, it is not day.

    Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
  LUCIUS.

                                     Opens the letter and reads.
 Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
 'Tis good.

                                                    Exit Lucius.

    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is  
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.


                         Re-enter Lucius.
 Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
    Who doth desire to see you.
 Let 'em enter.

    They are the faction.
 Yes, every man of them, and no man here
    But honors you, and every one doth wish
    You had but that opinion of yourself
    Which every noble Roman bears of you.
 He is welcome hither.

  BRUTUS.
 They are all welcome.
 Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA.

    Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
    Which is a great way growing on the south,
    Weighing the youthful season of the year.

    Some two months hence up higher toward the north
    He first presents his fire, and the high east
    Stands as the Capitol, directly here.
 But if these,
    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
    What need we any spur but our own cause
    To prick us to redress? What other bond
    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
    And will not palter? And what other oath
    Than honesty to honesty engaged
    That this shall be or we will fall for it?
    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
    The even virtue of our enterprise,  
    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
    To think that or our cause or our performance
    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
    Is guilty of a several bastardy
    If he do break the smallest particle
    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

  CASSIUS.
 Let us not leave him out.

  METELLUS.

  CASCA.

  BRUTUS.
 This shall make
    Our purpose necessary and not envious,
    Which so appearing to the common eyes,
    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.

    And that were much he should, for he is given
    To sports, to wildness, and much company.
 Peace, count the clock.
 The clock hath stricken three.
 But it is doubtful yet
    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
    For he is superstitious grown of late,
    Quite from the main opinion he held once
    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
 Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
 Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

    I wonder none of you have thought of him.

  BRUTUS.

    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
    Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
  
    I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
    And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.

  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS.
 I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.

    I have made strong proof of my constancy,
    Giving myself a voluntary wound
    Here in the thigh.
 O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.

    Leave me with haste.
 Now bid me run,
    And I will strive with things impossible,
    Yea, get the better of them.

  LIGARIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Follow me then.


  CAESAR.
 My lord?
  CAESAR.
 Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
    And bring me their opinions of success.
                                Exit.
 Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
    Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see  
    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
 There is one within,
    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
 Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.


    What say the augurers?
  SERVANT.

    Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
    They could not find a heart within the beast.
 The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
 Danger knows full well
    That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
 Alas, my lord,
    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.

  DECIUS.
 Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
    I come to fetch you to the Senate House.
 And you are come in very happy time
    To bear my greeting to the senators
    And tell them that I will not come today.
 Say he is sick.
 Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
    Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
 And this way have you well expounded it.

  DECIUS.
"
    If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
    "Lo, Caesar is afraid"?  
    Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
    To your proceeding bids me tell you this,
    And reason to my love is liable.
 How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
    I am ashamed I did yield to them.


         Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,
                     Trebonius, and Cinna.
 Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
  

                           Enter Antony.

  TREBONIUS.
 [Aside.


  ARTEMIDORUS.
           Exit.





SCENE IV.


Enter Portia and Lucius.


                     Enter the Soothsayer.
 Madam, not yet.
 Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
  SOOTHSAYER.
 Brutus hath a suit
    That Caesar will not grant.

ACT III.

  ARTEMIDORUS.
 O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit
    That touches Caesar nearer.
 Read it, great Caesar.

  ARTEMIDORUS.
 Sirrah, give place.

  CASSIUS.
 Casca,
    Be sudden, for we fear prevention.

  CASSIUS.

  DECIUS.
                                     Kneels.

    Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
    Will he be satisfied.

  METELLUS.

  CAESAR.
 What, Brutus?
  CASSIUS.
 I could be well moved, if I were as you;
    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;
    But I am constant as the northern star,
    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
    There is no fellow in the firmament.

    So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,
    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
    Yet in the number I do know but one
    That unassailable holds on his rank,
    Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,
    Let me a little show it, even in this;
    That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
    And constant do remain to keep him so.
 O Caesar-
  CAESAR.
 Speak, hands, for me!
                        Casca first, then the other Conspirators
                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.
 People and senators, be not affrighted,
    Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.

  CASCA.
 Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

  DECIUS.
 Publius, good cheer,
    There is no harm intended to your person,
    Nor to no Roman else.
 So tell them, Publius.
 Fates, we will know your pleasures.

    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
    And drawing days out that men stand upon.
 Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

  BRUTUS.

  DECIUS.
 What, shall we forth?
  CASSIUS.
 Ay, every man away.

    Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

  BRUTUS.
 But here comes Antony.

  BRUTUS.
 For your part,
    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
    Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

    Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?
    My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
    Either a coward or a flatterer.
 Or else were this a savage spectacle.

  ANTONY.

                                          Exeunt all but Antony.
  
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.

    Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
    Began to water.


  CITIZENS.
 Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
 I will hear Brutus speak.
 The noble Brutus is ascended.
 Believe me for mine honor, and have  
    respect to mine honor, that you may believe.
 Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than
    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I
    weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
    valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.
 None, Brutus, none.
 Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
 Peace, ho!
  BRUTUS.
 Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.

  THIRD CITIZEN.

  ANTONY.

                                           Goes into the pulpit.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 What does he say of Brutus?
  THIRD CITIZEN.
 He says, for Brutus' sake,
    He finds himself beholding to us all.
 This Caesar was a tyrant.

  ANTONY.
 Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
 Was this ambition?
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
    And sure he is an honorable man.

    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
    But here I am to speak what I do know.

    You all did love him once, not without cause;
    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
    O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason.
 Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
 If thou consider rightly of the matter,  
    Caesar has had great wrong.
 Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

    O masters! If I were disposed to stir
    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
    I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
    Who, you all know, are honorable men.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.

    You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
 Honorable men!
  ALL.
 They were villains, murtherers.

    Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
  ALL.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
  
  ALL.

    You all do know this mantle.
 Then burst his mighty heart,
    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,  
    Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 O noble Caesar!
  THIRD CITIZEN.
 O woeful day!
  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 We will be revenged.
 Stay, countrymen.
 We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with
    him.

    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
 I only speak right on;
    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
    Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,
    And bid them speak for me.
 Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.

    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
    Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.

  ALL.
 Peace, ho!  
  ANTONY.
 Pluck down benches.
 He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.

    He comes upon a wish.
 Be like they had some notice of the people,
    How I had moved them.


Enter Cinna the poet.
 I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
    And things unluckily charge my fantasy.


                        Enter Citizens.


  FIRST CITIZEN.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.
 For your dwelling, briefly.
 I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
 It is no matter, his name's Cinna.
 Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
  LEPIDUS.

  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.
 Brutus and Cassius
    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
    Therefore let our alliance be combined,
    Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
    And let us presently go sit in council,
    How covert matters may be best disclosed,
    And open perils surest answered.

  BRUTUS.
 A word, Lucilius,
    How he received you.

    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
    But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
    But when they should endure the bloody spur,
    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
    Sink in the trial.
 Hark, he is arrived.


                  Enter Cassius and his Powers.
 Stand!
  SECOND SOLDIER.
 Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
    And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
  CASSIUS.
 Pindarus,
    Bid our commanders lead their charges off  
    A little from this ground.

  BRUTUS.


  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
 Go to, you are not, Cassius.
  
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Away, slight man!
  CASSIUS.
 Is't possible?
  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS.

    I said, an elder soldier, not a better.

  CASSIUS.
 I durst not?
  BRUTUS.
 For your life you durst not.
 You have done that you should be sorry for.

  CASSIUS.
  
  BRUTUS.
 Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
    For Cassius is aweary of the world:
    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
    Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
    Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,
    To cast into my teeth.

    Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,
    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,
    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
    And straight is cold again.
 Hath Cassius lived
    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
    When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
  BRUTUS.
 O Brutus!
  BRUTUS.
 [Within.
 [Within.


      Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.

  CASSIUS.
 I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
 Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.

  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS.
 How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
    O insupportable and touching loss!
    Upon what sickness?
  BRUTUS.
 O ye immortal gods!

               Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.

  Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
 Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.

  CASSIUS.
 No more, I pray you.

  MESSALA.
 Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS.
 We must die, Messala.
 This it is:
    'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

  BRUTUS.

    The enemy, marching along by them,
    By them shall make a fuller number up,
    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
    From which advantage shall we cut him off
    If at Philippi we do face him there,
    These people at our back.

    On such a full sea are we now afloat,  
    And we must take the current when it serves,
    Or lose our ventures.

  CASSIUS.

    Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

    Farewell, good Messala;
    Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,
    Good night and good repose.
 O my dear brother!
    This was an ill beginning of the night.
 Good night, good brother.
 MESSALA.

                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.


               Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.

    Call Claudio and some other of my men,
    I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

  LUCIUS.
 Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS.
 I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
    It may be I shall raise you by and by
    On business to my brother Cassius.
 So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

  BRUTUS.

    It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
 Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
 Ay, my lord, an't please you.

  LUCIUS.
 I should not urge thy duty past thy might;  
    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
 I have slept, my lord, already.
 Art thou anything?  
    Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil
    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
    Speak to me what thou art.
 To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

  BRUTUS.
     Exit Ghost.

    Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.

  BRUTUS.
 My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

  BRUTUS.
 Sleep again, Lucius.
 Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
    And we will follow.

 Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it.
 They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
 Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
    Upon the left hand of the even field.

  ANTONY.


      March.
 They stand, and would have parley.

  OCTAVIUS.
 Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY.
 Not that we love words better, as you do.

  BRUTUS.
 Antony,
    The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
    And leave them honeyless.

  BRUTUS.
  
  OCTAVIUS.

  CASSIUS.
 Come, Antony, away!
    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
 Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.

  CASSIUS.
 [Stands forth.

    You know that I held Epicurus strong,
    And his opinion.
 Even so, Lucilius.
 Now, most noble Brutus,
    The gods today stand friendly that we may,
    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
    But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
 Come, ho! Away!           Exeunt.

    Ride, ride, Messala.


  CASSIUS.

  TITINIUS.

  CASSIUS.
 This hill is far enough.

  TITINIUS.
 Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
    And tell me what thou notest about the field.
 Come now, keep thine oath;
    Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
    That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.

  PINDARUS.
              Exit.
 What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA.
 Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
    Into his ears.
 Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
 Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,
                         and others.
 Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA.

  CATO.





SCENE IV.

Another part of the field.
 Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO.
 Yield, or thou diest.
] There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:
    Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.
 Here comes the general.

  ANTONY.
                           Exeunt.
 He is or ta'en or slain.
 Sit thee down, Clitus.
 Peace then, no words.

  BRUTUS.
 O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS.
 O Clitus!
  CLITUS.

  CLITUS.
 What says my lord?
  BRUTUS.
 Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
 Countrymen,
    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
    I found no man but he was true to me.

    I shall have glory by this losing day,
    More than Octavius and Mark Antony
    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.

    Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest
    That have but labor'd to attain this hour.

                            Alarum.
 Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"
  CLITUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Give me your hand first.
 Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,
                 Lucilius, and the Army.

  LUCILIUS.

    Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
  STRATO.
 I held the sword, and he did run on it.

    All the conspirators, save only he,
    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
    He only, in a general honest thought
    And common good to all, made one of them.

    His life was gentle, and the elements
    So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
    And say to all the world, "This was a man!"
  OCTAVIUS.

      Earl of Kent.

Scene: - Britain.



ACT I.
 Is not this your son, my lord?
  Glou.

  Kent.
 I cannot conceive you.

  Glou.

  Glou.
 But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than
     this, who yet is no dearer in my account.
 My Lord of Kent.
 He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.

     The King is coming.

  Glou.

  Lear.

  Lear.

  Lear.
 Speak again.
 I love your Majesty
     According to my bond; no more nor less.

     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
     To love my father all.
 Ay, good my lord.
 So young, and so untender?
  Cor.
 The barbarous Scythian,
     Or he that makes his generation messes
     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
     As thou my sometime daughter.
 Peace, Kent!
     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
 Royal Lear,
     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-
  Lear.
 What wouldst thou do, old man?
     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
     When majesty falls to folly.

  Lear.

  Lear.

  Lear.
 Away! By Jupiter,
     This shall not be revok'd.
 Fare thee well, King.

     [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
     That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds  
        approve,
     That good effects may spring from words of love.
 Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy; Attendants.


  Glou.
 I know no answer.
 Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
     Take her, or leave her?
  Bur.

  Lear.
 Sure her offence
     Must be of such unnatural degree
     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
     Must be a faith that reason without miracle
     Should never plant in me.
 Is it but this- a tardiness in nature
     Which often leaves the history unspoke
     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
     What say you to the lady? Love's not love
     When it is mingled with regards that stands
     Aloof from th' entire point.

  Bur.
 Royal Lear,
     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
     Duchess of Burgundy.
 Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.
 I am sorry then you have so lost a father
     That you must lose a husband.
 Peace be with Burgundy!
     Since that respects of fortune are his love,
     I shall not be his wife.
 Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.
 He always lov'd our  
     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
     off appears too grossly.

  Gon.

  Reg.
 Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
     of Kent's banishment.

     Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

                          Enter Gloucester.
 No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your
     pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
     itself.

  Edm.
 Let's see, let's see!
  Edm.

  Glou.
 It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the
     contents.

  Glou.
 Never, my lord.
 But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
 If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall
     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very
     evening.
 I would unstate
     myself to be in a due resolution.

  Glou.
 Love cools,
     friendship falls off, brothers divide.
 This villain of mine comes under the
     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from bias
     of nature; there's father against child.
 An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay
     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and  
     lecherous.
 The night gone by.
 Spake you with him?
  Edg.
 None at all.

  Edm.
 That's my fear.
 I pray you have a continent forbearance till
     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me
     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my
     lord speak.
 Brother, I advise you to the best.
 I am no honest man
     if there be any good meaning toward you.





Scene III.


Enter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald].

     His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
     On every trifle.
 Put on what weary negligence you please,
     You and your fellows.

     If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
     Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
     Not to be overrul'd.
 And let his knights have colder looks among you.


Enter Kent, [disguised].
 Now, banish'd Kent,
     If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
     So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
     Shall find thee full of labours.


  Lear.
 What art thou?
  Kent.
 You.

  Lear.
 What services canst thou do?
  Kent.

  Lear.
 How old art thou?
  Kent.
 Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to  
     dote on her for anything.
 Follow me; thou shalt serve me.
 He would not?
  Knight.
 I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for
     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.

  Lear.
 Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception.
 I will look further into't.
 Go you and tell my
     daughter I would speak with her.


     O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir.

  Kent.
 I thank thee, fellow.
 Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences.
]
  Lear.
 There's earnest of thy  
     service.
]

                             Enter Fool.
 Let me hire him too.
 Why, fool?
  Fool.
 Why, my boy?
  Fool.

     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.

  Lear.
 Do.
 Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave me
     nothing for't.
 [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land  
     comes to.
 No, lad; teach me.
   That lord that counsell'd thee
            To give away thy land,
          Come place him here by me-
            Do thou for him stand.

          The sweet and bitter fool
            Will presently appear;
          The one in motley here,
            The other found out there.

  Fool.
 And ladies too, they
     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be  
     snatching.
 I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters
     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down
     thine own breeches,
  
     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,
                  And I for sorrow sung,
                That such a king should play bo-peep
                  And go the fools among.
 An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.
 I had rather be
     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,
     nuncle.


                            Enter Goneril.
 Your name, fair gentlewoman?
  Gon.

     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
     That this our court, infected with their manners,
     Shows like a riotous inn.
 Be then desir'd
     By her that else will take the thing she begs  
     A little to disquantity your train,
     And the remainder that shall still depend
     To be such men as may besort your age,
     Which know themselves, and you.

  Gon.
 [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!  
     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
     That all particulars of duty know
     And in the most exact regard support
     The worships of their name.
]
     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
 Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
     But let his disposition have that scope
     That dotage gives it.
 I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
     To the great love I bear you -
  Gon.
- What, Oswald, ho!
     [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!
  Fool.
  

          A fox when one has caught her,
          And such a daughter,
          Should sure to the slaughter,
          If my cap would buy a halter.
 Well, you may fear too far.
 How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.

     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
 Well, well; th' event.


Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.

  Fool.

  Lear.

  Fool.
 Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
 Why?
  Fool.

  Lear.
 If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being
     old before thy time.
 Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.

  Fool.
 Scene I.


Enter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, meeting.

  Cur.
 And you, sir.
 You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the
     whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?
  Edm.
 Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes
     of Cornwall and Albany?
  Edm.

  Cur.
-
     Yield! Come before my father.
 Light, ho, here!
     Fly, brother.
 [Stabs his arm.
- Father, father!-
     Stop, stop! No help?

             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.
 What I should deny
     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
     My very character), I'ld turn it all
     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
     And thou must make a dullard of the world,
     If they not thought the profits of my death
     Were very pregnant and potential spurs
     To make thee seek it.
'
  Glou.


                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.


  Corn.
 O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
  Reg.
 What, did my father's godson seek your life?
     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?
  Glou.
  
     I have this present evening from my sister
     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions
     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,
     I'll not be there.
 Ay, my good lord.

     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
     Wherein we must have use of your advice.

     Your Graces are right welcome.
 Flourish.

  Osw.
 I' th' mire.
 Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.

  Kent.
 If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for
     me.
 Fellow, I know thee.
 What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me!
     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy heels
     before the King? [Draws his sword.
 Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and
     take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father.

  Kent.
 Keep peace, upon your lives!
     He dies that strikes again.
 What is your difference? Speak.
 You cowardly
     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.
 Ay, a tailor, sir.

  Corn.
 Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?  
  Osw.
 Why art thou angry?
  Kent.

     A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,
     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

  Corn.
 No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
 Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
 He that beguil'd you in a plain
     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,
     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.

  Kent.
 Sir, I am too old to learn.
 Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
     There shall he sit till noon.
 Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
  Kent.

  Glou.

  Corn.

Exit.
 I know 'tis from Cordelia,
     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time
     From this enormous state, seeking to give
     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,
     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold  
     This shameful lodging.

The open country.


  Edg.
 Whiles I may scape,
     I will preserve myself; and am bethought
     To take the basest and most poorest shape
     That ever penury, in contempt of man,
     Brought near to beast.


Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.

  Kent.
 No, I say.
 I say yea.

  Lear.
 By Jupiter, I swear no!
  Kent.

  Lear.

  Lear.

  Gent.
 We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no
     labouring i' th' winter.
 I
     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.

          But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
            And let the wise man fly.

          The knave turns fool that runs away;
            The fool no knave, perdy.

  Glou.

     Infirmity doth still neglect all office
     Whereto our health is bound.
- Death on my state! Wherefore
     Should be sit here? This act persuades me
     That this remotion of the Duke and her
     Is practice only.
 Give me my servant forth.

     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
     Now, presently.
 Bid them come forth and hear me,
     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
     Till it cry sleep to death.
                 Exit.
 O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
  Fool.
 She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with
     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that,
     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.

  Lear.
 I have hope
     You less know how to value her desert
     Than she to scant her duty.
 If, sir, perchance
     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,  
     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
     As clears her from all blame.

  Lear.
 My curses on her!
  Reg.
 Therefore I pray you
     That to our sister you do make return;
     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

  Lear.
          [Kneels.
 On my knees I beg
     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.
 Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.

     Return you to my sister.
 Fie, sir, fie!
  Lear.
 No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.

  Reg.
 Good sir, to th' purpose.
 This approves her letter,
     That she would soon be here.
 Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
     To keep base life afoot.
                 [Points at Oswald.

     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.

     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.

     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
     For your fit welcome.
 Give ear, sir, to my sister;
     For those that mingle reason with your passion
     Must be content to think you old, and so-
     But she knows what she does.
 To no more
     Will I give place or notice.

  Lear.

  Lear.
  
     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
     To follow in a house where twice so many
     Have a command to tend you?
  Reg.
 O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.

     Allow not nature more than nature needs,
     Man's life is cheap as beast's.

     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
     Against their father, fool me not so much
     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
     And let not women's weapons, water drops,
     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
     I will have such revenges on you both  
     That all the world shall- I will do such things-
     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.

     No, I'll not weep.

  Reg.

  Reg.

  
                          Enter Gloucester.

  Glou.
 Whither is he going?

ACT III.


Storm still.


  Kent.
 I know you.

  Kent.
 There is division
     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars
     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,
     Which are to France the spies and speculations
     Intelligent of our state.

  Gent.

Another part of the heath.
 Then let fall  
     Your horrible pleasure.
 No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
     I will say nothing.

  Kent.
 Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
     Love not such nights as these.
 The wrathful skies
     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
     And make them keep their caves.
 I am a man
     More sinn'd against than sinning.

     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
     That's sorry yet for thee.


  Lear.
 This is a brave night to cool a courtesan.

          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
          That going shall be us'd with feet.


  Glou.
 These injuries the King now bears will be revenged
     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to
     the King.
 Though I
     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old master
     must be relieved.

The heath.
 Wilt break my heart?
  Kent.
 I had rather break mine own.
 So 'tis to thee;
     But where the greater malady is fix'd,
     The lesser is scarce felt.
 When the mind's free,
     The body's delicate.
 Good my lord, enter here.
 But I'll go in.

                                                    Exit [Fool].
 Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led  
     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er
     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud
     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor.

     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?  
     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
     Those pelican daughters.

  Edg.
 What hast thou been?
  Edg.
 Wine lov'd
     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
 Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies.
 Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim
     in.
 Who's there? What is't you seek?
  Glou.


     Beware my follower.
 What, hath your Grace no better company?
  Edg.
 The prince of darkness is a gentleman!
     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
 Let me ask you one word in private.
 What a night 's this!
     I do beseech your Grace-
  Lear.
  
     Noble philosopher, your company.
 With him!
     I will keep still with my philosopher.

  Glou.

Gloucester's Castle.

  Edm.
 If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty
     business in hand.

  Corn.

  Edm.

                                                         Exeunt.
 I will
     piece out the comfort with what addition I can.

  Kent.
 All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.
 Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

  Lear.
 No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a
     mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
 The foul fiend bites my back.
  
  Lear.
 Now, you she-foxes!
  Edg.
 Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial,
     madam?

             Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.

  Kent.
 How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.
 [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,
     Sit you too.
 Arraign her first.
 I here take my oath before
     this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father.
 Come hither, mistress.

  Fool.
 Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market
     towns.

  Lear.

     So, so, so.
 So, so, so.

  Fool.
 And I'll go to bed at noon.
 Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.

  Glou.
                                         [Exit.
 Pluck out his eyes.

  Corn.
 Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.

                           Exeunt Goneril, [Edmund, and Oswald].

  Glou.

  Corn.

                                            [Servants bind him.
 By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
     To pluck me by the beard.
 So white, and such a traitor!
  Glou.
 Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.

  Glou.
 I have a letter guessingly set down,
     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
     And not from one oppos'd.

  Corn.
 Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
  Corn.
 Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
 I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
'
     All cruels else subscrib'd.
 But I shall see
     The winged vengeance overtake such children.

     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
 If you see vengeance-
  1.
  
  Reg.
 Give me thy sword.
 Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
     His way to Dover.
 I have receiv'd a hurt.
 Give me your arm.
 I'll never care what wickedness I do,
     If this man come to good.
 Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam
     To lead him where he would.

The heath.
 Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd.
 I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
     I stumbled when I saw.
 Ah dear son Edgar,
     The food of thy abused father's wrath!
     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
     I'ld say I had eyes again!
  Old Man.
 Is it a beggarman?
  Old Man.
 He has some reason, else he could not beg.
 I have heard more since.
- Bless thee, master!
  Glou.
 Then prithee get thee gone.
                                  Exit.
 Sirrah naked fellow-
  Edg.
 [aside] And yet I must.

  Glou.
 So,
     bless thee, master!
  Glou.
 Heavens, deal so still!  
     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
     Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;
     So distribution should undo excess,
     And each man have enough.
 Give me thy arm.


Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.
 I marvel our mild husband
     Not met us on the way.


                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.

     I told him of the army that was landed:
     He smil'd at it.
 Ere long you are like to hear
     (If you dare venture in your own behalf)
     A mistress's command.
          [Gives a favour.
 This kiss, if it durst speak,
     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.

     Conceive, and fare thee well.

  Osw.

     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
     A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
     It will come,
     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
     Like monsters of the deep.
 Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!  
     Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness
     To let these hands obey my blood,
     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
     Thy flesh and bones.
 Howe'er thou art a fiend,
     A woman's shape doth shield thee.
 This shows you are above,
     You justicers, that these our nether crimes
     So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!
     Lose he his other eye?
  Gent.
 Both, both, my lord.

  Gon.

Exit.
 Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
  Gent.

                                                         Exeunt.





Scene III.
 The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.

  Kent.
 In brief,
     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
     If all could so become it.
 Made she no verbal question?
  Gent.
 No.
 Alack, poor gentleman!
  Kent.

     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
     Lending me this acquaintance.

The French camp.

     Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
     The which he lacks.

  Cor.
 'Tis known before.
 Our preparation stands
     In expectation of them.
 O dear father,
     It is thy business that I go about.

     No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
     But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.


  Reg.
 Ay, madam.

     Your sister is the better soldier.
 I know not, lady.

     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
     To let him live.
 Edmund, I think, is gone,
     In pity of his misery, to dispatch
     His nighted life; moreover, to descry
     The strength o' th' enemy.
 I may not, madam.
 Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-
     Let me unseal the letter.
 You may gather more.
 Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
     What party I do follow.

The country near Dover.
 Look how we labour.
 Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
     By your eyes' anguish.
 Methinks y'are better spoken.
 The murmuring surge
     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes
     Cannot be heard so high.
 Set me where you stand.
 You are now within a foot
     Of th' extreme verge.
 For all beneath the moon
     Would I not leap upright.

  Glou.
  
  Edg.

  Glou.

  Edg.
 Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
     So many fadom down precipitating,
     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;
     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.

     It was some fiend.
 Therefore, thou happy father,
     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.
 Henceforth I'll bear
     Affliction till it do cry out itself
     'Enough, enough,' and die.
 That thing you speak of,
     I took it for a man.
 Often 'twould say
     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
 O thou side-piercing sight!
  Lear.
 Nature 's above art in that respect.
 There's your press
     money.
 Draw me
     a clothier's yard.
 There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
     on a giant.
 Bring up the brown bills.
 O, well flown, bird! i'
     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.

  Lear.

  Glou.

  Lear.
 When the rain came to wet me
     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would  
     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em
     out.
 Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was
     everything.
 Ay, every inch a king!
     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
 Die for adultery? No.

     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
  
     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
     With a more riotous appetite.

  Glou.
 O, let me kiss that hand!
  Lear.
 Dost thou know me?
  Lear.
 Dost thou squiny at me?
     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love.

  Glou.
  
  Lear.
 Read.

  Glou.

  Lear.
 Hark in thine ear.

     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all.
 Now, now, now, now!
     Pull off my boots.
 Alack, alack the day!
  Lear.
 When we are born, we cry that we are come
     To this great stage of fools.
 This' a good block.
 No seconds? All myself?
     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,
     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

  Gent.
 Then there's life in't.
 Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
     by running.
 I thank you sir.
 That's all.

  Gent.

  Glou.
 Well pray you, father.

  Glou.
 A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
     Am pregnant to good pity.
 The sword is out
     That must destroy thee.
 An chud
     ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as
     'tis by a vortnight.
 Out, dunghill!
                                                     They fight.
 Come! No matter vor your foins.

  Edg.
 Sit you down, father; rest you.
 I am only sorry
     He had no other deathsman.
 Let us see.
 If your will want not, time and
     place will be fruitfully offer'd.
 There is nothing done, if he  
     return the conqueror.
 The King is mad.


  Cor.
 Madam, sleeps still.
 So please your Majesty
     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
 Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
     I' th' sway of your own will.
 Is he array'd?

              Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.
 Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
 Kind and dear princess!
  Cor.

  Cor.
 How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
  Lear.
  
  Cor.
 Still, still, far wide!
  Doct.

     I am a very foolish fond old man,
     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
     And, to deal plainly,
     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
 And so I am! I am!
  Lear.

  Doct.
 Be comforted, good madam.
  
  Cor.
 They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of Kent
     in Germany.
 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
     the kingdom approach apace.
 My point and period will be throughly wrought,
     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

The British camp near Dover.


  Edm.
 Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
     Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
     To change the course.
 Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

  Reg.

  Reg.
 Fear me not.
 [aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
     Should loosen him and me.
  
  Reg.
 I shall attend you presently at your tent.

  Reg.
 Sister, you'll go with us?
  Gon.
 If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
     Hear me one word.

                              Exeunt [all but Albany and Edgar].
 Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
 I was forbid it.

     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
     And I'll appear again.
 I will o'erlook thy paper.
 To both these sisters have I sworn my love;  
     Each jealous of the other, as the stung
     Are of the adder.
 Which of them shall I take?
     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
     If both remain alive.
 To take the widow
     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
     And hardly shall I carry out my side,
     Her husband being alive.





Scene II.


Enter Edgar and Gloucester.
 Pray that the right may thrive.


               Alarum and retreat within.
 A man may rot even here.
 And that's true too.

  Cor.
 We are not the first
     Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.

     For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
     Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.

  Edm.

     The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,
     Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.
 Come hither, Captain; hark.

     One step I have advanc'd thee.
 If thou dost
     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
     To noble fortunes.
 I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
     If it be man's work, I'll do't.


          Flourish.
 You have the captives
     Who were the opposites of this day's strife.

  Alb.
 Sir, by your patience,
     I hold you but a subject of this war,
     Not as a brother.
 That's as we list to grace him.
  
  Gon.

  Gon.
 Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
     From a full-flowing stomach.

     Witness the world that I create thee here
     My lord and master.
 Mean you to enjoy him?
  Alb.
 Half-blooded fellow, yes.
 [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

  Gon.
 An interlude!
  Alb.
 Let the trumpet sound.

  Reg.
 [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

  Edm.
 He that dares approach,
     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
     My truth and honour firmly.
 A herald, ho!
  Edm.
 My sickness grows upon me.

                           Enter a Herald.

  Her.
 Again!                                     Third trumpet.
 What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
  Edm.

     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
     My oath, and my profession.
 In wisdom I should ask thy name;
     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
     What safe and nicely I might well delay
     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
]
  Alb.

     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.
 Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.

     Who can arraign me for't?
  Alb.
 Most monstrous!
     Know'st thou this paper?
  Gon.
 Ask me not what I know.

  Alb.

     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.

     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
 This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
     You look as you had something more to say.

  Alb.


  Gent.

     It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!
  Alb.
 Who dead? Speak, man.
 All three
     Now marry in an instant.
]
     This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble
     Touches us not with pity.
 I am come
     To bid my king and master aye good night.
 Great thing of us forgot!
     Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?
                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.
 Run, run, O, run!
  Edg.

  Edm.
  
  Alb.
 The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

                                          [Edmund is borne off.

     She's dead as earth.

     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
     Why, then she lives.

  Lear.
 Ha!
     What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,
     Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.

  Capt.

  Lear.
 The same-
     Your servant Kent.
 Where is your servant Caius?
  Lear.
 He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.

  Lear.
 Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
 He knows not what he says; and vain is it
     That we present us to him.

  Edg.


                           Enter a Captain.
 For us, we will resign,
     During the life of this old Majesty,
     To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your
        rights;
     With boot, and Such addition as your honours
     Have more than merited.
  
  Edg.
 Our present business
     Is general woe.

     My master calls me; I must not say no.

  Alb.
 My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
 I can but say their protestation over;
    So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
    That is, to live and study here three years.

    But there are other strict observances,
    As: not to see a woman in that term,  
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
    And one day in a week to touch no food,
    And but one meal on every day beside,
    The which I hope is not enrolled there;
    And then to sleep but three hours in the night
    And not be seen to wink of all the day-
    When I was wont to think no harm all night,
    And make a dark night too of half the day-
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
 Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
 You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.

    What is the end of study, let me know.

  KING.
 Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?  
  KING.

    If study's gain be thus, and this be so,
    Study knows that which yet it doth not know.

  BEROWNE.
 Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
    Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,
    As painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.

    Study me how to please the eye indeed,
    By fixing it upon a fairer eye;
    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
    And give him light that it was blinded by.

  BEROWNE.
 In reason nothing.

  BEROWNE.

  KING.

  KING.
 [Reads] 'Item.
 That no woman shall come within a mile of
    my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?
  LONGAVILLE.
 Four days ago.
 Let's see the penalty.
 [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
    tongue.
' Who devis'd this penalty?
  LONGAVILLE.
 If any man be seen to talk with a woman within
    the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the
    rest of the court can possibly devise.
 So study evermore is over-shot.

  KING.

    So to the laws at large I write my name;        [Subscribes]
    And he that breaks them in the least degree
    Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
  
    Suggestions are to other as to me;
    But I believe, although I seem so loath,
    I am the last that will last keep his oath.
 Ay, that there is.
 Signior Arme- Arme- commends you.
 Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
 Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
    in the merriness.

    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

  BEROWNE.

  BEROWNE.

  BEROWNE.

  COSTARD.

  KING.
 So much for the time When.
 Then
    for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene
    and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen
    the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest,
    surveyest, or seest.
 There did I see that low-spirited swain,  
    that base minnow of thy mirth,'

 Ay, the best for the worst.

 Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week
    with bran and water.
 Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
    melancholy?
  MOTH.
 Why tough signior? Why tough signior?

 Pretty and apt.

    my saying pretty?  
  ARMADO.
 Wherefore apt?

  MOTH.
 That an eel is quick.

  ARMADO.
 I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.

 A most fine figure!

 And as it is base for
    a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench.
 I
    think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid.
 Comfort
    me, boy; what great men have been in love?
  MOTH.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  
  MOTH.

  ARMADO.
 Define, define, well-educated infant.

             Then if she fear, or be to blame,
               By this you shall not know;
             For still her cheeks possess the same
               Which native she doth owe.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.

  JAQUENETTA.
 Lord, how wise you are!  
  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 And so, farewell.
 Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
    pardoned.

  COSTARD.
 Thou shalt be heavily punished.

  COSTARD.
 Take away this villain; shut him up.
 Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.

    I shall be forsworn- which is a great argument of falsehood- if I
    love.
 There is no evil angel but
    Love.
 The first and second cause
    will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello
    he regards not; his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory
    is to subdue men.
  
    Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Know you the man?
  MARIA.

    A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
    Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
    Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
  
    Who are the rest?
  KATHARINE.

    Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
    Within the limit of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal.
 Marry, thus much I have learnt:
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,
    Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
    Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
    To let you enter his unpeopled house.

                                    [The LADIES-IN-WAITING mask]
  
             Enter KING, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BEROWNE,
                         and ATTENDANTS

    Here comes Navarre.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.
 Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.

  KING.
 Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

    I hear your Grace hath sworn out house-keeping.
 YOU Will the sooner that I were away,
    For you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay.
 I know you did.

  KATHARINE.

  BEROWNE.
 Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

  BEROWNE.
 Now fair befall your mask!
  KATHARINE.
 Madam, your father here doth intimate
    The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
    Being but the one half of an entire sum
    Disbursed by my father in his wars.

    But say that he or we, as neither have,
    Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
    A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
    One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
    Although not valued to the money's worth.
 So please your Grace, the packet is not come,
    Where that and other specialties are bound;
    To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

    Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.
 Sweet health and fair desires consort your
    Grace!
  KING.
 Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.
 Pray you, do my commendations;  
    I would be glad to see it.
 Is the fool sick?
  BEROWNE.
 Alack, let it blood.
 Will YOU prick't with your eye?
  ROSALINE.
 And yours from long living!
  BEROWNE.
 Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
  BOYET.
 A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.

  LONGAVILLE.
 I desire her name.
 Pray you, sir, whose daughter?  
  BOYET.
 God's blessing on your beard!
  BOYET.
           Exit LONGAVILLE
  BEROWNE.
 What's her name in the cap?
  BOYET.
 Rosaline, by good hap.
 To her will, sir, or so.
 That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
    Not a word with him but a jest.
  
  KATHARINE.
 And wherefore not ships?
    No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
 You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?
  BOYET.
 So you grant pasture for me.
     [Offering to kiss her]
  KATHARINE.
 Belonging to whom?
  KATHARINE.
 Your reason?
  BOYET.

    His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,
    Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed;
    His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
    Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
    All senses to that sense did make their repair,
    To feel only looking on fairest of fair.

    I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
    An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
 Come, to our pavilion.

  MARIA.
 He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.
 Ay, our way to be gone.

  BOYET.
 Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

  MOTH.
 Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
  ARMADO.
 The hobby-horse is forgot.
 Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
  MOTH.
 A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
    instant.
 Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.

  MOTH.

  ARMADO.
 But I go.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 I say lead is slow.

  MOTH.

  ARMADO.

  COSTARD.

    There's the moral.

  MOTH.
 I will tell you sensibly.

  COSTARD.
 True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
    loose.
 Like the sequel, I.
 Signior Costard, adieu.

  COSTARD.
 God be wi' you!
  BEROWNE.
 Stay, slave; I must employ thee.

  BEROWNE.
 It must be done this afternoon.

    Hark, slave, it is but this:
    The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
    And in her train there is a gentle lady;
    When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
    And Rosaline they call her.
 Gardon- remuneration!                    Exit
  BEROWNE.
 O my little heart!
    And I to be a corporal of his field,
    And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!  
    What! I love, I sue, I seek a wife-
    A woman, that is like a German clock,
    Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
    And never going aright, being a watch,
    But being watch'd that it may still go right!
    Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of all;
    And, among three, to love the worst of all,
    A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
    With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
    Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed,
    Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
 I know not; but I think it was not he.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
    A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
 I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot,
    And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
 Yes, madam, fair.
 Nay, never paint me now;
    Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.

    Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
                                             [ Giving him money]
    Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

  BOYET.


                       Enter COSTARD

  BOYET.

    Break up this capon.

  BOYET.
 [Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;
    true that thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely.

    More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth
    itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal.
 He came, one; saw, two; overcame, three.
 Why did he come?- to see.
 What saw he?- the beggar.
 Who
    overcame he?- the beggar.
 The conclusion is victory; on whose
    side?- the king's.
 No, on both in one, or one in both.
 Shall I command thy love? I may.

    Who gave thee this letter?
  COSTARD.
 From which lord to which lady?
  COSTARD.
 Thou hast mistaken his letter.
 Who is the shooter? who is the shooter?
  ROSALINE.
 Ay, my continent of beauty.
 Well then, I am the shooter.

    Finely put on indeed!
  MARIA.
 But she herself is hit lower.
 Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man
    when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as touching the hit  
    it?
  BOYET.

  BOYET.
  
  COSTARD.

                                          Exeunt BOYET and MARIA
  COSTARD.
 Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of
    a good conscience.
 Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

  DULL.

  DULL.
 And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
    never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket
    that the Princess kill'd.

  HOLOFERNES.

    Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

  NATHANIEL.
 Mehercle, if their sons be ingenious, they shall want
    no instruction; if their daughters be capable, I will put it to
    them; but, vir sapit qui pauca loquitur.
 God give you good morrow, Master Person.

  HOLOFERNES.
 Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;
    it was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado.
 I
    beseech you read it.
 Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.

    Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
    Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
 Ovidius Naso was the man.
' I will look again on
    the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party  
    writing to the person written unto: 'Your Ladyship's in all
    desired employment, Berowne.
' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one
    of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter
    to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by
    the way of progression, hath miscarried.

  HOLOFERNES.
 And certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
 Ay me!
  BEROWNE.
 Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
  LONGAVILLE.
 Ay me, I am forsworn!
  BEROWNE.
 In love, I hope; sweet fellowship in shame!
  BEROWNE.

  LONGAVILLE.
 Am I the first that have been perjur'd so?
  BEROWNE.
 I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
  
    O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
    These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
 This same shall go.

    Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,
    And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye.

  BEROWNE.
 Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
 Amen, so I had mine! Is not that a good word?
  DUMAIN.

  BEROWNE.
 A fever in your blood? Why, then incision
    Would let her out in saucers.
 Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

        "Air," quoth he "thy cheeks may blow;
        Air, would I might triumph so!
        But, alack, my hand is sworn
        Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
        Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
        Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
"'
    This will I send; and something else more plain
    That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
 [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his, your case is such.

    I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
    And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.

    When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
    Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute's time
    In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
    Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
    A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
    A leg, a limb-
  KING.
 I post from love; good lover, let me go.

  KING.
 Where hadst thou it?  
  COSTARD.

                                      [BEROWNE tears the letter]
  KING.

  LONGAVILLE.

    O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
 True, true, we are four.

    Will these turtles be gone?
  KING.
 Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
 Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
    As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
 What zeal, what fury hath inspir'd thee now?
    My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
    She, an attending star, scarce seen a light.
 My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.

    Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
    And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy.
 Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
    A wife of such wood were felicity.

  KING.
 To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
 I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
 No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

  DUMAIN.
 Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

  LONGAVILLE.
 'Tis more than need.

    And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,
    In that each of you have forsworn his book,
    Can you still dream, and pore, and thereon look?
    For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
    Have found the ground of study's excellence
    Without the beauty of a woman's face?
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
    They are the ground, the books, the academes,
    From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.

    Now, for not looking on a woman's face,  
    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
    And study too, the causer of your vow;
    For where is author in the world
    Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
    Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
    And where we are our learning likewise is;
    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
    With ourselves.

    Do we not likewise see our learning there?
    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.

    Then fools you were these women to forswear;
    Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.

    Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
  KING.

 Hold, there is the very remuneration I had
    of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of
    discretion.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
 Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to
    congratulate the Princess at her pavilion, in the posteriors of
    this day; which the rude multitude call the afternoon.
 The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable,
    congruent, and measurable, for the afternoon.
 I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy.

  HOLOFERNES.
 Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.

    Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
    show in the posterior of this day, to be rend'red by our
    assistance, the King's command, and this most gallant,
    illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess- I say
    none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.

  HOLOFERNES.
 I'll make one in a dance, or so, or I will play
    On the tabor to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  ROSALINE.
 Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.


                          Enter BOYET

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.

    Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
    Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
 Under the cool shade of a sycamore  
    I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
    When, lo, to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
    Toward that shade I might behold addrest
    The King and his companions; warily
    I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
    And overheard what you shall overhear-
    That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.

    One rubb'd his elbow, thus, and fleer'd, and swore  
    A better speech was never spoke before.

    Another with his finger and his thumb
    Cried 'Via! we will do't, come what will come.
'
    The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
    For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
    And not a man of them shall have the grace,
    Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
 Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.

  KATHARINE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
  BOYET.

  MOTH.
 A holy parcel of the fairest dames
                            [The LADIES turn their backs to him]
    That ever turn'd their- backs- to mortal views!
  BEROWNE.
 Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
 She hears herself.

    Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
    That we, like savages, may worship it.
 Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.

    Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
    Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

  ROSALINE.
 O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
    Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.

    Thou bid'st me beg; this begging is not strange.
 Play, music, then.
 But your legs should do it.
 We can afford no more at such a price.
 Your absence only.
 Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
    Twice to your visor and half once to you.
 If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

  ROSALINE.

  KING.
 I am best pleas'd with that.
 White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Let it not be sweet.

  BEROWNE.

  DUMAIN.

  KATHARINE.
 O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
 You have a double tongue within your mask,
    And would afford my speechless vizard half.
 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman.
 Is not 'veal' a calf?  
  LONGAVILLE.

    Take all and wean it; it may prove an ox.

  KATHARINE.

  BOYET.

  BEROWNE.
 Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

    Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?
  BOYET.
 And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
 And Longaville was for my service born.
 Gone to her tent.
 Please it your Majesty
    Command me any service to her thither?
  KING.

    'A can carve too, and lisp; why this is he
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
    This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,
    That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
    In honourable terms; nay, he can sing
    A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
    Mend him who can.
 A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,  
    That put Armado's page out of his part!

        Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE,
                      MARIA, and KATHARINE

  BEROWNE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

    The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
  
    Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
    As the unsullied lily, I protest,
    A world of torments though I should endure,
    I would not yield to be your house's guest;
    So much I hate a breaking cause to be
    Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.

  KING.

  ROSALINE.

    I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
    When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
 But that you take what doth to you belong,
    It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
 Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
  BEROWNE.
  
  KING.

    Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
    Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,
    Figures pedantical- these summer-flies  
    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.

    And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-
    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

  BEROWNE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
    As precious eyesight, and did value me
    Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,
    That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
 My faith and this the Princess I did give;
    I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

    You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye
    Wounds like a leaden sword.
 What, are there but three?
  COSTARD.

  COSTARD.
 O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
    show whereuntil it doth amount.

  BEROWNE.
 We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.


                        Enter ARMADO

  ARMADO.
 That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I
    protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too too vain,
    too too vain; but we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la
    guerra.
 I Pompey am-
  BEROWNE.

  BEROWNE.
 It is Great, sir.


    If your ladyship would say 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander.

  BEROWNE.
 A conqueror
    and afeard to speak! Run away for shame, Alisander.
 He is a
    marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good bowler; but for
    Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Stand aside, good Pompey.

    Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
    Ergo I come with this apology.
      [MOTH retires]
    Judas I am-
  DUMAIN.
 How art thou prov'd Judas?
  HOLOFERNES.
 The more shame for you, Judas!
  HOLOFERNES.
 To make Judas hang himself.
 Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

  HOLOFERNES.

  BEROWNE.
 A cittern-head.
 Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
 But you have outfac'd them all.

  BOYET.
 I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.

  LONGAVILLE.

  DUMAIN.
 More calf, certain.

  LONGAVILLE.

  ARMADO.
 I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
    Hector.
 But  
    I will forward with my device.
 [To the PRINCESS] Sweet royalty,
    bestow on me the sense of hearing.
 I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper.
 What meanest thou?
  COSTARD.
 She's quick; the child brags in her belly already;
    'tis yours.
 Hector trembles.
 More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir
    them on!
  DUMAIN.
 Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will
    sup a flea.

  ARMADO.

  COSTARD.
 I will not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'll
    slash; I'll do it by the sword.
 I bepray you, let me borrow my
    arms again.

  ARMADO.
 True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
    since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of
    Jaquenetta's, and that 'a wears next his heart for a favour.


                 Enter as messenger, MONSIEUR MARCADE

  MARCADE.
 WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud.
 For mine own part, I breathe free breath.
 Boyet, prepare; I will away to-night.
 I thank you, gracious lords,
    For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,
    Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
    In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    The liberal opposition of our spirits,
    If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
    In the converse of breath- your gentleness
    Was guilty of it.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
    Neither intitled in the other's heart.

  BEROWNE.
 And what to me, my love? and what to me?
  ROSALINE.
 But what to me, my love? but what to me?
    A wife?
  KATHARINE.
 No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
    I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.

    Come when the King doth to my lady come;
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
 Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
 I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

  MARIA.
 The liker you; few taller are so young.

  BEROWNE.

  ROSALINE.

  BEROWNE.
 Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,  
    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
    Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.

    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
    And I shall find you empty of that fault,
    Right joyful of your reformation.

  BEROWNE.
 No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

  BEROWNE.
 Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
    Jack hath not Jill.
 Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day,  
    And then 'twill end.

SCENE: Scotland and England


ACT I.

A desert place.
 Thunder and lightning.


  FIRST WITCH.
 When shall we three meet again?
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
  SECOND WITCH.
 Paddock calls.

A camp near Forres.
 Alarum within.


  DUNCAN.

  DUNCAN.
 Mark, King of Scotland, mark.
 Yes,
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.

  DUNCAN.
 That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
    Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

  ROSS.


Enter the three Witches.


  FIRST WITCH.
 Where hast thou been, sister?
  SECOND WITCH.
 "Give me," quoth I.

  FIRST WITCH.
 How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
    That man may question? You seem to understand me,
    By each at once her choppy finger laying
    Upon her skinny lips.

    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Your favors nor your hate.

  FIRST WITCH.

  THIRD WITCH.
 Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
  MACBETH.
 Whither are they vanish'd?
  MACBETH.
 Would they had stay'd!
  BANQUO.
 You shall be King.
 To the selfsame tune and words.
 As thick as hail
    Came post with post, and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
    And pour'd them down before him.

  ANGUS.
 We are sent
    To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.

  ROSS.
 What, can the devil speak true?
  MACBETH.
 [Aside to Macbeth.
 [Aside.
] Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.
 If ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of success,
    Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.

  BANQUO.
 Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
    With things forgotten.
 Till then, enough.
 The palace.


Flourish.


  DUNCAN.
 But I have spoke
    With one that saw him die, who did report
    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
    Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
    A deep repentance.
 There's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face:
    He was a gentleman on whom I built
    An absolute trust.


    O worthiest cousin!
    The sin of my ingratitude even now
    Was heavy on me.
 Thou art so far before,
    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
    To overtake thee.

  MACBETH.

    I have begun to plant thee, and will labor
    To make thee full of growing.
 There if I grow,
    The harvest is your own.

    I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
    The hearing of my wife with your approach;
    So humbly take my leave.
  
  DUNCAN.
          Exit.

Inverness.


  LADY MACBETH.
 When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
 Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone.


                     Enter a Messenger.


    What is your tidings?
  MESSENGER.

    One of my fellows had the speed of him,
    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
    Than would make up his message.
 Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell  
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"

                    Enter Macbeth.
 Tomorrow, as he purposes.

  LADY MACBETH.
 To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,  
    Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under it.

Before Macbeth's castle.


Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus,
and Attendants.

  LADY MACBETH.
  
  DUNCAN.
  Hautboys and torches.
 But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor.
 He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,  
    Not bear the knife myself.


                 Enter Lady Macbeth.
 Prithee, peace!
    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.
 If we should fail?
  LADY MACBETH.
 SCENE I.
 The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

  BANQUO.

  FLEANCE.

  BANQUO.
 There's husbandry in heaven,
    Their candles are all out.

    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
    And yet I would not sleep.
 Merciful powers,
    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
    Gives way to in repose!

           Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
 What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.
  
    He hath been in unusual pleasure and
    Sent forth great largess to your offices.

  MACBETH.
 I think not of them;
    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
    We would spend it in some words upon that business,
    If you would grant the time.
 and Fleance.

  MACBETH.

    Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
    Or else worth all the rest.


  LADY MACBETH.
 I have drugg'd their possets
    That death and nature do contend about them,
    Whether they live or die.
] Who's there' what, ho!
  LADY MACBETH.
 Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
    And 'tis not done.
 I have done the deed.
 I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.

    Did not you speak?
  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.
 This is a sorry sight.

  LADY MACBETH.

    Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"
    When they did say, "God bless us!"
  LADY MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.

  MACBETH.
 I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast-
  LADY MACBETH.
 Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house;
    "Glamis hath murther'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
    Shall sleep no more.
"
  LADY MACBETH.

    Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
    They must lie there.

  LADY MACBETH.
 [Knocking within.

    Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us
    And show us to be watchers.

                                                Knocking within.


Enter a Porter.
] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven.
 O,
    come in, equivocator.
 [Knocking within.
 I had thought to have let in some of
    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting
    bonfire.
 [Knocking within.

  MACDUFF.
 Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
  MACBETH.
                           Exit.

  LENNOX.
 Where we lay,
    Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,
    Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,
    And prophesying with accents terrible
    Of dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woeful time.

    Awake, awake!
    Ring the alarum bell.
       Bell rings.


    O Banquo, Banquo!
    Our royal master's murther'd.

  LADY MACBETH.


          Re-enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.


                Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.
 What is amiss?
  MACBETH.
 Your royal father's murther'd.
 Who could refrain,
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Courage to make 's love known?
  LADY MACBETH.
 [Aside to Donalbain.
 [Aside to Malcolm.

    And when we have our naked frailties hid,
    That suffer in exposure, let us meet
    And question this most bloody piece of work
    To know it further.

  MACDUFF.
 And so do I.

  ALL.
 What will you do? Let's not consort with them.

  DONALBAIN.
 To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
    Shall keep us both the safer.

                                                         Exeunt.

  ROSS.

  ROSS.
 'Tis said they eat each other.
 They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
    That look'd upon't.
 He is already named, and gone to Scone
    To be invested.

  ROSS.
 Carried to Colmekill,
    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
    And guardian of their bones.

  ROSS.
 No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

  OLD MAN.
>>



ACT III.
 Let your Highness
    Command upon me, to the which my duties
    Are with a most indissoluble tie
    Forever knit.
 As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
    'Twixt this and supper.

  MACBETH.
 Our time does call upon 's.

  MACBETH.

    Farewell.
 There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar.
 It was, so please your Highness.

  MACBETH.
"
  FIRST MURTHERER.
  
    Now if you have a station in the file,
    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it,
    And I will put that business in your bosoms
    Whose execution takes your enemy off,
    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
    Which in his death were perfect.

  SECOND MURTHERER.
 I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.
 So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
    That every minute of his being thrusts  
    Against my near'st of life; and though I could
    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
    For certain friends that are both his and mine,
    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
    Who I myself struck down.
 We shall, my lord,
    Perform what you command us.
 Within this hour at most
    I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
    The moment on't; fort must be done tonight
    And something from the palace (always thought
    That I require a clearness); and with him-
    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-
    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,  
    Whose absence is no less material to me
    Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
    Of that dark hour.

  MACBETH.


Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.


  LADY MACBETH.
 Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.

  SERVANT.
 Madam, I will.
  
  MACBETH.
 Better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy.
 O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
    Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.

  MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.





SCENE III.
 Macbeth.
 Then stand with us.
 His horses go about.

  FIRST MURTHERER.
 O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
    Thou mayst revenge.
 O slave!          Dies.
 We have lost
    Best half of our affair.

    Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
    We will require her welcome.
 'Tis better thee without than he within.

    Is he dispatch'd?
  MURTHERER.
 My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

  MACBETH.
] Then comes my fit again.

  MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.
 To feed were best at home;
    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
    Meeting were bare without it.
 His absence, sir,
    Lays blame upon his promise.

    Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man?
  MACBETH.
 O, these flaws and starts,
    Impostors to true fear, would well become
    A woman's story at a winter's fire,
    Authorized by her grandam.

  MACBETH.

    If charnel houses and our graves must send
    Those that we bury back, our monuments
    Shall be the maws of kites.
 This is more strange
    Than such a murther is.

    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    To those that know me.

    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.

  LORDS.
 Our duties and the pledge.


  MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.
 What man dare, I dare.
 Or be alive again,
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
 Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder? You make me strange
    Even to the disposition that I owe
    When now I think you can behold such sights
    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
    When mine is blanch'd with fear.
 What sights, my lord?
  LADY MACBETH.
 I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
    Question enrages him.

    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.

  MACBETH.

    Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;  
    Augures and understood relations have
    By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
    The secret'st man of blood.
 Did you send to him, sir?
  MACBETH.
 I hear it by the way, but I will send.
 I will tomorrow,
    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
 For mine own good
    All causes shall give way.
 My strange and self-abuse  
    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.


Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.


  FIRST WITCH.

  HECATE.

    But make amends now.
 Get you gone,
    And at the pit of Acheron
    Meet me i' the morning.

                                        Music and a song within,
                                         "Come away, come away.
  
  FIRST WITCH.
 The palace.

    Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
    To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!
    How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight,
    In pious rage, the two delinquents tear
    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,
    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
    To hear the men deny't.
 Thither Macduff
    Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid
    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;
    That by the help of these, with Him above
    To ratify the work, we may again
    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
    Do faithful homage, and receive free honors-  
    All which we pine for now.


Enter the three Witches.

  SECOND WITCH.
 Round about the cauldron go;
    In the poison'd entrails throw.

  SECOND WITCH.

  ALL.
  

            Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.
 I conjure you, by that which you profess
    (Howeer you come to know it) answer me:
    Though you untie the winds and let them fight
    Against the churches, though the yesty waves
    Confound and swallow navigation up,
    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,
    Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
    Though palaces and pyramids do slope
    Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure
    Of nature's germaines tumble all together
    Even till destruction sicken, answer me
    To what I ask you.
 Speak.

  THIRD WITCH.
 Tell me, thou unknown power-
  FIRST WITCH.

  FIRST APPARITION.
 Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,
    Beware the Thane of Fife.
 Dismiss me.

                                                       Descends.

  MACBETH.
 Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
  MACBETH.
 Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn
    The power of man, for none of woman born
    Shall harm Macbeth.
                                Descends.

  MACBETH.


    What is this,
    That rises like the issue of a king,
    And wears upon his baby brow the round
    And top of sovereignty?
  ALL.

    Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?
                                                       Hautboys.
 Show!
  THIRD.

    A third is like the former.

    Horrible sight! Now I see 'tis true;
    For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,  
    And points at them for his.
 But why
    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
    Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
    And show the best of our delights.
 No indeed, my lord.

  MACBETH.
 Infected be the 'air whereon they ride,
    And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
    The galloping of horse.

  MACBETH.
 Fled to England?
  LENNOX.
 From this moment
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
    The firstlings of my hand.
 Macduff's castle.


Enter Lady Macduff, her Son, and Ross.

  ROSS.

    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So runs against all reason.
 I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
 Sirrah, your father's dead.

    And what will you do now? How will you live?
  SON.

  LADY MACDUFF.
 Why should I, Mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
 Yes, he is dead.

  SON.
 Why one that swears and lies.
 And be all traitors that do so?
  LADY MACDUFF.
 Who must hang them?
  LADY MACDUFF.

  LADY MACDUFF.
 But I remember now
    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
    Is often laudable, to do good sometime
    Accounted dangerous folly.


  FIRST MURTHERER.
 He's a traitor.

  SON.
 What, you egg!
                                                      Stabs him.

    Young fry of treachery!
  SON.

  MALCOLM.
 You may be rightly just,
    Whatever I shall think.
 Bleed, bleed, poor country!
    Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,  
    For goodness dare not check thee.

  MALCOLM.
 It is myself I mean, in whom I know  
    All the particulars of vice so grafted
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
    With my confineless harms.
 I grant him bloody,
    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
    That has a name.
 Boundless intemperance
    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been  
    The untimely emptying of the happy throne,
    And fall of many kings.
 This avarice
    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root  
    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
    The sword of our slain kings.
 O Scotland, Scotland!
  MALCOLM.
 Fare thee well!
    These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
    Have banish'd me from Scotland.
 I am yet
    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
    At no time broke my faith, would not betray
    The devil to his fellow, and delight
    No less in truth than life.
 My first false speaking
    Was this upon myself.
 Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
    'Tis hard to reconcile.


                     Enter a Doctor.
 'Tis call'd the evil:
    A most miraculous work in this good King,
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do.

  MACDUFF.

  MACDUFF.
 Why, well.
 No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

  MACDUFF.
 Be not a niggard of your speech.
 How goest?
  ROSS.
 When I came hither to transport the tidings,
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
    Of many worthy fellows that were out,
    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
    For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
 If it be mine,
    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

  MACDUFF.
 Be comforted.
  
  MACDUFF.
 All my pretty ones?
    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?
  MALCOLM.

  MACDUFF.
 Did heaven look on,
    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
    They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
    Fell slaughter on their souls.
 Be this the whetstone of your sword.
 This tune goes manly.

 SCENE I.

Dunsinane.
 You see, her eyes are open.
 I have known her continue in this a quarter of
    an hour.
 The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What,
    will these hands neer be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more
    o' that.
 All the perfumes
    of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
 Oh, oh, oh!
  DOCTOR.
 What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

  GENTLEWOMAN.
 Well, well, well-
  GENTLEWOMAN.
 Pray God it be, sir.

  DOCTOR.
 I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out
    on's grave.

    To bed, to bed, to bed.

  DOCTOR.
 Will she go now to bed?
  GENTLEWOMAN.
 So good night.
 Good night, good doctor.





SCENE II.

  CAITHNESS.

  MENTEITH.
 What does the tyrant?
  CAITHNESS.
 Who then shall blame
    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
    When all that is within him does condemn
    Itself for being there?
  CAITHNESS.

    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
    And with him pour we, in our country's purge,
    Each drop of us.
           Exeunt marching.





SCENE III.
 A room in the castle.
 What's the boy Malcolm?
    Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
    "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
    Shall e'er have power upon thee.

  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.
 'Tis not needed yet.

    Send out more horses, skirr the country round,
    Hang those that talk of fear.
 Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.
 Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.

    Come, sir, dispatch.
 Bring it after me.
             Exeunt.

Country near Birnam Wood.


Enter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness,
Angus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.


  MALCOLM.

  MENTEITH.
 What wood is this before us?
  MENTEITH.
 The Wood of Birnam.

  MALCOLM.
 'Tis his main hope;
    For where there is advantage to be given,
    Both more and less have given him the revolt,  
    And none serve with him but constrained things
    Whose hearts are absent too.

    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.





SCENE V.
 Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still, "They come!" Our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn.
 Here let them lie
    Till famine and the ague eat them up.
            Exit.

  MACBETH.

     Wherefore was that cry?
  SEYTON.
 The Queen, my lord, is dead.
 It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.


    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

                                                         Exeunt.

  YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
 Thou wast born of woman.


                Alarums.
 There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems bruited.


                Enter Malcolm and old Siward.
 This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.

  MALCOLM.
 Enter, sir, the castle.

                                                 Exeunt.





SCENE VIII.

Another part of the field.
 Thou losest labor.

    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.

    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;  
    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
    To one of woman born.

  MACDUFF.
"
  MACBETH.

    And so his knell is knoll'd.

SCENE:
Vienna


ACT I.
 Escalus!
  ESCALUS.

  DUKE.
 Thyself and thy belongings
    Are not thine own so proper as to waste
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
 But I do bend my speech
    To one that can my part in him advertise.
 Now, good my lord,
    Let there be some more test made of my metal,
    Before so noble and so great a figure
    Be stamp'd upon it.
 No more evasion!  
    We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.

    Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
    That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
    Matters of needful value.

  DUKE.

  ANGELO.
 Let us withdraw together,
    And we may soon our satisfaction have
    Touching that point.
 I'll wait upon your honour.
 'Thou shalt not steal'?
  LUCIO.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 I never heard any soldier dislike it.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
    for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
    grace.
 Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
 I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
 I had as lief be a list of
    an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
    velvet.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
    free.
 Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
    purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-
  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 Judge.

  LUCIO.
 Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
    art full of error; I am sound.

  LUCIO.
 Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
    to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
 OVERDONE.
 OVERDONE.
 Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
    carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
    head to be chopp'd off.
 OVERDONE.
 Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
    speech we had to such a purpose.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  LUCIO.


                               Enter POMPEY  

    How now! what's the news with you?
  POMPEY.
 OVERDONE.
 OVERDONE.
 What proclamation, man?
  POMPEY.
 OVERDONE.
 To the ground, mistress.

  MRS.
 OVERDONE.
 Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
    and there's Madam Juliet.
 From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
    As surfeit is the father of much fast,
    So every scope by the immoderate use
    Turns to restraint.

  LUCIO.
 Lechery?
  CLAUDIO.

  PROVOST.
 Lucio, a word with you.
 A hundred, if they'll do you any good.

  LUCIO.
 Unhappily, even so.

    And the new deputy now for the Duke-
    Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
    Or whether that the body public be
    A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
    Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
    He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
    Whether the tyranny be in his place,  
    Or in his eminence that fills it up,
    I stagger in.
 But this new governor
    Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
    Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall
    So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
    And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
    Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
    Freshly on me.
 'Tis surely for a name.
 Come, officer, away.

A monastery

Enter DUKE and FRIAR THOMAS

  DUKE.
 Why I desire thee
    To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
    More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
    Of burning youth.
 Now, pious sir,  
    You will demand of me why I do this.
 We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
    The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,
    Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
    Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
    That goes not out to prey.
 It rested in your Grace
    To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
    And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
    Than in Lord Angelo.
 Therefore, indeed, my father,
    I have on Angelo impos'd the office;
    Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
    And yet my nature never in the fight
    To do in slander.
 And to behold his sway,
    I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
    Visit both prince and people.
 Therefore, I prithee,
    Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
    How I may formally in person bear me
    Like a true friar.
 Are not these large enough?
  ISABELLA.

  LUCIO.
        Exit FRANCISCA
  ISABELLA.
 Can you so stead me
    As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
    A novice of this place, and the fair sister
    To her unhappy brother Claudio?
  ISABELLA.
 Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
    The rather, for I now must make you know
    I am that Isabella, and his sister.

  ISABELLA.
 You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
 O, let him marry her!
  LUCIO.
 Go to Lord Angelo,
    And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
    Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
    All their petitions are as freely theirs
    As they themselves would owe them.

  LUCIO.
 I will about it straight;
    No longer staying but to give the Mother  
    Notice of my affair.

  ISABELLA.

    Let but your honour know,
    Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
    That, in the working of your own affections,
    Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,
    Or that the resolute acting of our blood
    Could have attain'd th' effect of your own purpose
    Whether you had not sometime in your life
    Err'd in this point which now you censure him,  
    And pull'd the law upon you.
 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
    Another thing to fall.
 Sir, he must die.
 Where is the Provost?
  PROVOST.
 Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
    malefactors?
  ELBOW.
 He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
 My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-
  ESCALUS.
 Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-
  ESCALUS.
 Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
    prove it.
 As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as
    I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I
    said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,  
    Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I
    said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you
    know, Master Froth, I could not give you three pence again-
  FROTH.
 All this is true.

  POMPEY.

  ANGELO.
 Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
  POMPEY.
 I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.

  ESCALUS.
 First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
    this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected
    woman.
 Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
    yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or
    child.
 Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
 Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
    true?
  ELBOW.

  ESCALUS.

  ESCALUS.

  ESCALUS.
 For mine own part, I never come into
    any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.

  ESCALUS.
 Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so  
    that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great.

  ESCALUS.
 But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
    allowed in Vienna.

  POMPEY.

  ESCALUS.
 There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
    is but heading and hanging.

  POMPEY.

    So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
 Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
    Constable.
 Seven year and a half, sir.

  ESCALUS.
 Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
    most sufficient of your parish.

  JUSTICE.
 I humbly thank you.
 It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
    But there's no remedy.
 Lord Angelo is severe.
 I crave your honour's pardon.
 Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
    Desires access to you.

  ANGELO.
 Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
    And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
    If not already.
 [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
 O just but severe law!
    I had a brother, then.

  ANGELO.
  
  ISABELLA.
 [To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
 Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
    May call it back again.

    If he had been as you, and you as he,
    You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
    Would not have been so stern.

  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.
 Alas! Alas!
    Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
    And He that might the vantage best have took
    Found out the remedy.
 To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
 Even for our kitchens
    We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
    With less respect than we do minister
    To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.

  LUCIO.
 Now 'tis awake,
    Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
    Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-
    Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd,
    And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
    Are now to have no successive degrees,
    But here they live to end.

  ISABELLA.
 I show it most of all when I show justice;
    For then I pity those I do not know,
    Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
    And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
    Lives not to act another.

  LUCIO.

  ISABELLA.
 We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
 [To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
 [To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
 Why do you put these sayings upon me?
  ISABELLA.
 Because authority, though it err like others,
    Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
    That skins the vice o' th' top.
  
  ISABELLA.

  ANGELO.
 Come again to-morrow.
 Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
 Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
 [To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
 What, do I love her,  
    That I desire to hear her speak again,
    And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
    O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
    With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
    Is that temptation that doth goad us on
    To sin in loving virtue.

  PROVOST.
 Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  JULIET.

  JULIET.
 So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
    Was mutually committed.
 Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

  JULIET.

  DUKE.
 Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
    That respites me a life whose very comfort
    Is still a dying horror!
  PROVOST.
 'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO'S house

Enter ANGELO

  ANGELO.
 Under your sentence?
  ANGELO.
 Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
    To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
    A man already made, as to remit
    Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
    In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
    Falsely to take away a life true made
    As to put metal in restrained means
    To make a false one.
  
  ISABELLA.

    Which had you rather- that the most just law
    Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
    Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
    As she that he hath stain'd?
  ISABELLA.
  
  ANGELO.

  ANGELO.
 True.
 Admit no other way to save his life,
    As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
    But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
    Finding yourself desir'd of such a person
    Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
    Could fetch your brother from the manacles
    Of the all-binding law; and that there were
    No earthly mean to save him but that either
    You must lay down the treasures of your body
    To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
    What would you do?
  ISABELLA.
 Then must your brother die.
 Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
    Are of two houses: lawful mercy
    Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.
 Be that you are,
    That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
    If you be one, as you are well express'd
    By all external warrants, show it now
    By putting on the destin'd livery.

  ISABELLA.
 Plainly conceive, I love you.

  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.
 Believe me, on mine honour,
    My words express my purpose.
        Exit
  ISABELLA.
 To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
 Be absolute for death; either death or life
    Shall thereby be the sweeter.

    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
    That none but fools would keep.
 Merely, thou art Death's fool;
    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
    And yet run'st toward him still.
 If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
    Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
    And Death unloads thee.

  CLAUDIO.
 Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
 Why,
    As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.

    Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
    Intends you for his swift ambassador,
    Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
 None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
    To cleave a heart in twain.
 But is there any?
  ISABELLA.
 Yes, brother, you may live:
    There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
    But fetter you till death.
 Perpetual durance?
  ISABELLA.
 Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
    Though all the world's vastidity you had,
    To a determin'd scope.
 Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
    So to offend him still.

  ISABELLA.
 Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
 If it were damnable, he being so wise,
    Why would he for the momentary trick
    Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel!
  ISABELLA.

  CLAUDIO.

    The weariest and most loathed worldly life
    That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
    Can lay on nature is a paradise
    To what we fear of death.
 Sweet sister, let me live.
 Nay, hear me, Isabel.

  ISABELLA.
 Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath
    made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
    disposition of natures.
 Let me ask my sister pardon.
 I am so out of love with life
    that I will sue to be rid of it.
 [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with
    you.

  DUKE.

  ISABELLA.
 I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
    name.
 Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE.

  ISABELLA.
 If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
    compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother
    saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and
    the corrupt deputy scaled.

  DUKE.
 Haste you speedily to
    Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
    promise of satisfaction.
 I thank you for this comfort.
 Fare you well, good father.
 Come your way, sir.
 Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
    to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a
    strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.
 That we were all, as some would seem to be,
    From our faults, as his faults from seeming, free.
 Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
    your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd  
    consequence; it must be so.
 You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
    will keep the house.
 No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
 Come your ways, sir; come.
 Then, Pompey, nor now.

  LUCIO.
 Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
    well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till
    eating and drinking be put down.
 They say this Angelo was not  
    made by man and woman after this downright way of creation.
 But it is certain that when he makes
    water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true.
 You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

  DUKE.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
    love.
 Come, sir, I know what I know.

  DUKE.
 Why should he die, sir?
  LUCIO.
 Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
    for untrussing.
 The
    Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays.
 OVERDONE.
 Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the
    same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.

  ESCALUS.
 Let him be call'd
    before us.
 [Exeunt
    OFFICERS with MISTRESS OVERDONE]  Provost, my brother Angelo will
    not be alter'd: Claudio must die to-morrow.

  PROVOST.

  ESCALUS.

  DUKE.
 Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
    frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good
    leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.
 Peace be with you!            Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST

         He who the sword of heaven will bear
         Should be as holy as severe;
         Pattern in himself to know,
         Grace to stand, and virtue go;  
         More nor less to others paying
         Than by self-offences weighing.

         With Angelo to-night shall lie
         His old betrothed but despised;
         So disguise shall, by th' disguised,
         Pay with falsehood false exacting,
         And perform an old contracting.
 Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;
    Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
    Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
          Exit BOY
    I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish
    You had not found me here so musical.
 'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
    To make bad good and good provoke to harm.

  MARIANA.
 I do constantly believe you.
 The time is come even now.
 May be I will call upon
    you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
 Very well met, and well come.
 He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
    Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
    And to that vineyard is a planched gate
    That makes his opening with this bigger key;
    This other doth command a little door  
    Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.

  DUKE.
 But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
  ISABELLA.
 I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;
    With whispering and most guilty diligence,
    In action all of precept, he did show me
    The way twice o'er.

  DUKE.

  ISABELLA.
 Fear me not.

  DUKE.
       Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet
    I will be content to be a lawful hangman.
 I would be glad to
    receive some instructions from my fellow partner.
 What ho, Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there?

                          Enter ABHORSON  

  ABHORSON.
 Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn the
    scale.
                                                  Exit
  POMPEY.

  ABHORSON.
 Proof?  
  ABHORSON.

  PROVOST.

  ABHORSON.

  PROVOST.
 Where's Barnardine?
  CLAUDIO.
 As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
    When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.

    He will not wake.
 Who can do good on him?
    Well, go, prepare yourself.
 No.
 There he must stay until the officer
    Arise to let him in; he is call'd up.
 As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
    You shall hear more ere morning.

  PROVOST.
 I shall obey him.
 I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine
    office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks
    strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.

  PROVOST.
'
    What say you to this, sir?
  DUKE.
 It is now apparent?
  PROVOST.

  DUKE.
 He wants advice.

  PROVOST.
 We have very oft
    awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a
    seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.
 More of him anon.
 To
    make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four
    days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
    a dangerous courtesy.
 In the delaying death.

  DUKE.
 Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

  DUKE.
 Yet since I see you  
    fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can
    with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck
    all fears out of you.
 Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of
    the Duke.
 You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is
    not strange to you.
 Look, th'
    unfolding star calls up the shepherd.
 Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall
    absolutely resolve you.
 Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead.

    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
    Lord's sake.
 What ho, Barnardine!
  BARNARDINE.
 [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
    there? What are you?
  POMPEY.

  ABHORSON.


                  Enter DUKE, disguised as before

  ABHORSON.
 Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
    my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
 O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
    Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
    Prefix'd by Angelo.
 Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.

                                                    Exit PROVOST
    Now will I write letters to Angelo-
    The Provost, he shall bear them- whose contents
    Shall witness to him I am near at home,
    And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
    To enter publicly.
 Him I'll desire
    To meet me at the consecrated fount,
    A league below the city; and from thence,
    By cold gradation and well-balanc'd form.
 Convenient is it.
 I'll make all speed.

  ISABELLA.
 The better, given me by so holy a man.
 He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.

    His head is off and sent to Angelo.

    Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience,
  ISABELLA.

    The Duke comes home to-morrow.

    Say, by this token, I desire his company  
    At Mariana's house to-night.
                                         Exit ISABELLA
  DUKE.
 Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
    but the best is, he lives not in them.
 If bawdy
    talk offend you, we'll have very little of it.
                          Exeunt




SCENE IV.

  ANGELO.
 A deflow'red maid!
    And by an eminent body that enforc'd
    The law against it! But that her tender shame
    Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
    How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
    For my authority bears a so credent bulk
    That no particular scandal once can touch
    But it confounds the breather.

Fields without the town

Enter DUKE in his own habit, and Friar PETER

  DUKE.
 Go, call at Flavius' house,
    And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
    But send me Flavius first.

A street near the city gate

Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA

  ISABELLA.
 Yet I am advis'd to do it;
    He says, to veil full purpose.
 Be rul'd by him.
 O, peace! the friar is come.
 SCENE I.

    We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
    Such goodness of your justice that our soul
    Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
    Forerunning more requital.
 Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.
 Relate your wrongs.

    Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice;
    Reveal yourself to him.

  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.
 Nay, it is ten times strange.

  DUKE.

  ISABELLA.

  DUKE.
 O gracious Duke,
    Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
    For inequality; but let your reason serve
    To make the truth appear where it seems hid,  
    And hide the false seems true.

    I, in probation of a sisterhood,
    Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
    As then the messenger-
  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.

  DUKE.
 Proceed.
 I went
    To this pernicious caitiff deputy.

  DUKE.
 And is this all?
    Then, O you blessed ministers above,
    Keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,  
    Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
    In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
    As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
  DUKE.
 Who knows that Lodowick?
  LUCIO.
 But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
    I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,
    A very scurvy fellow.
  
  PETER.
 First, hath this woman
    Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;
    Who is as free from touch or soil with her
    As she from one ungot.

    Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
  PETER.

  LUCIO.

  PETER.
 First, for this woman-
    To justify this worthy nobleman,
    So vulgarly and personally accus'd-
    Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
    Till she herself confess it.

  DUKE.
 No, my lord.

  DUKE.
 No, my lord.

  DUKE.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.

  DUKE.
 Charges she moe than me?
  MARIANA.
 This is a strange abuse.
 Carnally, she says.
 Noble Prince,
    As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
    As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
    I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
    As words could make up vows.
 And, my good lord,  
    But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,
    He knew me as a wife.
 I do perceive
    These poor informal women are no more
    But instruments of some more mightier member
    That sets them on.

  DUKE.
 Would lie were here, my lord! For he indeed
    Hath set the women on to this complaint.

  ESCALUS.
 We shall find this friar a notable
    fellow.

  LUCIO.

  ESCALUS.

  LUCIO.
 That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

  ESCALUS.

  DUKE.
 'Tis false.

  ESCALUS.
 This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
 My business in this state
    Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
    Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
    Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults,
    But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
    Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
    As much in mock as mark.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for
    thy speeches?
  DUKE.
 I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.

  LUCIO.

  DUKE.
 [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down.

    We'll borrow place of him.

    Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
    That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
    Rely upon it till my tale be heard,  
    And hold no longer out.
 I was, my lord.
 My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour
    Than at the strangeness of it.
 As I was then
    Advertising and holy to your business,
    Not changing heart with habit, I am still
    Attorney'd at your service.

  DUKE.
  
  ISABELLA.

    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
    Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.

  DUKE.
 It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.

    Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
    I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
    For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
    And choke your good to come.
 Never crave him; we are definitive.

  MARIANA.

    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
  DUKE.
 My brother had but justice,
    In that he did the thing for which he died;
    For Angelo,  
    His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
    And must be buried but as an intent
    That perish'd by the way.

  MARIANA.
 Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
  
  DUKE.
      Exit PROVOST
  ESCALUS.
 There was a friar told me of this man.
 Friar, advise him;
    I leave him to your hand.
 But fitter time for that.

    If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would
    please you I might be whipt.
 Slandering a prince deserves it.

    Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;
    There's more behind that is more gratulate.

SCENE:
Venice, and PORTIA'S house at Belmont


ACT I.

    It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
    What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
    I am to learn;
    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
    That I have much ado to know myself.

  SALERIO.

    I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
    But I should think of shallows and of flats,
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
    Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
    To kiss her burial.

  ANTONIO.
 Fare ye well;
    We leave you now with better company.
 Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
  
  BASSANIO.

  GRATIANO.
 You look not well, Signior Antonio;
    You have too much respect upon the world;
    They lose it that do buy it with much care.
 I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
    A stage, where every man must play a part,
    And mine a sad one.

    But fish not with this melancholy bait
    For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.

  LORENZO.

  ANTONIO.
 I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
    And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
    Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
    My purse, my person, my extremest means,
    Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

  ANTONIO.
 You know me well, and herein spend but time
    To wind about my love with circumstance;
    And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
    In making question of my uttermost
    Than if you had made waste of all I have.

  BASSANIO.

    Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd
    To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

  ANTONIO.

    Go presently inquire, and so will I,
    Where money is; and I no question make
    To have it of my trust or for my sake.
                Exeunt





SCENE II.

Belmont.

  NERISSA.
 Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.

  NERISSA.
 It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I
    can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one
    of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.

  PORTIA.
 He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
    not have me, choose.
' He hears merry tales and smiles not.

  NERISSA.
 I
    will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.

  PORTIA.

  NERISSA.


                         Enter a SERVINGMAN

    How now! what news?
  SERVINGMAN.
 The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
    leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of
    Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here
    to-night.
 A public place

Enter BASSANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew

  SHYLOCK.

  SHYLOCK.
 For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

  SHYLOCK.
 The man is, notwithstanding,
    sufficient.

  SHYLOCK.
 If it please you to dine with us.
 Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
    prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I will buy with
    you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so
    following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray
    with you.

    If I can catch him once upon the hip,
    I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
  [To BASSANIO]  Is he yet possess'd
    How much ye would?
  SHYLOCK.
 And for three months.
 I had forgot- three months; you told me so.

    Was this inserted to make interest good?
    Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  SHYLOCK.

  ANTONIO.

    O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
  SHYLOCK.
 Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
  SHYLOCK.

    Well then, it now appears you need my help;
    Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
    'Shylock, we would have moneys.

    If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
    As to thy friends- for when did friendship take
    A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
    But lend it rather to thine enemy,
    Who if he break thou mayst with better face
    Exact the penalty.
 You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
    I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
 Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
    Within these two months- that's a month before  
    This bond expires- I do expect return
    Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

  SHYLOCK.
 I say,
    To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;
    If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
    And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

  ANTONIO.
 Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
    My ships come home a month before the day.

Belmont.
 I would not change this hue,
    Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
 Even for that I thank you.
 First, forward to the temple.

  PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.
' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack.
' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.
' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with  
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself.
 The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel.
 I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.
 Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
    now; now will I raise the waters.
- Talk you of young Master
    Launcelot?
  GOBBO.

  LAUNCELOT.

  GOBBO.
 Talk not of Master Launcelot,
    father; for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies
    and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of  
    learning, is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain
    terms, gone to heaven.

  GOBBO.
 Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
    me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son
    that is, your child that shall be.
 I cannot think you are my son.

  LAUNCELOT.
 I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs.
 Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground.
 O rare  
    fortune! Here comes the man.


         Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO, with a FOLLOWER or two

  BASSANIO.

  BASSANIO.
 One speak for both.

  LAUNCELOT.
 The old proverb is very well parted between my master
    Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath
    enough.

  BASSANIO.

  LEONARDO.
 My best endeavours shall be done herein.

  
                          Enter GRATIANO

  GRATIANO.
 Where's your master?
  LEONARDO.
 Signior Bassanio!
  BASSANIO.
 Why, then you must.
 But hear thee, Gratiano:
    Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-
    Parts that become thee happily enough,
    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
    But where thou art not known, why there they show
    Something too liberal.
 Well, we shall see your bearing.

  GRATIANO.

  BASSANIO.
                 Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Most beautiful pagan,
    most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get
    thee, I am much deceived.

Venice.
 Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
    Disguise us at my lodging, and return
    All in an hour.
 I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
    And whiter than the paper it writ on  
    Is the fair hand that writ.
 Whither goest thou?
  LAUNCELOT.
 Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
    to-night with my new master, the Christian.

    Go, gentlemen,                                Exit LAUNCELOT
    Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?
    I am provided of a torch-bearer.

  SOLANIO.
 And so will I.
 I must needs tell thee all.

    Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;
    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
                Exeunt




SCENE V.
 Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
    The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

  LAUNCELOT.
 Jessica, my girl,
    Look to my house.
 I am right loath to go;
    There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
    For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

  LAUNCELOT.

    Do as I bid you, shut doors after you.
                  Exit
  JESSICA.
 Before SHYLOCK'S house

Enter the maskers, GRATIANO and SALERIO

  GRATIANO.

  GRATIANO.
 And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
    For lovers ever run before the clock.

    How like a younker or a prodigal
    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
    Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind;  
    How like the prodigal doth she return,
    With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
    Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

                       Enter LORENZO

  SALERIO.

  LORENZO.
 Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.

  JESSICA.
 I will make fast the doors, and gild myself  
    With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.

                                                      Exit above

  GRATIANO.
 Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
    For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
    And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself;
    And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
 Who's there?  
  GRATIANO.
 PORTIA's house

Flourish of cornets.
 Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO,
and their trains

  PORTIA.
'
    This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt:
    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.

    If thou beest rated by thy estimation,
    Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough
    May not extend so far as to the lady;
    And yet to be afeard of my deserving
    Were but a weak disabling of myself.

    Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd,
    Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
    O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
    Was set in worse than gold.
 O hell! what have we here?
    A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
    There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.

         Gilded tombs do worms infold.
'
      Cold indeed, and labour lost,
      Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.

  SOLANIO.
 I never heard a passion so confus'd,
    So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
    As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.

    'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
    Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
    Justice! the law! My ducats and my daughter!  
    A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
    Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!
    And jewels- two stones, two rich and precious stones,
    Stol'n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl;
    She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.
 Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
    Or he shall pay for this.

  SOLANIO.


       Flourish of cornets.
 To these injunctions every one doth swear
    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
 Fortune now
    To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.
'
    What many men desire- that 'many' may be meant
    By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
    Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
    Which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet,
    Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
    Even in the force and road of casualty.
  
    Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!
    Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.

                                    [He opens the silver casket]  
  PORTIA.
  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.

  ARRAGON.
 What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
    Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.

    How much unlike art thou to Portia!
    How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
    'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.
'

         Still more fool I shall appear
         By the time I linger here.
 The ancient saying is no heresy:
    Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
 Yet I have not seen
    So likely an ambassador of love.
 No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
    Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
    Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
>>



ACT III.
 But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or
    crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
    honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his name
    company!-
  SALERIO.

  SALERIO.
 I would it might prove the end of his losses.

  SOLANIO.
 And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
    and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.

  SHYLOCK.
 That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
 I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
 He
    was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond.

  SALERIO.
 Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to
    speak with you both.

                                Exeunt SOLANIO, SALERIO, and MAN
  SHYLOCK.

  SHYLOCK.
 I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
 I thank thee, good Tubal.
 Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
  TUBAL.

  SHYLOCK.
 It was my
    turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not
    have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.

Belmont.
 PORTIA'S house

Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and all their trains

  PORTIA.
 Prove it so,
    Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

    I speak too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
    To eke it, and to draw it out in length,
    To stay you from election.

  PORTIA.
 Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
    What treason there is mingled with your love.

  PORTIA.

  BASSANIO.
 'Confess' and 'love'
    Had been the very sum of my confession.
 Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them.
 Go, Hercules!
    Live thou, I live.


                            A SONG

      the whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself

                 Tell me where is fancy bred,
                 Or in the heart or in the head,
                 How begot, how nourished?
                   Reply, reply.

  ALL.
  [Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,  
    As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair,
    And shudd'ring fear, and green-ey'd jealousy!
    O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,
    In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!
    I feel too much thy blessing.
 Make it less,
    For fear I surfeit.
  [Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
    Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
    Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
    Or whether riding on the balls of mine
    Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
    Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar
    Should sunder such sweet friends.

         'You that choose not by the view,
         Chance as fair and choose as true!
         Since this fortune falls to you,
         Be content and seek no new.

         If you be well pleas'd with this,
         And hold your fortune for your bliss,
         Turn to where your lady is
         And claim her with a loving kiss.
 Though for myself alone
    I would not be ambitious in my wish
    To wish myself much better, yet for you
    I would be trebled twenty times myself,
    A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
    That only to stand high in your account
    I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,
    Exceed account.
 I give them with this ring,
    Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
    Let it presage the ruin of your love,
    And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

  GRATIANO.

    My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
    You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
    You lov'd, I lov'd; for intermission
    No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.

    Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,
    And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
    For wooing here until I sweat again,
    And swearing till my very roof was dry
    With oaths of love, at last- if promise last-
    I got a promise of this fair one here
    To have her love, provided that your fortune  
    Achiev'd her mistress.
 Is this true, Nerissa?
  NERISSA.
 Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
 Yes, faith, my lord.

  BASSANIO.

  GRATIANO.
 We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand
    ducats.
 I did, my lord,
    And I have reason for it.
 I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
 When I told you
    My state was nothing, I should then have told you  
    That I was worse than nothing; for indeed
    I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,
    Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,
    To feed my means.
 Here is a letter, lady,
    The paper as the body of my friend,
    And every word in it a gaping wound
    Issuing life-blood.
 But is it true, Salerio?
    Hath all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
    From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,
    From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
    And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
    Of merchant-marring rocks?
  SALERIO.
 Not one, my lord.

    Besides, it should appear that, if he had
    The present money to discharge the Jew,
    He would not take it.
 Never did I know
    A creature that did bear the shape of man
    So keen and greedy to confound a man.

    He plies the Duke at morning and at night,
    And doth impeach the freedom of the state,  
    If they deny him justice.

    First go with me to church and call me wife,
    And then away to Venice to your friend;
    For never shall you lie by Portia's side
    With an unquiet soul.
 You shall have gold
    To pay the petty debt twenty times over.

    But let me hear the letter of your friend.
 O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
  BASSANIO.
 Since I have your good leave to go away,
    I will make haste; but, till I come again,
    No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
    Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
 A street

Enter SHYLOCK, SOLANIO, ANTONIO, and GAOLER

  SHYLOCK.
 Tell not me of mercy-
    This is the fool that lent out money gratis.

    Gaoler, look to him.

  SHYLOCK.
 I will not hear thee speak;
    I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.

  ANTONIO.

    He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
    I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
    Many that have at times made moan to me;
    Therefore he hates me.
 I am sure the Duke
    Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
  
    Well, gaoler, on; pray God Bassanio come
    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
          Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 I do desire you
    Not to deny this imposition,
    The which my love and some necessity
    Now lays upon you.

  LORENZO.

  PORTIA.
 I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
    To wish it back on you.
 Fare you well, Jessica.
 Take this same letter,
    And use thou all th' endeavour of a man
    In speed to Padua; see thou render this
    Into my cousin's hands, Doctor Bellario;
    And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,
    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed
    Unto the traject, to the common ferry
    Which trades to Venice.
         Exit
  PORTIA.
 Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand
    That you yet know not of; we'll see our husbands
    Before they think of us.
 Why, shall we turn to men?
  PORTIA.
 Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
    be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you.
 There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and
    that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither.
 And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT.
 This
    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all
    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the
    coals for money.

  LAUNCELOT.
 How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
    grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow
    commendable in none only but parrots.

  LORENZO.
 It is very meet
    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,
    For, having such a blessing in his lady,
    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
    And if on earth he do not merit it,
    In reason he should never come to heaven.

    Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,
    And on the wager lay two earthly women,
    And Portia one, there must be something else
    Pawn'd with the other; for the poor rude world
    Hath not her fellow.

  JESSICA.
 Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
 I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
                      Exeunt




ACT IV.
 What, is Antonio here?
  ANTONIO.
 Ready, so please your Grace.

  SALERIO.
  

                          Enter SHYLOCK

  DUKE OF VENICE.
 Make room, and let him stand before our face.

  SHYLOCK.
 Every offence is not a hate at first.
 What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
  ANTONIO.
 I pray you, think you question with the Jew.

    You may as well go stand upon the beach
    And bid the main flood bate his usual height;  
    You may as well use question with the wolf,
    Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
    You may as well forbid the mountain pines
    To wag their high tops and to make no noise
    When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
    You may as well do anything most hard
    As seek to soften that- than which what's harder?-
    His jewish heart.

  BASSANIO.

  BASSANIO.
 Bellario greets your Grace.
 Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  SHYLOCK.
 Can no prayers pierce thee?
  SHYLOCK.
 Thy currish spirit
    Govern'd a wolf who, hang'd for human slaughter,
    Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
    And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,
    Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires
    Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd and ravenous.

  SHYLOCK.

  DUKE OF VENICE.
 This letter from Bellario doth commend
    A young and learned doctor to our court.
 Some three or four of you
    Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
 You are welcome; take your place.
 Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

  PORTIA.
 Is your name Shylock?
  SHYLOCK.
 Therefore, Jew,
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this-
    That in the course of justice none of us
    Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
    The deeds of mercy.

  BASSANIO.

  PORTIA.
 A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
    O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!  
  PORTIA.

    Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
    No, not for Venice.

    Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
 When it is paid according to the tenour.

    It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
    You know the law; your exposition
    Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law,
    Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
    Proceed to judgment.

  PORTIA.

  SHYLOCK.
 For the intent and purpose of the law
    Hath full relation to the penalty,
    Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
 Ay, his breast-
    So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge?
    'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words.
 Are there balance here to weigh
    The flesh?
  SHYLOCK.
 Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
    If she were by to hear you make the offer.

  NERISSA.

  SHYLOCK.
 Most rightful judge!
  PORTIA.
 And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.

  GRATIANO.
 Shall I not have barely my principal?
  PORTIA.
 Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
    To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

    The law hath yet another hold on you.

    Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
 A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
  ANTONIO.
 He shall do this, or else I do recant
    The pardon that I late pronounced here.
 Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
  SHYLOCK.

  PORTIA.

  SHYLOCK.
 Get thee gone, but do it.
 Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
    Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
    Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof
    Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
    We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
  
  ANTONIO.
 He is well paid that is well satisfied,
    And I, delivering you, am satisfied,
    And therein do account myself well paid.

    I pray you, know me when we meet again;
    I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

  BASSANIO.
 Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
    Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
    Not as fee.
 Grant me two things, I pray you,
    Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
 I will have nothing else but only this;  
    And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.

    The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
    And find it out by proclamation;
    Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

  PORTIA.

    And if your wife be not a mad woman,
    And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,
    She would not hold out enemy for ever
    For giving it to me.
 My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
 Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
    Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
    Unto Antonio's house.
        Exit GRATIANO
    Come, you and I will thither presently;
    And in the morning early will we both
    Fly toward Belmont.

    This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
 Furthermore,
    I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.

  GRATIANO.

  NERISSA.
 Sir, I would speak with you.
  
    [Aside to PORTIA]  I'll See if I can get my husband's ring,
    Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

Belmont.

  JESSICA.

  LORENZO.
 In such a night
    Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
    That did renew old AEson.

  JESSICA.
 In such a night
    Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,
    Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
    And ne'er a true one.

  LORENZO.

  JESSICA.
 Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  STEPHANO.

  LORENZO.
 Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
    sola!
  LORENZO.
       Exit STEPHANO
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
 Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
                        [Music]
  JESSICA.

  LORENZO.

    Let no such man be trusted.
 That light we see is burning in my hall.
 When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
 So doth the greater glory dim the less:
    A substitute shines brightly as a king
    Until a king be by, and then his state
    Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
    Into the main of waters.

  PORTIA.

  PORTIA.


       Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers

  BASSANIO.
 I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.

  PORTIA.

    Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
    Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
'
  NERISSA.
 He will, an if he live to be a man.
 Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
    A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
    No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk;
    A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
    I could not for my heart deny it him.

  PORTIA.
 Even so void is your false heart of truth;
    By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
    Until I see the ring.

    Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
 And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
    How you do leave me to mine own protection.
 I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
 Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
    And in the hearing of these many friends
    I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
    Wherein I see myself-
  PORTIA.
 I once did lend my body for his wealth,
    Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
    Had quite miscarried; I dare be bound again,
    My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
    Will never more break faith advisedly.

  ANTONIO.

  BASSANIO.
 By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
  PORTIA.

  NERISSA.
 And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
    For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
    In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.

    What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
  PORTIA.
 The first inter'gatory
    That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
    Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
    Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
 Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
    hundred years.

  SHALLOW.
 The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old
    coat.
 It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
 Not a whit.
 The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.
 Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword  
    should end it.

 How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say
    he was outrun on Cotsall.
 'Tis your fault; 'tis your fault;
    'tis a good dog.
 Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office
    between you.
 Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
 If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that  
    so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; indeed he hath; at a
    word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith
    he is wronged.
 Here comes Sir John.
 Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
 Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your

 Ay, it is no matter.
 Peace, I pray you.
 Now let us understand.

 Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
 O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
 How now, Mistress Ford!

 Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will

  SLENDER.

  SHALLOW.
 Ay, there's the point, sir.
 Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
    reasonable demands.
 Therefore,
    precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?
  SHALLOW.
 Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable,
    if you can carry her your desires towards her.

  SHALLOW.
 I will do a greater thing than that upon your request,
    cousin, in any reason.
 But if you say
    'marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved,
    and dissolutely.
 No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very
    well.

  SLENDER.
 Go,
    sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin
  Shallow.
 But what though?

 Discard, bully Hercules; cashier; let them wag; trot,

 Do so, good mine host.
 I am at a word; follow.
 Bardolph, follow him.
 Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's wife; I
    spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves, she
    gives the leer of invitation; I can construe the action of her
    familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be
    English'd rightly, is 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.
 He hath studied her well, and translated her will out
    of honesty into English.
 The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?
  FALSTAFF.
 As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
 The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.
  
  NYM.
 I thank thee for that humour.

  FALSTAFF.
 Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
    And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!
  NYM.
 Here, take the

 My humour shall not cool; I will incense Page to deal
    with poison; I will possess him with yellowness; for the  
    revolt of mine is dangerous.
 That is my true humour.

SCENE 4.
  [Exit RUGBY]  An
    honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in

    something peevish that way; but nobody but has his fault;
    but let that pass.
 Peter Simple you say your name is?

 Ay, for fault of a better.

 Ay, forsooth.

 In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and

 Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but
    notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book
    she loves you.
 Well, I shall see her to-day.
 If thou seest
    her before me, commend me.
 Will I? I' faith, that we will; and I will tell your
    worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence;
    and of other wooers.

 You are merry, so am I; ha! ha! then there's
    more sympathy.
 How shall I be

    to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition
    would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no
    more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth
    Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves.

 Well, I hope it be not so.
 Love my wife!

    Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

  FORD.
 My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.

 I melancholy! I am not melancholy.
 Get you home;

 You'll come to dinner, George?

 Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?

  HOST.
 Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaleiro.
 It is a merry
    knight.
 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,  
    'tis here.
 I had rather hear them scold than
    fight.
 I will not lend thee a penny.
 Which I with
    sword will open.
 Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  FALSTAFF.

  QUICKLY.
 I pray your worship
    come a little nearer this ways.
 Lord, Lord, your
    worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of
    us, I pray.

    I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I
    defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the
    way of honesty; and, I warrant you, they could never get
    her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all;  
    and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more,
    pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
 Ten and eleven.
 But I have another messenger
    to your worship.
 I never knew a woman so
    dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes,
    in truth.

  FALSTAFF.
 But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
    Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
  QUICKLY.
 Why, I will.

  QUICKLY.

  PISTOL.
 I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
    you.
 Good Sir John, I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I
    must let you understand I think myself in better plight for
    a lender than you are; the which hath something
    embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they say, if
    money go before, all ways do lie open.

  FORD.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.

  FORD.
 Well, sir.
 To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
  FORD.

  FALSTAFF.
 O, sir!
  FORD.
 Believe it, for you know it.

  FORD.

    Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand,
    my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves;
    I could drive her then from the ward of her purity,  
    her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her
    defences, which now are too too strongly embattl'd against
    me.
 What say you to't, Sir John?
  FALSTAFF.
 Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
 Come you to me at
    night; you shall know how I speed.
 Do you know Ford,
    Sir?
  FALSTAFF.
 Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
    stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel;
    it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns.

    Come to me soon at night.
 What a damn'd Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
    ready to crack with impatience.
 Who says this is improvident
    jealousy? My wife hath sent to him; the hour is fix'd;
    the match is made.
 But cuckold! Wittol! Cuckold! the devil himself
    hath not such a name.
 Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust
    his wife; he will not be jealous; I will rather trust a Fleming
    with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my
    cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to
    walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself.
 Jack Rugby!
  RUGBY.
 He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill
    him if he came.
 By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him.

  RUGBY.
 Villainy, take your rapier.

  HOST.
 I pray you, bear witness that me have stay six or
    seven, two tree hours for him, and he is no come.
 He is the wiser man, Master Doctor: he is a curer

    you go against the hair of your professions.

    and give him another hope, to betray him to another
    punishment?

 We will do it; let him be sent for to-morrow

    and butter'd, and give them to a dog for a new-year's gift.
 Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames
    water; for my belly's as cold as if I had swallow'd
    snowballs for pills to cool the reins.
 By your leave; I cry you mercy.
 Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
    your heart to see it.
 Her husband goes this morning
    a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her between
    eight and nine; I must carry her word quickly.
 Tell her so; and bid her
    think what a man is.
 Eight and nine, sir.

 Well, be gone; I will not miss her.
 I like his money well.

 Peace your tattlings.
 What is 'fair,' William?

 Polecats! There are fairer things than polecats,
    sure.

    What is 'lapis,' William?

 Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be

 O-vocativo, O.

  MRS.

  MRS.
 Why?
  MRS.
 He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
    against all married mankind; so curses an Eve's daughters,
    of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the
    forehead, crying 'Peer-out, peer-out!' that any madness I
    ever yet beheld seem'd but tameness, civility, and patience,
    to this his distemper he is in now.

  MRS.
 PAGE.
 FORD.
 No, I'll come no more i' th' basket.
 Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the
    door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you
    might slip away ere he came.
 What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.

  MRS.
 There they always use to discharge their
    birding-pieces.
 Creep into the kiln-hole.
 FORD.
 Neither press,  
    coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for
    the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his
    note.

  FALSTAFF.
 FORD.
 Good hearts, devise something; any extremity
    rather than a mischief.

  MRS.

  MRS.

 Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and
    the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!

 We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry
    the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they
    did last time.

 Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders;
    your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey

    Pluck me out all the linen.

  FORD.
 No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.

  MRS.
 What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old
    woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.

  FORD.
 A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
    forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We
    are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass
    under the profession of fortune-telling.
 We know nothing.

  MRS.
 PAGE.
 What think you? May we, with the warrant of
    womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue
    him with any further revenge?
  MRS.
 Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
    figures out of your husband's brains.
 If they can find in their
    hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further
    afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.

Enter HOST and BARDOLPH

 FORD.

  PAGE.
 Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,
    And in this shape.
 That likewise have we thought upon, and
    thus:
    Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,
    And three or four more of their growth, we'll dress
    Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,
    With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
    And rattles in their hands; upon a sudden,
    As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met,
    Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
    With some diffused song; upon their sight  
    We two in great amazedness will fly.

  MRS.

 Nay, I'll to him again, in name of Brook;

  HOST.
 There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into
    his chamber; I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down;
    I come to speak with her, indeed.

  HOST.
 I'll call.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress
    Anne Page: to know if it were my master's fortune to
    have her or no.

  HOST.
 Where is mine host?
  HOST.
 There is a friend
    of mine come to town tells me there is three  
    cozen-germans that has cozen'd all the hosts of Readins,
    of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money.
 Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

 The devil take one party and his dam the other!
    And so they shall be both bestowed.
 But
    that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the
    action of an old woman, deliver'd me, the knave constable
    had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' common stocks, for a witch.
 Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
  FENTON.

SCENE 2.

 They are all couch'd in a pit hard by Heme's
    oak, with obscur'd lights; which, at the very instant of
    Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once display to the
    night.
 That cannot choose but amaze him.

  MRS.
 Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts.
 Come, come; trib,

Another part of the Park

Enter FALSTAFF disguised as HERNE

  FALSTAFF.

    rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?
    Who comes here? my doe?

        Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE  

  MRS.
 Alas, what noise?
  MRS.
 What should this be?
  MRS.
 } Away, away.
 Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
    You moonshine revellers, and shades of night,
    You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
    Attend your office and your quality.

    Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
 Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
 They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die.
 About, about;
    Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out;
    Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room,
    That it may stand till the perpetual doom
    In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
    Worthy the owner and the owner it.

    Away, disperse; but till 'tis one o'clock,
    Our dance of custom round about the oak
    Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.
 I smell a man of middle earth.
 Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
    transform me to a piece of cheese!
  PUCK.

    Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
    Pinch him for his villainy;
    Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,
    Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.


        During this song they pinch FALSTAFF.

        FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises

       Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and
                        SIR HUGH EVANS

  PAGE.
 Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.

  FALSTAFF.

  EVANS.

  FORD.
 Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would
    have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and
    shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
    that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
  FORD.
 What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
  MRS.
 Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails?
  FORD.
 Well, I am your theme; you have the start of me;
    I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;
    ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me; use me as you will.
 I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne
    Page, and she's a great lubberly boy.

  PAGE.

  PAGE.
 Good George, be not angry.
 I knew of your
    purpose; turn'd my daughter into green; and, indeed, she
    is now with the Doctor at the dean'ry, and there married.

  PAGE.

    You would have married her most shamefully,  
    Where there was no proportion held in love.

    Th' offence is holy that she hath committed;
    And this deceit loses the name of craft,
    Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
    Since therein she doth evitate and shun
    A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
    Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

    In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state;
    Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

  FALSTAFF.

    As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
    My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
    If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
    And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
    I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia.

  THESEUS.

  EGEUS.
 With duty and desire we follow you.
 Belike for want of rain, which I could well  
    Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
 O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

  LYSANDER.
 O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.

  LYSANDER.

  LYSANDER.

    Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
 His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
 Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
    To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
    Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,
    Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
    A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
    Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.

    But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
    He will not know what all but he do know.

  QUINCE.

  BOTTOM.
 Name what part I am for, and proceed.
 A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
 If I
    do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I
    will condole in some measure.
 I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat
    in, to make all split.
 What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?

  QUINCE.
 I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out
    of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us;
    but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently
    as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.
 Well, I will undertake it.

  QUINCE.
 We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and
    courageously.
 Take pains; be perfect; adieu.

A wood near Athens

Enter a FAIRY at One door, and PUCK at another

  PUCK.
      Over hill, over dale,
                Thorough bush, thorough brier,
              Over park, over pale,
                Thorough flood, thorough fire,
              I do wander every where,
              Swifter than the moon's sphere;
              And I serve the Fairy Queen,
              To dew her orbs upon the green.

  PUCK.

    And now they never meet in grove or green,
    By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
    But they do square, that all their elves for fear
    Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
 Are not you he
    That frights the maidens of the villagery,
    Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,  
    And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
    And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
    Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
    Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
    You do their work, and they shall have good luck.

    The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
    Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
    Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
    And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
    And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,  
    And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
    A merrier hour was never wasted there.
 Would that he were gone!

       Enter OBERON at one door, with his TRAIN, and TITANIA,
                        at another, with hers

  OBERON.
 Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
 Why art thou here,
    Come from the farthest steep of India,
    But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
    Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,  
    To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
    To give their bed joy and prosperity?
  OBERON.

    The human mortals want their winter here;
    No night is now with hymn or carol blest;
    Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
    Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
    That rheumatic diseases do abound.

    But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
    And for her sake do I rear up her boy;
    And for her sake I will not part with him.
 Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
 Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
 Fairies, away.

    We shall chide downright if I longer stay.

  PUCK.

    And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
    As I can take it with another herb,
    I'll make her render up her page to me.
 I will not stay thy questions; let me go;
    Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
    But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
 Fie, Demetrius!
    Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
 Ay, there it is.

    I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
    Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
    Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
    With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine;
    There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
    Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
    And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
    Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;
    And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
    And make her full of hateful fantasies.
 Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so.
 Come now, a roundel and a fairy song;
    Then, for the third part of a minute, hence:
    Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
    Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
    To make my small elves coats; and some keep back
    The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
    At our quaint spirits.
  
               Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.

  SECOND FAIRY.
  Weaving spiders, come not here;
                 Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence.

               One aloof stand sentinel.
          Exeunt FAIRIES

      Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA'S eyelids

  OBERON.
 What thou seest when thou dost wake,
    Do it for thy true-love take;
    Love and languish for his sake.
 Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,
    For I upon this bank will rest my head.
 One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
    One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.

  HERMIA.

    I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,
    So that but one heart we can make of it;  
    Two bosoms interchained with an oath,
    So then two bosoms and a single troth.
 Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;
    And then end life when I end loyalty!
    Here is my bed; sleep give thee all his rest!
  HERMIA.
 O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
    The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.

    Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies,
    For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.

  LYSANDER.

    Things growing are not ripe until their season;
    So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
    And touching now the point of human skill,
    Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
    And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook  
    Love's stories, written in Love's richest book.
 Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
    When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
    Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
    That I did never, no, nor never can,
    Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
    But you must flout my insufficiency?
    Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
    In such disdainful manner me to woo.

    Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!
    Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
 TITANIA lying asleep

Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

  BOTTOM.

  BOTTOM.
 I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
    done.

  BOTTOM.
 Write me a
    prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
    with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed; and for  
    the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not
    Pyramus but Bottom the weaver.

  BOTTOM.

  SNOUT.
 Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

  BOTTOM.
  
  QUINCE.
 But there is two hard things- that
    is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus
    and Thisby meet by moonlight.
 Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
  BOTTOM.

  QUINCE.

  SNOUT.
 You can never bring in a wall.
 Pyramus, you begin; when
    you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every
    one according to his cue.
 Speak, Pyramus.

  FLUTE.
 Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
    Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
    Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
    As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
    I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
 Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is 'never tire.
 O- As true as truest horse, that y et would never tire.
 If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.


                          Re-enter SNOUT

  SNOUT.
 What do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?
                                                      Exit SNOUT

                          Re-enter QUINCE

  QUINCE.

 Exit
  BOTTOM.
 I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to
    fright me, if they could.
                     [Sings]

          The ousel cock, so black of hue,
            With orange-tawny bill,
          The throstle with his note so true,
            The wren with little quill.
 Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

  BOTTOM.

  COBWEB.

  MOTH.
 And I.
 And I.
 Where shall we go?
  TITANIA.

    Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
 Hail!
  BOTTOM.
 Cobweb.

  BOTTOM.

Another part of the wood

Enter OBERON

  OBERON.
 How now, mad spirit!
    What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
  PUCK.
 Would he have stolen away
    From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon  
    This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon
    May through the centre creep and so displease
    Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes.
 So should the murdered look; and so should I,
    Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty;
    Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
    As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
 A privilege never to see me more.

  PUCK.
 About the wood go swifter than the wind,
    And Helena of Athens look thou find;
    All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
    With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.

  PUCK.
 The noise they make
                Will cause Demetrius to awake.

    How can these things in me seem scorn to you,  
    Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
  HELENA.
 I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
 Helen, it is not so.


                       Enter HERMIA

  HERMIA.
 Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  HERMIA.
 What love could press Lysander from my side?
  LYSANDER.

    Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know
    The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
  HERMIA.

  HELENA.
 Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,  
    To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
    And made your other love, Demetrius,
    Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
    To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
    Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
    To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander
    Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
    And tender me, forsooth, affection,
    But by your setting on, by your consent?
    What though I be not so in grace as you,
    So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
    But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
    This you should pity rather than despise.
 O excellent!
  HERMIA.

  DEMETRIUS.

  LYSANDER.
 If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
 Quick, come.
 Away, you Ethiope!
  DEMETRIUS.
 Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
    Sweet love?
  LYSANDER.
 Yes, sooth; and so do you.

  HERMIA.

    Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me.

  HERMIA.

    How low am I? I am not yet so low
    But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

  HELENA.

  HERMIA.
 Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
  HELENA.

  LYSANDER.
 Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

  DEMETRIUS.
 No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

  HERMIA.

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.

    Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
    My legs are longer though, to run away.
                 Exit
  HERMIA.
 Damned spirits all
    That in cross-ways and floods have burial,
    Already to their wormy beds are gone,
    For fear lest day should look their shames upon;
    They wilfully themselves exil'd from light,
    And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
 Where art thou?
  LYSANDER.
 He goes before me, and still dares me on;
    When I come where he calls, then he is gone.

    The villain is much lighter heel'd than I.
 [Lies down] Come, thou gentle day.
 Come hither; I am here.

  DEMETRIUS.
              [Sleeps]
  PUCK.
  
    Here will I rest me till the break of day.

    Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

  PUCK.
 LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA, lying asleep

Enter TITANIA and Bottom; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSEED,
and other FAIRIES attending;
                      OBERON behind, unseen

  TITANIA.
 Come, sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed,
    While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
    And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
    And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
 Where's Peaseblossom?
  PEASEBLOSSOM.
 Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
 Mounsieur Cobweb; good mounsieur, get you your weapons in
    your hand and kill me a red-hipp'd humble-bee on the top of a
    thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag.
 I must to the barber's, mounsieur; for methinks I am
    marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if
    my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
 What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
  BOTTOM.
 Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.

  TITANIA.
 [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.

    And now I have the boy, I will undo
    This hateful imperfection of her eyes.

  TITANIA.

  OBERON.
 Robin, take off this head.
 Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!
  PUCK.

  PUCK.
           Exeunt

        To the winding of horns, enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA,

  THESEUS.

    Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
 My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
    And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
    This Helena, old Nedar's Helena.
 No doubt they rose up early to observe
    The rite of May; and, hearing our intent,
    Came here in grace of our solemnity.

    But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
    That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
  EGEUS.
 It is, my lord.
 Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
 Pardon, my lord.
 I pray you all, stand up.

    I know you two are rival enemies;
    How comes this gentle concord in the world  
    That hatred is so far from jealousy
    To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
  LYSANDER.
 Our intent
    Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
    Without the peril of the Athenian law-
  EGEUS.
 Enough, enough, my Lord; you have enough;
    I beg the law, the law upon his head.
  
    But, my good lord, I wot not by what power-
    But by some power it is- my love to Hermia,
    Melted as the snow, seems to me now
    As the remembrance of an idle gaud
    Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
    And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
    The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
    Is only Helena.
  
    Away with us to Athens, three and three;
    We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.

                     Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train
  DEMETRIUS.

  HERMIA.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Do not you think
    The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?
  HERMIA.
 Yea, and my father.

  HELENA.
 And he did bid us follow to the temple.
 [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.

    Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at
    her death.
 QUINCE'S house

Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

  QUINCE.
 He cannot be heard of.
 You have not a man in all Athens able
    to discharge Pyramus but he.
 O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
    during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day.
 An the
    Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll
    be hanged.
 Not a word of me.
 SCENE I.

Athens.


          Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA

  THESEUS.
 Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,  
    To wear away this long age of three hours
    Between our after-supper and bed-time?
    Where is our usual manager of mirth?
    What revels are in hand? Is there no play
    To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
    Call Philostrate.

  PHILOSTRATE.

                                                [Giving a paper]
  THESEUS.
'
    We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
    In glory of my kinsman Hercules.

    'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
    Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.
'
    That is some satire, keen and critical,
    Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
 Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
    Which never labour'd in their minds till now;
    And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
    With this same play against your nuptial.

  THESEUS.

  THESEUS.

    Go, bring them in; and take your places, ladies.
 Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
 He says they can do nothing in this kind.

    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome.


                       Re-enter PHILOSTRATE  

  PHILOSTRATE.
              [Flourish of trumpets]

                 Enter QUINCE as the PROLOGUE

  PROLOGUE.
 That you should here repent you,
    The actors are at band; and, by their show,
    You shall know all, that you are like to know,
  THESEUS.
 His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,
    but all disordered.
 In this same interlude it doth befall
    That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
    And such a wall as I would have you think  
    That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
    Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
    Did whisper often very secretly.

  THESEUS.


                       Enter PYRAMUS

  THESEUS.
 No, in truth, sir, he should not.
 She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.

  THISBY.

  PYRAMUS.

  THISBY.
 Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
  THISBY.
 Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
    And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
 No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
    without warning.

  HIPPOLYTA.

  THESEUS.

  DEMETRIUS.
 True; and a goose for his discretion.

  MOONSHINE.
 I am aweary of this moon.

  MOON.

  THESEUS.
 Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

  LYSANDER.

  THESEUS.
 Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
    Pyramus; I hope she will be brief.
 A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
    Thisby, is the better- he for a man, God warrant us: She for a
    woman, God bless us!
  LYSANDER.
 [Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that
    parted their fathers.
 But
    come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.

    This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
    The heavy gait of night.

             Now the wasted brands do glow,
             Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
             Puts the wretch that lies in woe
             In remembrance of a shroud.

             Now it is the time of night
             That the graves, all gaping wide,
             Every one lets forth his sprite,
             In the church-way paths to glide.
      First, rehearse your song by rote,
                To each word a warbling note;
                Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
                Will we sing, and bless this place.
    Now, until the break of day,
             Through this house each fairy stray.
    Exeunt all but PUCK
  PUCK.
      If we shadows have offended,
             Think but this, and all is mended,
             That you have but slumb'red here
             While these visions did appear.

  Leon.

  Mess.
 A kind overflow of kindness.
 I know none of that name, lady.
 O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.
 I pray
    you, how many hath he kill'd and eaten in these wars? But how
    many hath he kill'd? For indeed I promised to eat all of his
    killing.

  Mess.

  Beat.
 A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable
    virtues.

  Beat.
 You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

  Beat.
 O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner
    caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad.
 Do, good friend.
 Don Pedro is approach'd.

  Leon.

  Bene.

  Bene.
 A dear happiness to women! They would else have been troubled
    with a pernicious suitor.

  Bene.

  Bene.

  Leon.
 No.
 Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,
    too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.
 But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have
    you?
  Claud.
 Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but
    he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a
    bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i' faith! An thou wilt needs  
    thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
    Sundays.

  Pedro.
 With who? Now that is your Grace's
    part.
 By my troth, I speak my thought.

  Bene.

  Pedro.

  Claud.
 And never could maintain his part but in the force of his
    will.
 With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with
    love.

  Pedro.
 From my house--if I had it--
  Pedro.
 Your loving friend, Benedick.

  Bene.
 The body of your discourse is
    sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly
    basted on neither.
 My liege, your Highness now may do me good.
 My love is thine to teach.

  Claud.
 Wast not to this end
    That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
  Claud.

    I will assume thy part in some disguise
    And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
    And take her hearing prisoner with the force
    And strong encounter of my amorous tale.

  Leon.
 We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but  
    I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better
    prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true.
 What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure
    sad?
  John.
 I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born
    under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
    mortifying mischief.
 I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when
    I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have
    stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy,
    and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no
    man in his humour.
 You have of late stood out against
    your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where  
    it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
    weather that you make yourself.
 I came yonder from a great supper.
 A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
  Bora.
 I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed
    upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
    obtain'd her, give her to Count Claudio.
 This may prove food to my
    displeasure.
 Let us to the great supper.

  Beat.

  Hero.
 He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
    between him and Benedick.
 Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth,
    and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face--
  Beat.

  Leon.
 In faith, she's too curst.

  Beat.
 I shall lessen God's sending
    that way, for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns,'
    but to a cow too curst he sends none.
 You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
 Therefore I will even take sixpence in
    earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell.
 Well then, go you into hell?
  Beat.
' So  
    deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter--for the heavens.
 [to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
    father.

  Beat.
'
  Leon.

  Beat.

  Beat.
 With me in your company?  
  Hero.
 I may say so when I please.
 When I like your favour, for God defend the lute should be
    like the case!
  Pedro.

  Hero.
 Speak low if you speak love.
         [Takes her aside.
 So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill
    qualities.
 I love you the better.
 God match me with a good dancer!
  Balth.
 Amen.
 I know you by the waggling of your head.

  Ant.
 Here's his dry hand up and down.

  Urs.

  Beat.

  Beat.
 Nor will you not tell me who you are?
  Bene.

  Beat.
 I pray you, what is he?
  Beat.

    I would he had boarded me.
]
    We must follow the leaders.
 Exeunt (all but Don John, Borachio, and Claudio].

  John.
 Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her
    father to break with him about it.
 The ladies follow her and but  
    one visor remains.
 And that is Claudio.
 I know him by his bearing.
 I am he.

  John.
 So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
 Thus answer I in name of Benedick
    But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
 Yea, the same.
 Come, will you go with me?
  Claud.
 Even to the next willow, about your own business, County.
 Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier.
 But did you think the Prince would have served you
    thus?
  Claud.
 Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong.
 It is the base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice
    that puts the world into her person and so gives me out.

  Pedro.
 I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.


           Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero.

  Bene.
]
  Pedro.

  Beat.

  Beat.
 I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent
    me to seek.
 Neither, my lord.

  Pedro.
 Here, Claudio, I
    have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won.
 Name the day of marriage,
    and God give thee joy!
  Leon.
 Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes.
 Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss
    and let not him speak neither.
 Hath your
    Grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excellent
    husbands, if a maid could come by them.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.
 Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing;
    but I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us.

    I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which
    is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a
    mountain of affection th' one with th' other.

  Leon.
 My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights'
    watchings.
 And I, my lord.
 I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a
    good husband.
 I will teach you how to humour
    your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I,
    [to Leonato and Claudio] with your two helps, will so practise on
    Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
    stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.


Enter [Don] John and Borachio.
 The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
    Leonato.

  John.
 Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty
    shall appear in me.
 Show me briefly how.
 The poison of that lies in you to temper.
 Only to despite them I will endeavour anything.

  Bora.
 Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
    Claudio alone; tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend
    a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as--in love of
    your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
    reputation, who is thus like to be cozen'd with the semblance of
    a maid--that you have discover'd thus.
 Offer them instances; which shall bear no
    less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me
    call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them
    to see this the very night before the intended wedding (for in
    the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
    absent) and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's  
    disloyalty that jealousy shall be call'd assurance and all the
    preparation overthrown.
 Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in
    practice.





Scene III.
 In my chamber window lies a book.
 Bring it hither to me in
    the orchard.
 He was wont to speak plain
    and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is
    he turn'd orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet--
    just so many strange dishes.
 One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
    well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in
    one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.


        Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more!
          Men were deceivers ever,
        One foot in sea, and one on shore;
          To one thing constant never.


        Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
          Of dumps so dull and heavy!
        The fraud of men was ever so,
          Since summer first was leavy.

            Then sigh not so, &c.
 No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote
    on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours
    seem'd ever to abhor.
 It is past the
    infinite of thought.

  Pedro.

  Claud.

  Leon.
  
  Claud.
 [aside] I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded
    fellow speaks it.
 [aside] He hath ta'en th' infection.
 That's her torment.
 This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for
    she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her
    smock till she have writ a sheet of paper.
 Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest
    your daughter told us of.
 O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, rail'd at
    herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
    knew would flout her.
'
  Claud.
 O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,
    we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.
 I would have
    daff'd all other respects and made her half myself.
 Were it good, think you?
  Claud.
 She doth well.

  Pedro.
  
  Claud.
 And I take him to be valiant.
 Let her wear it out with good
    counsel.
 I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
    modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
    lady.
 If he dote on her upon this, I will never trust my
    expectation.

    That's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb
    show.


                [Benedick advances from the arbour.
 This can be no trick.

    It seems her affections have their full bent.
 Happy are they that
    hear their detractions and can put them to mending.


                 Enter Beatrice.

  Bene.

  Beat.
 You take pleasure then in the message?  
  Beat.
 Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knives point, and
    choke a daw withal.
 Fare you well.
 I will go get her picture.

 Scene I.


Enter Hero and two Gentlewomen, Margaret and Ursula.


  Hero.
 This is thy office.

    Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
]
  Hero.
 Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
    Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
 And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
  Hero.
 Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
    Deserve as full, as fortunate a bed
    As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
  Hero.
 She cannot love,
    Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
    She is so self-endeared.

  Urs.
 One doth not know
    How much an ill word may empoison liking.

  Urs.
 He is the only man of Italy,
    Always excepted my dear Claudio.
 I pray you be not angry with me, madam,
    Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
    For shape, for bearing, argument, and valour,
    Goes foremost in report through Italy.
 Indeed he hath an excellent good name.

    When are you married, madam?
  Hero.
 She's lim'd, I warrant you! We have caught her, madam.
  
                                       Exeunt [Hero and Ursula].


    [Beatrice advances from the arbour.

    If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
    To bind our loves up in a holy band;
    For others say thou dost deserve, and I
    Believe it better than reportingly.
 I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go
    I toward Arragon.

  Leon.
 If he be sad, he wants money.

  Bene.
 I have the toothache.
 Draw it.
 What? sigh for the toothache?
  Leon.

  Claud.
 'A brushes his hat o' mornings.
 That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
 Nay, but I know who loves him.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.

                                  [Exeunt Benedick and Leonato.
 For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!
  Claud.

  Pedro.
 I know not that, when he knows what I know.
 You may think I love you not.
 For my brother, I  
    think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to
    effect your ensuing marriage--surely suit ill spent and labour
    ill bestowed!
  Pedro.
 Even she--Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero.
 Disloyal?
  John.
 Wonder not till further warrant.


Enter Dogberry and his compartner [Verges], with the Watch.
 Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
 Watch.

  2.
 Well, for your
    favour, sir, why, give God thanks and make no boast of it; and
    for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no
    need of such vanity.
 If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the
    Prince's subjects.

  Dog.
 Well, sir.
 Watch.

  Verg.
 You have been always called a merciful man, partner.

  2.
 If you meet the Prince in the night,
    you may stay him.

  Verg.
 By'r lady, I think it be so.
 I pray you watch about
    Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,  
    there is a great coil to-night.


                     Enter Borachio and Conrade.
 Here, man.

  Bora.

  Con.

  Bora.
 'A bas been a vile thief
    this seven year; 'a goes up and down like a gentleman.

  Bora.
 All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears out more
    apparel than the man.
 Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my
    master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which
    first possess'd them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive
    them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander
    that Don John had made, away went Claudio enrag'd; swore he would
    meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and
    there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw  
    o'ernight and send her home again without a husband.
 Watch.
 We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of
    these men's bills.

  Con.





Scene IV.


  Hero.

  Urs.

  Urs.
 Well.

  Hero.
 By my troth, 's but a nightgown in respect of yours--
    cloth-o'-gold and cuts, and lac'd with silver, set with pearls
    down sleeves, side-sleeves, and skirts, round underborne with  
    a blush tinsel.
 Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
  Marg.
 Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not marriage
    honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord honourable without
    marriage? I think you would have me say, 'saving your reverence,
    a husband.
 Ask my Lady Beatrice else.

    Here she comes.


                               Enter Beatrice.


  Hero.
 Clap's into 'Light o' love.
 Do
    you sing it, and I'll dance it.
 Yea, 'Light o' love' with your heels! then, if your husband
    have stables enough, you'll see he shall lack no barnes.

  Beat.

  Marg.
 There thou prick'st her with a thistle.
 Benedictus? why benedictus? You have some moral in this
    'benedictus.
 What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
  Marg.
 Not a false gallop.

  
                         Enter Ursula.


  Urs.
 Madam, withdraw.


  Leon.

  Leon.
 Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter--an old
    man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would
    desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his
    brows.
 Comparisons are odorous.
 And so am I.
 Well, God's a good
    man.
 Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.

  Dog.

  Dog.
 We are now to examination these
    men.
 And we must do it wisely.

 Scene I.

A church.


Enter Don Pedro, [John the] Bastard, Leonato, Friar [Francis], Claudio,
Benedick, Hero, Beatrice, [and Attendants].


  Leon.
 Come, Friar Francis, be brief.

  Leon.

  Friar.
 Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
  Hero.

  Friar.

  Claud.
 Nothing, unless you render her again.

    There, Leonato, take her back again.
 Not to be married,
    Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
 I know what you would say.

    You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
    As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
    But you are more intemperate in your blood  
    Than Venus, or those pamp'red animals
    That rage in savage sensuality.
 Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
  Pedro.
 Leonato, stand I here?
    Is this the Prince, Is this the Prince's brother?
    Is this face Hero's? Are our eyes our own?
  Leon.
 Let me but move one question to your daughter,
    And by that fatherly and kindly power
    That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

  Hero.

  Hero.

    What man was he talk'd with you yesternight,
    Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
    Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

  John.
 Fie, fie! they are not to be nam'd, my lord--
    Not to be spoke of;  
    There is not chastity, enough in language
    Without offence to utter them.
 Thus, pretty lady,
    I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

  Claud.

  Leon.
]
  Beat.
 Help, uncle!  
    Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
  Leon.

    For my part, I am so attir'd in wonder,
    I know not what to say.
 O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
  Bene.
 Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made  
    Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
    Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie,
    Who lov'd her so that, speaking of her foulness,
    Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
  
  Leon.

    Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
    That which appears in proper nakedness?
  Friar.
  
  Leon.
 What shall become of this? What will this do?
  Friar.
 Being that I flow in grief,
    The smallest twine may lead me.
 This wedding day
    Perhaps is but prolong'd.

  Beat.
 Is not that  
    strange?
  Beat.
 By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
 I protest I love
    thee.

  Beat.

  Beat.
 Ha! not for the wide world!
  Beat.
 There is no love in you.
 Is 'a not approved in the height a villain, that hath
    slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O that I were a
    man! What? bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and
    then with public accusation, uncover'd slander, unmitigated
    rancour--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the
    market place.

  Bene.

  Bene.
 Beat--
  Beat.
 Princes and Counties! Surely a princely testimony, a goodly
    count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant surely! O that I were a man
    for his sake! or that I had any friend would be a man for my
    sake! But manhood is melted into cursies, valour into compliment,
    and men are only turn'd into tongue, and trim ones too.
 Tarry, good Beatrice.
 By this hand, I love thee.
 Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
 I must say she is dead-and so farewell.

  Sex.
 But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them
    come before Master Constable.
 What is your name,
    friend?
  Bor.
 Borachio.
 Yours, sirrah?
  Con.
 Marry, sir, we say we are none.
 A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go about
    with him.
 Master Constable, you go not the way to examine.
 Yea, marry, that's the eftest way.

    Masters, I charge you in the Prince's name accuse these men.
 This man said, sir, that Don John the Prince's brother
    was a villain.
 Write down Prince John a villain.
 I do not like thy look, I promise
    thee.

  Sex.
 What else, fellow?
  1.
 This is all.
 Master Constable, let these men be bound and
    brought to Leonato's.
                                         [Exit.

  Dog.
--Thou naughty varlet!
  Con.
 Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my
    years? O that he were here to write me down an ass! But, masters,
    remember that I am an ass.
 If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,
    And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
    Against yourself.
 Give not me counsel,
    Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
    But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.

    If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
    Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan,  
    Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
    With candle-wasters--bring him yet to me,
    And I of him will gather patience.

    My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
 Therein do men from children nothing differ.
 I will be flesh and blood;
    For there was never yet philosopher
    That could endure the toothache patiently,  
    However they have writ the style of gods
    And made a push at chance and sufferance.
 Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.


  Ant.
 We have some haste, Leonato.

    Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.
 If he could right himself with quarrelling,  
    Some of us would lie low.
 Mary, beshrew my hand
    If it should give your age such cause of fear.
 You say not right, old man
  Leon.

    And.
 He shall kill two of us, and men indeed
    But that's no matter; let him kill one first.

    Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
  Leon.
 Brother Anthony--
  Ant.
 Come, 'tis no matter.
 I will not hear you.
 No? Come, brother, away!--I will be heard.

  Ant.

                                                    Exeunt ambo.
 We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof
    melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away.
 Wilt thou use thy  
    wit?
  Bene.
 It is in my scabbard.
 Never any did so, though very many have been beside their
    wit.
 I pray you choose another subject.
 God bless me from a challenge!
  Bene.
 Do  
    me right, or I will protest your cowardice.

  Pedro.
' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.
' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the
    tongues.
' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me
    on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning.
' Thus did she an hour
    together transshape thy particular virtues.
  
  Claud.

  Pedro.
 But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the
    sensible Benedick's head?
  Claud.
 I will leave you now to
    your gossiplike humour.
 You break jests as braggards do their
    blades, which God be thanked hurt not.
 My lord, for your many
    courtesies I thank you.

  Claud.
 And hath challeng'd thee.
 What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and
    hose and leaves off his wit!

  Enter Constables [Dogberry and Verges, with the Watch, leading]
                      Conrade and Borachio.
 How now? two of my brother's men bound? Borachio one.
 Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.

  Claud.

  Verg.
 Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
    Mine innocent child?
  Bora.

  Leon.
 Yet sinn'd I not
    But in mistaking.

  Pedro.
 By my soul, nor I!
    And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
    I would bend under any heavy weight  
    That he'll enjoin me to.

  Leon.

  Bora.

  Dog.
 We will not fall.
 To-night I'll mourn with Hero.


  Bene.

  Marg.
 And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit but hurt
    not.
 If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a
    vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

       [Sings] The god of love,
               That sits above
           And knows me, and knows me,
             How pitiful I deserve--

    I mean in singing; but in loving Leander the good swimmer,
    Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole book full of
    these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the
    even road of a blank verse--why, they were never so truly turn'd
    over and over as my poor self in love.
 And yet, ere I go, let
    me go with that I came for, which is, with knowing what hath
    pass'd between you and Claudio.

  Bene.
 Therefore I will depart
    unkiss'd.
 I do suffer love indeed, for I
    love thee against my will.
  
  Beat.
 Alas, poor heart! If you
    spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I will never
    love that which my friend hates.
 Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
 It appears not in this confession.
 There's not one wise man
    among twenty, that will praise himself.
 An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that liv'd in the time of
    good neighbours.
 Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum.

  Bene.
 And how do you?
  Beat.
 Serve God, love me, and mend.


  Urs.
 Will you come presently?
  Beat.





Scene III.

  Claud.
 Now unto thy bones good night!
    Yearly will I do this rite.

  Pedro.
 Good morrow, masters.
 Put your torches out.
 Good morrow, masters.
 And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds
    Than this for whom we rend'red up this woe.

    But Margaret was in some fault for this,
    Although against her will, as it appears
    In the true course of all the question.
 Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
 And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
    To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

                                                  Exeunt Ladies.
 You know your office, brother:
    You must be father to your brother's daughter,  
    And give her to young Claudio.
 'Tis most true.
 Here comes other reckonings.

    Which is the lady I must seize upon?
  Ant.
 This same is she, and I do give you her.
 Why then, she's mine.
 No, that you shall not till you take her hand
    Before this friar and swear to marry her.
 Give me your hand before this holy friar.
 Nothing certainer.
 All this amazement can I qualify,
    When, after that the holy rites are ended,
    I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.

  Bene.

  Bene.

  Bene.
 Then you do not love me?
  Beat.
  
  Leon.
 And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
    For here's a paper written in his hand,
    A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
    Fashion'd to Beatrice.
 A miracle! Here's our own hands against our hearts.

  Beat.
 I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon
    great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told
    you were in a consumption.
             [Kisses her.

  Claud.
 Come, come, we are friends.

  Leon.
 Prince, thou art
    sad.

Enter Roderigo and Iago.
 Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

  RODERIGO.
 Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
 Despise me, if I do not.
 Three great ones of the city,
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
    Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.

  RODERIGO.
 Why, there's no remedy.
 Now, sir, be judge yourself
    Whether I in any just term am affined
    To love the Moor.

  RODERIGO.

    I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd.
 What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
  IAGO.


  BRABANTIO.
                   Why? Wherefore ask you this?
  IAGO.
 Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
  BRABANTIO.
 Because we come to do you service and you
    think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a
    Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
    coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.
 Thou are a villain.
 Sir, I will answer anything.
 Straight satisfy yourself:
    If she be in her chamber or your house,
    Let loose on me the justice of the state
    For thus deluding you.

  BRABANTIO.
                  Exit.

  BRABANTIO.
 Call up my brother.
 O, would you had had her!
    Some one way, some another.
  
  BRABANTIO.
 At every house I'll call;
    I may command at most.

    On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve your pains.

Another street.
 'Tis better as it is.

    My services, which I have done the signiory,
    Shall out-tongue his complaints.

    You were best go in.

  OTHELLO.
             The Duke does greet you, general,
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
    Even on the instant.
 Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
    It is a business of some heat.
 The galleys
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
    This very night at one another's heels;
    And many of the consuls, raised and met,
    Are at the Duke's already.

  CASSIO.
 Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;
    If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.

  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.
                                    To who?

                          Re-enter Othello.
 Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?
  OTHELLO.

  IAGO.
 General, be advised,
    He comes to bad intent.


         Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers with torches
                             and weapons.
 You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.

  OTHELLO.
        'Tis true, most worthy signior;
    The Duke's in council, and your noble self,
    I am sure, is sent for.


  DUKE.
 There is no composition in these news
    That gives them credit.

  DUKE.
                      And mine, two hundred.

    But though they jump not on a just account-
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,
    'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

  DUKE.

    I do not so secure me in the error,
    But the main article I do approve
    In fearful sense.
 A messenger from the galleys.

  DUKE.
 Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  
  FIRST OFFICER.


                          Enter a Messenger.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem
    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
    Their purposes toward Cyprus.
 'Tis certain then for Cyprus.

    Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
  FIRST SENATOR.

  
       Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.
 Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.
              Humbly I thank your Grace.
                   We are very sorry for't.

  DUKE.
 Nothing, but this is so.
 Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her;
    The very head and front of my offending  
    Hath this extent, no more.
 Rude am I in my speech,
    And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself.
                  To vouch this is no proof,
    Without more certain and more overt test
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.

    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.


                Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants.
 I think this tale would win my daughter too.

    Good Brabantio,  
    Take up this mangled matter at the best:
    Men do their broken weapons rather use
    Than their bare hands.

  BRABANTIO.

    If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress.

    Do you perceive in all this noble company
    Where most you owe obedience?
  DESDEMONA.

    To you I am bound for life and education;
    My life and education both do learn me
    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,
    I am hitherto your daughter.
 I have done, my lord.

    To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
  
  BRABANTIO.

    He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.

    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
 You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss
    of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
    expedition.

  OTHELLO.
 Nor I.
 Most gracious Duke,
    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,
    And let me find a charter in your voice
    To assist my simpleness.
                        This night.
 At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.

  OTHELLO.
                  Let it be so.
 [To Brabantio.
] And, noble signior,
    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
 Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.
 Iago!  
  IAGO.
 What say'st thou, noble heart?
  RODERIGO.
 What will I do, thinkest thou?
  IAGO.
 Why, go to bed and sleep.

  IAGO.

    Why, thou silly gentleman!
  RODERIGO.
 O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
    seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
    an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself.

  RODERIGO.

    Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so
    that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed
    up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
    many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with  
    industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
    our wills.
 It cannot be that Desdemona should long
    continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his
    to her.
 These Moors
    are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money.
 Make all the money thou canst.

  RODERIGO.
 I have told thee often,
    and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
 If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself
    a pleasure, me a sport.
 There are many events in the womb of time
    which will be delivered.
 Go to, farewell.
 What say you?
  IAGO.
 No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO.
 He holds me well,
    The better shall my purpose work on him.
 It is engender'd.

Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.
 It is a high-wrought flood;
    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
    Descry a sail.
                 If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
    It is impossible to bear it out.

  MONTANO.
 Michael Cassio,
    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello,
    Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
 I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
 But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly  
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
    With foul and violent tempest.
                         Pray heavens he be,
    For I have served him, and the man commands
    Like a full soldier.


                            Enter Cassio.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 I shall.
 Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid  
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.


                           How now! who has put in?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

    Hall to thee, lady! And the grace of heaven,
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee round!
  DESDEMONA.
 The great contention of the sea and skies
    Parted our fellowship- But, hark! a sail.

  CASSIO.
             Kisses her.

  IAGO.

    Marry, before your ladyship I grant,
    She puts her tongue a little in her heart
    And chides with thinking.
 Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
    You rise to play, and go to bed to work.
 O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best.
 To do what?
  IAGO.
 You say true; 'tis so, indeed.
 Yet again your fingers to your lips?
    Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! [Trumpet within.

  CASSIO.


  OTHELLO.
] O, you are well tuned now!
    But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
    As honest as I am.
 I prithee, good Iago,
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.

  IAGO.
 Come hither.

  RODERIGO.

  IAGO.
 Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
 Now, for want of these
    required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
    abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor;
    very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
    choice.
 Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and
    unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this
    fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further
    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
    seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
    affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a
    finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
    counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present
    itself- a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
    and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds  
    look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found
    him already.
 Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes.
 Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

    Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me.
 Do you find some
    occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
    tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please,
    which the time shall more favorably minister.

  RODERIGO.
 Adieu.
 Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
    (For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),
    Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
    For making him egregiously an ass
    And practicing upon his peace and quiet
    Even to madness.
               Exit.
 It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
    that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere
    perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into
    triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what
    sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these
    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial.





SCENE III.
 Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.

    Michael, good night.
 She's a most exquisite lady.
 And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
 Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

  CASSIO.
 Not tonight, good Iago.

  CASSIO.
 I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily  
    qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.
 Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.


  CASSIO.

  MONTANO.
]   "And let me the canakin clink, clink;
               And let me the canakin clink.
"

    Some wine, boys!
  CASSIO.
 Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander-
    Drink, ho!- are nothing to your English.
 To the health of our general!
  MONTANO.
 O sweet England!

    [Sings.
 Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO.

  IAGO.
 Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
    be saved before the ancient.
 Excellent well.

  CASSIO.
  
  MONTANO.
 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.

  MONTANO.

    It were an honest action to say
    So to the Moor.

    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"

                Re-enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.


  CASSIO.
 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
  MONTANO.
 Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.

  MONTANO.
 Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
 Come, come, you're drunk.

    Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!
    Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-
    Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!
                                                        A bell rings.


                   Re-enter Othello and Attendants.
                      What is the matter here?
  MONTANO.
 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

   Faints.
 How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  CASSIO.
 I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
 What's the matter,
    That you unlace your reputation thus,
    And spend your rich opinion for the name
    Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.
  
  OTHELLO.
 Give me to know
    How this foul rout began, who set it on,
    And he that is approved in this offense,
    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me.
 What! in a town of war,
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
    To manage private and domestic quarrel,
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
    'Tis monstrous.

  OTHELLO.
                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio.

  DESDEMONA.

    Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.

    Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.

                                      Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio.
 What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
  CASSIO.

  IAGO.
 As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily
    wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.
 What, man! there are
    ways to recover the general again.
 You are but now cast in his
    mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one
    would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion.

  CASSIO.
 I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
    commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an
    officer.
 O God, that men should put an
    enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should,
    with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves
    into beasts!
  IAGO.
 As the time, the place,
    and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish
    this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your  
    own good.
 I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a
    drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would
    stop them all.

  CASSIO.
 You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man.
 Our general's wife is now the
    general.
 Good night, lieutenant, I must to the
    watch.

  IAGO.
 She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements.
 How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.

    Away, I say.
                      Exit.
 SCENE I.


  CASSIO.
 Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that
    they speak i' the nose thus?
  FIRST MUSICIAN.
 How, sir, how?
  CLOWN.
 Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
  FIRST MUSICIAN.
 Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
  CLOWN.
 But,
    masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your
    music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more
    noise with it.
 We have none such, sir.
 Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
 If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be
    stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor
    of speech.
 She is stirring, sir.

  CASSIO.
 I humbly thank you for't.


                            Enter Emilia.
 I am sorry
    For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.

  CASSIO.

    I will bestow you where you shall have time
    To speak your bosom freely.





SCENE II.
                 Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

  OTHELLO.


  DESDEMONA.
 I warrant it grieves my husband
    As if the cause were his.
                    Bounteous madam,
    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
    He's never anything but your true servant.
 I know't: I thank you.
 You do love my lord:
    You have known him long; and be you well assured
    He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
    Than in a politic distance.

  DESDEMONA.
 Well, do your discretion.
 Tomorrow dinner then?
  OTHELLO.
 When shall he come?
    Tell me, Othello.
 What? Michael Cassio,
    That came awooing with you, and so many a time
    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
    Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do
    To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much-
  OTHELLO.
                  Why, this is not a boon;
    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
    To your own person.
 Nay, when I have a suit
    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
    And fearful to be granted.

  OTHELLO.
 Be as your fancies teach you;
    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

  OTHELLO.
 Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
    Know of your love?
  OTHELLO.
           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
 O, yes, and went between us very oft.
 Indeed!  
  OTHELLO.
 Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO.
 My lord, for aught I know.
 Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO.
 If thou dost love me,
    Show me thy thought.

  IAGO.
 My lord, you know I love you.
                       For Michael Cassio,
    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

  OTHELLO.
 Certain, men should be what they seem.
                 Good my lord, pardon me;
    Though I am bound to every act of duty,  
    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
 Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
    A stranger to thy thoughts.

  OTHELLO.
 No, Iago,
    I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;  
    And on the proof, there is no more but this-
    Away at once with love or jealousy!
  IAGO.

    Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
    Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.
 Look to't.

  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
 [Going.
 Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
    Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
  
  IAGO.
 I once more take my leave.
 This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings.

  OTHELLO.
 I have a pain upon my forehead here.

  DESDEMONA.

    Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
    It will be well.

    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her  
    To kiss and talk to.
 I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago.
 What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
 O, is that all? What will you give me now
    For that same handkerchief?
  IAGO.
 No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,  
    And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.
 Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
 I did say so.

  OTHELLO.
 I had been happy if the general camp,
    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
    So I had nothing known.
 Give me the ocular proof;
    Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,
    Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
    Than answer my waked wrath!  
  IAGO.
 Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  
  IAGO.
             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO.
 But yet, I say,
    If imputation and strong circumstances,
    Which lead directly to the door of truth,
    Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

    There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
    That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
    One of this kind is Cassio.
                            Nay, this was but his dream.

  OTHELLO.

  IAGO.

    'Tis gone.
                             They rise.
                     I greet thy love,
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
    And will upon the instant put thee to't:
    Within these three days let me hear thee say  
    That Cassio's not alive.
 Why, man?
  CLOWN.
 Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN.
 I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
    and by them answer.
                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA.


                            Enter Othello.
 This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
    Hot, hot, and moist.
 This hand of yours requires
    A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
    Much castigation, exercise devout,
    For here's a young and sweating devil here
    That commonly rebels.

  OTHELLO.
 I cannot speak of this.
 I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  
  OTHELLO.
 No, faith, my lord.
 I did so, and take heed on't;
    Make it a darling like your precious eye;
    To lose't or give't away were such perdition
    As nothing else could match.
 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO.
 Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA.
 Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA.
 I say, it is not lost.

  OTHELLO.

  DESDEMONA.
 Come, come,
    You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
                 A man that all his time
    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
    Shared dangers with you-
  OTHELLO.
 In sooth, you are to blame.
 Look you! Cassio and my husband.
  
  DESDEMONA.

    So help me every spirit sanctified,
    As I have spoken for you all my best
    And stood within the blank of his displeasure
    For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.
  
                               Something sure of state,
    Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice
    Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
    Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases
    Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
    Though great ones are their object.
 'Tis even so;
    For let our finger ache, and it indues
    Our other healthful members even to that sense
    Of pain.
 Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
    And no conception nor no jealous toy
    Concerning you.
 Cassio, walk hereabout.
 I humbly thank your ladyship.


  BIANCA.
                          What make you from home?
    How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
    I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
              Pardon me, Bianca.

  CASSIO.
 I do attend here on the general;
    And think it no addition, nor my wish,
    To have him see me woman'd.

    I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
    And say if I shall see you soon at night.
            Exeunt.

Cyprus.
 Before the castle.
 Will you think so?
  OTHELLO.
                 Think so, Iago?
  IAGO.
 So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
 Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
    They have it very oft that have it not.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
 With her?
  IAGO.
              With her, on her, what you will.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.

    O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
    To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
    And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

  OTHELLO.
                                    Stand you awhile apart,
    Confine yourself but in a patient list.

  IAGO.

    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes.
 Here he comes.
 How do you now, lieutenant?
  CASSIO.
 Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO.
 Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO.
 So, so, so, so.

  OTHELLO.
 Have you scored me? Well.

  OTHELLO.


    What do you mean by this haunting of me?
  BIANCA.
 Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
    that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to
    take it.
 How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO.
 By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA.
 After her, after her.
 Will you sup there?
  CASSIO.
 Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
    with you.
 Go to; say no more.

  OTHELLO.
 [Advancing.
 Yours, by this hand.
 Nay, you must forget that.

    She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.
 Nay, that's not your way.
 If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
    offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
 Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
    she hath contaminated.
 And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.

  OTHELLO.


  LODOVICO.

  OTHELLO.
 I am very glad to see you, signior;
    Welcome to Cyprus.
 Lives, sir.

    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
  DESDEMONA.

  OTHELLO.
 Fire and brimstone!
  DESDEMONA.
                                Indeed!
  DESDEMONA.
 I am glad to see you mad.

  DESDEMONA.
 I have not deserved this.

  OTHELLO.
                      O devil, devil!
    If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
                              Who, I, my lord?
  OTHELLO.
 Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.

    Concerning this, sir- O well-painted passion!-
    I am commanded home.
 Get you away;
    I'll send for you anon.
 And, sir, tonight,
    I do entreat that we may sup together.

    You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
 Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
    Call all in all sufficient? This the nature
    Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
    The shot of accident nor dart of chance
    Could neither graze nor pierce?
  IAGO.
                            Is it his use?
    Or did the letters work upon his blood,
    And new create this fault?
  IAGO.
             Exeunt.





SCENE II.
 You have seen nothing, then?
  EMILIA.
                                Never, my lord.
 Nor send you out o' the way?
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO.
         Exit Emilia.

    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much.
 This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.


                     Enter Desdemona with Emilia.
 What is your pleasure?
  OTHELLO.
         What horrible fancy's this?
  OTHELLO.
 Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
    I understand a fury in your words,
    But not the words.
               Heaven doth truly know it.
 Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO.
                  No, as I shall be saved.
 Is't possible?
  DESDEMONA.
 O, heaven forgive us!
  OTHELLO.
 With who?
  EMILIA.

  DESDEMONA.
 Prithee, tonight
    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.

  EMILIA.

  DESDEMONA.
 Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
    Her father and her country and her friends,
    To be call'd whore? Would it not make one weep?
  DESDEMONA.
                                 Beshrew him for't!
    How comes this trick upon him?  
  DESDEMONA.
 If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA.
  
  IAGO.
 I will indeed
    no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace
    what already I have foolishly suffered.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.
 You charge me most unjustly.
 I have wasted myself out of my
    means.
 Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
    doing.
 It hath not appeared.

  IAGO.
 Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO.
 Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
    to Venice.
 Come, stand not
    amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a
    necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
    it on him.





SCENE III.


Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.
 Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

  DESDEMONA.
 Your honor is most welcome.
 Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
    forthwith.

  DESDEMONA.

  DESDEMONA.
 That song tonight
    Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
    But to go hang my head all at one side
    And sing it like poor Barbary.
 Shall I go fetch your nightgown?  
  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA.
 A very handsome man.
 I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
    Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
]   "Sing willow, willow, willow-"
  
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon-
    [Sings.

  DESDEMONA.

        If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men-"

    So get thee gone; good night.
 Mine eyes do itch;
    Doth that bode weeping?
  EMILIA.
 I have heard it said so.

  DESDEMONA.

    Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for
    measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any
    petty exhibition; but, for the whole world- why, who would not
    make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should
    venture purgatory for't.

  EMILIA.
 Is't frailty that thus errs?
    It is so too.

ACT V.

Cyprus.
 Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.

    Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.

    It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
    And fix most firm thy resolution.
 Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

  Retires.

  RODERIGO.


                            Enter Cassio.


  RODERIGO.
           Draws, and wounds Roderigo.
 I am maim'd forever.
  

  OTHELLO.
 O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO.

  CASSIO.
 O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me.
 Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies.

     Exit.


                     Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.
 O wretched villain!  
  LODOVICO.
                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO.
                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO.
 What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO.
 Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
    Give me some help.
 He, sir.
 Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
 Cassio?
  IAGO.
 What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO.
 Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA.
 O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
    Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
  CASSIO.
 Lend me a garter.
 So.
 Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
    These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
    That so neglected you.
                I am glad to see you.
] O, that's well said:
      the chair.
 [To Bianca.
] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.


  EMILIA.
 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO.
 O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

    Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
 Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.


  OTHELLO.

    Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
    It is the cause.
 Yet I'll not shed her blood,
    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
    And smooth as monumental alabaster.

    Put out the light, and then put out the light.
 Who's there? Othello?
  OTHELLO.

  DESDEMONA.
 Will you come to bed, my lord?
  OTHELLO.
 Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
  OTHELLO.
 And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
    When your eyes roll so.
                         Sweet soul, take heed,
    Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.
 Thou art to die.

  OTHELLO.
 By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.

  OTHELLO.
 What, my lord?
  OTHELLO.
 He will not say so.
                       No, his mouth is stopp'd;
    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

  DESDEMONA.
                     Being done, there is no pause.

    So, so.
 [Within.
 By and by.

    'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.

    My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife.

    O, insupportable! O heavy hour!
    Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse  
    Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
    Should yawn at alteration.
 O, come in, Emilia.


                    What's the matter with thee now?
  EMILIA.
           Roderigo kill'd?  
    And Cassio kill'd?
  EMILIA.
              No, Cassio is not kill'd.

  DESDEMONA.
 Farewell;
    Commend me to my kind lord.
 Why, how should she be murther'd?
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO.
                    O, the more angel she,
    And you the blacker devil!
  OTHELLO.

  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO.

  EMILIA.

  EMILIA.
 Ay, with Cassio.

  EMILIA.
 Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
                        My husband?
  OTHELLO.
 O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
    My husband say that she was false!
  OTHELLO.
 Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt.
 Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!

              Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.


  MONTANO.
 What is the matter?
  EMILIA.

  EMILIA.
 I did.
 I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
 I'll kill myself for grief.
           Nay, lay thee down and roar;
    For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent  
    That e'er did lift up eye.
            [Rises.
 O heaven! O heavenly powers!  
  IAGO.
 'Zounds! Hold your peace.
 I peace?
    No, I will speak as liberal as the north;
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

                                          Iago offers to stab Emilia.
 By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
          Exit Iago.

  OTHELLO.
                   I am not valiant neither,
    But every puny whipster gets my sword.

    But why should honor outlive honesty?
    Let it go all.

  EMILIA.


                          Re-enter Gratiano.


  GRATIANO.
                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh.
 I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments  
    Than twenty times your stop.

    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
 Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.

    If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.

  LODOVICO.

  IAGO.
                      Why, anything;
    An honorable murtherer, if you will,
    For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.

  OTHELLO.
 Here is a letter
    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
    And here another.

  OTHELLO.

  LODOVICO.

                                          Falls on the bed, and dies.
         [To Iago.
 The object poisons sight;
    Let it be hid.

London.

  KING RICHARD.

    Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
  BOLINGBROKE.
  
    First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
    Which else would post until it had return'd
    These terms of treason doubled down his throat.

    Meantime let this defend my loyalty-
    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie
  BOLINGBROKE.

    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength  
    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop.

    Further I say, and further will maintain
    Upon his bad life to make all this good,
    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
    And consequently, like a traitor coward,
    Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood;
    Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
    Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
    To me for justice and rough chastisement;
    And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
    This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
 O, let my sovereign turn away his face
    And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
    Till I have told this slander of his blood  
    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

  MOWBRAY.

    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
    The honourable father to my foe,
    Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
    A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
    But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament
    I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
    Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.

    This is my fault.
 As for the rest appeal'd,
    It issues from the rancour of a villain,
    A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
    Which in myself I boldly will defend,
    And interchangeably hurl down my gage
    Upon this overweening traitor's foot
    To prove myself a loyal gentleman
    Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
 To be a make-peace shall become my age.

  KING RICHARD.

    There is no boot.

    I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffl'd here;
    Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,  
    The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
    Which breath'd this poison.
 Rage must be withstood:
    Give me his gage-lions make leopards tame.

    A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
    Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.

  GAUNT.

    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
    Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.
 Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.

    As much good stay with thee as go with me!  
  DUCHESS.
 My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
  AUMERLE.
 Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
    For nothing but his Majesty's approach.

    Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;
    As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
  MOWBRAY.
 What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither
    Before King Richard in his royal lists?
    Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
    Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
  BOLINGBROKE.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
    And bow my knee before his Majesty;  
    For Mowbray and myself are like two men
    That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.

  MARSHAL.
 O, let no noble eye profane a tear
    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.

    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.

  GAUNT.
 God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
    Be swift like lightning in the execution,
    And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
    Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
    Of thy adverse pernicious enemy.

    Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant, and live.

    Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
    Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.

  KING RICHARD.
 Farewell, my lord, securely I espy
    Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
 Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
 [To an officer] Go bear this lance to Thomas,
      Duke of Norfolk.

  SECOND HERALD.

    Withdraw with us; and let the trumpets sound
    While we return these dukes what we decree.
 Your will be done.

  KING RICHARD.

  MOWBRAY.

    The language I have learnt these forty years,
    My native English, now I must forgo;
    And now my tongue's use is to me no more
    Than an unstringed viol or a harp;  
    Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up
    Or, being open, put into his hands
    That knows no touch to tune the harmony.

    Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
    Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
    And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance
    Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
 Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.
 Thy sad aspect
    Hath from the number of his banish'd years
    Pluck'd four away.
 [To BOLINGBROKE] Six frozen winters spent,
    Return with welcome home from banishment.

  KING RICHARD.

  GAUNT.

    You urg'd me as a judge; but I had rather
    You would have bid me argue like a father.
 Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,
    From where you do remain let paper show.
 My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride
    As far as land will let me by your side.

  GAUNT.
 Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
 The sullen passage of thy weary steps
    Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
    The precious jewel of thy home return.
 Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
    Will but remember me what a deal of world
    I wander from the jewels that I love.

    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
    To foreign passages; and in the end,
    Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
    But that I was a journeyman to grief?
  GAUNT.
 Woe doth the heavier sit
    Where it perceives it is but faintly home.

  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.


                     Enter BUSHY

    Bushy, what news?  
  BUSHY.

    Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain;
    For they breathe truth that breathe their words -in pain.

    He that no more must say is listen'd more
    Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
    More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before.

    Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-
    So it be new, there's no respect how vile-
    That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears?
    Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
    Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.

    Direct not him whose way himself will choose.

  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.

  GAUNT.

    He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
    As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
 My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
 Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
    Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

    So much for that.

  YORK.

    I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.

    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
    Or else he never would compare between-
  KING RICHARD.
 O my liege,  
    Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas'd
    Not to be pardoned, am content withal.
 I'll not be by the while.

    And we create, in absence of ourself,
    Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England;
    For he is just, and always lov'd us well.
 And living too; for now his son is Duke.

  WILLOUGHBY.

  ROSS.

    More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
 The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  WILLOUGHBY.
 Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay
    In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence
    That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
    That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
    His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
    Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
    Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint-
    All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,  
    With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
    Are making hither with all due expedience,
    And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.

    Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
    The first departing of the King for Ireland.

  ROSS.

  WILLOUGHBY.
 Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
 Then, thrice-gracious Queen,
    More than your lord's departure weep not-more is not seen;
    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

  QUEEN.
 Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
    And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
  GREEN.

  QUEEN.
 Despair not, madam.
 Who shall hinder me?
    I will despair, and be at enmity
    With cozening hope-he is a flatterer,
    A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
    Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
    Which false hope lingers in extremity.
 With signs of war about his aged neck.

    O, full of careful business are his looks!
    Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.

    Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
    Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.
 Both are my kinsmen.
-Come, cousin,
    I'll dispose of you.
 And that is the wavering commons; for their love
    Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them,
    By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

  BAGOT.
 If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
    Because we ever have been near the King.

    Will you go along with us?
  BAGOT.
 That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

  GREEN.

    Farewell at once-for once, for all, and ever.

    But I bethink me what a weary way
    From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
    In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
    Which, I protest, hath very much beguil'd
    The tediousness and process of my travel.
 By this the weary lords
    Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done  
    By sight of what I have, your noble company.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 What was his reason?
    He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together.
 Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
  PERCY.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
 My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
    Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young;
    Which elder days shall ripen, and confirm
    To more approved service and desert.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 I wot your love pursues
    A banish'd traitor.
 Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
 My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.

  BOLINGBROKE.

  BERKELEY.

    I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'
    In an ungracious mouth is but profane.

    And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
    Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.

    I am denied to sue my livery here,
    And yet my letters patents give me leave.
 So, fare you well;
    Unless you please to enter in the castle,
    And there repose you for this night.
 My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
    And hardly kept our countrymen together,
    And yet we hear no tidings from the King;
    Therefore we will disperse ourselves.
 Our countrymen are gone and fled,
    As well assur'd Richard their King is dead.

SCENE 2.

The coast of Wales.
 Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
  AUMERLE.
 I weep for joy
    To stand upon my kingdom once again.

    As a long-parted mother with her child
    Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
    So weeping-smiling greet I thee, my earth,
    And do thee favours with my royal hands.

    Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
    Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
    But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
    And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way,
    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet  
    Which with usurping steps do trample thee;
    Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,
    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
 Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not  
    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.

    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel.
 But who comes here?

                   Enter SCROOP
  
  SCROOP.
 Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

  AUMERLE.
 No matter where-of comfort no man speak.

    Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
    Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
    Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.

    I live with bread like you, feel want,
    Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
    How can you say to me I am a king?
  CARLISLE.
 My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
    But presently prevent the ways to wail.

  KING RICHARD.
 Proud Bolingbroke, I come
    To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
 My liege, one word.

  KING RICHARD.
 He does me double wrong
    That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.

  YORK.
 The time hath been,
    Would you have been so brief with him, he would
    Have been so brief with you to shorten you,
    For taking so the head, your whole head's length.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Royally!
    Why, it contains no king?
  PERCY.

    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.

    And though you think that all, as you have done,
    Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
    And we are barren and bereft of friends,  
    Yet know-my master, God omnipotent,
    Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
    Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
    Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
    That lift your vassal hands against my head
    And threat the glory of my precious crown.

    Tell Bolingbroke, for yon methinks he stands,
    That every stride he makes upon my land
    Is dangerous treason; he is come to open
    The purple testament of bleeding war;
    But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
    Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
    Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
    Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
    To scarlet indignation, and bedew
    Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
    Should so with civil and uncivil arms
    Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin,
    Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand;  
    And by the honourable tomb he swears
    That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
    And by the royalties of both your bloods,
    Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
    And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
    And by the worth and honour of himself,
    Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
    His coming hither hath no further scope
    Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg
    Enfranchisement immediate on his knees;
    Which on thy royal party granted once,
    His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
    His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
    To faithful service of your Majesty.
 Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
    His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
    And all the number of his fair demands
    Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction.

    [To AUMERLE] We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
    To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
    Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
    Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
  AUMERLE.
 O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
    That laid the sentence of dread banishment
    On yon proud man should take it off again
    With words of sooth! O that I were as great
    As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
    Or that I could forget what I have been!
    Or not remember what I must be now!
    Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
    Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

  KING RICHARD.

    I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
    My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
    My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
    My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,
    My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
    My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
    And my large kingdom for a little grave,
    A little little grave, an obscure grave-
    Or I'll be buried in the king's high way,
    Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
    May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
    For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,
    And buried once, why not upon my head?
    Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
    We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
    Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
    And make a dearth in this revolting land.


          Enter the KING, and his attendants, below

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
    To make the base earth proud with kissing it.

  BOLINGBROKE.
         Flourish.
 My legs can keep no measure in delight,
    When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief;
    Therefore no dancing, girl; some other sport.
 Madam, we'll tell tales.
 Of neither, girl;
    For if of joy, being altogether wanting,
    It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
    Or if of grief, being altogether had,
    It adds more sorrow to my want of joy;  
    For what I have I need not to repeat,
    And what I want it boots not to complain.
 Madam, I'll sing.
 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;
    But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.
 I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

    Let's step into the shadow of these trees.

    My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
    They will talk of state, for every one doth so
    Against a change: woe is forerun with woe.
 Why should we, in the compass of a pale,
    Keep law and form and due proportion,
    Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
    When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
    Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers chok'd up,
    Her fruit trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,
    Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs
    Swarming with caterpillars?
  GARDENER.
 What, are they dead?
  GARDENER.
 Superfluous branches
    We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;
    Had he done so, himself had home the crown,
    Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

  SERVANT.
 Depress'd he is already, and depos'd
    'Tis doubt he will be.

    In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
    And some few vanities that make him light;
    But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
    Besides himself, are all the English peers,  
    And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.

 SCENE 1.

  BAGOT.

    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted
    I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length,
    That reacheth from the restful English Court
    As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
    Amongst much other talk that very time  
    I heard you say that you had rather refuse
    The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
    Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
    Adding withal, how blest this land would be
    In this your cousin's death.
 As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
 Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
    That Norfolk lies.

  CARLISLE.
 That honourable day shall never be seen.

    Ascend his throne, descending now from him-
    And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
  BOLINGBROKE.

  CARLISLE.

    My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
    To keep him safely till his day of trial.

    Here, cousin,
    On this side my hand, and on that side thine.
 My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    My care is loss of care, by old care done;
    Your care is gain of care, by new care won.

    The cares I give I have, though given away;
    They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
 My lord, dispatch; read o'er these  
    articles.

    And yet salt water blinds them not so much
    But they can see a sort of traitors here.
 My lord-
  KING RICHARD.

                                               Exit an attendant
  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 They shall be satisfied.


                Re-enter attendant with glass

    Give me that glass, and therein will I read.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see.

    There lies the substance; and I thank thee, king,
    For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st
    Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way
    How to lament the cause.

    Being so great, I have no need to beg.
 Then give me leave to go.

 Yet look up, behold,
    That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
    And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
 Hie thee to France,
    And cloister thee in some religious house.

  QUEEN.
 My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;  
    You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.

    The love of wicked men converts to fear;
    That fear to hate; and hate turns one or both
    To worthy danger and deserved death.

  QUEEN.
 And must we be divided? Must we part?
  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.

    Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.

    Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
    Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief.

    That I may strive to kill it with a groan.

The DUKE OF YORK's palace

Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS

  DUCHESS.
 My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
    When weeping made you break the story off,
    Of our two cousins' coming into London.
 Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,
    Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
    Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
    With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
    Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'
    You would have thought the very windows spake,
    So many greedy looks of young and old
    Through casements darted their desiring eyes
    Upon his visage; and that all the walls
    With painted imagery had said at once  
    'Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!'
    Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
    Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
    Bespake them thus, 'I thank you, countrymen.
  
    But heaven hath a hand in these events,
    To whose high will we bound our calm contents.

    To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
    Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

    God knows I had as lief be none as one.
 Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
    Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
 If God prevent not, I purpose so.

    I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
 I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.

    I will appeach the villain.
 I will not peace.

  YORK.
 Away, be gone.

    Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
    For there, they say, he daily doth frequent
    With unrestrained loose companions,
    Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes
    And beat our watch and rob our passengers,
    Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
    Takes on the point of honour to support
    So dissolute a crew.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 But who comes here?

                Enter AUMERLE amazed

  AUMERLE.
 Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.

 [Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I.

    Speak with me, pity me, open the door.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.

 Sweet York, be patient.
 Not yet, I thee beseech.
 Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

  DUCHESS.

    An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
    'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.

    I never long'd to hear a word till now;
    Say 'pardon,' King; let pity teach thee how.
 Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
    Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,  
    That sets the word itself against the word!
    Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
    The chopping French we do not understand.
 O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
    Yet am I sick for fear.
 With all my heart
    I pardon him.
 Come, my old son; I pray God make thee new.
 These were his very words.

'  
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.

    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
 How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.

    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.

    O, how it ern'd my heart, when I beheld,
    In London streets, that coronation-day,
    When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary-
    That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
    That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
  KING RICHARD.
 So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.

  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.
 My lord, will't please you to fall to?
  KING RICHARD.
 Help, help, help!
    The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed
  KING RICHARD.
 O, would the deed were good!
    For now the devil, that told me I did well,
    Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
       Exeunt




SCENE 6.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Great King, within this coffin I present
    Thy buried fear.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
    To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.

 SCENE 1.

    Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul.
 Here Clarence comes.
 What means this armed guard
    That waits upon your Grace?
  CLARENCE.

  GLOUCESTER.

    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
    Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
 Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
    'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
    That tempers him to this extremity.
 Humbly complaining to her deity
    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
 I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
    That no man shall have private conference,
    Of what degree soever, with your brother.
 Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
    fellow,
    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
    Were best to do it secretly alone.
 We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
    obey.

  GLOUCESTER.
 We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.

    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
    And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
    Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-  
    I will perform it to enfranchise you.

    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
 Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.

    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?

                       Enter LORD HASTINGS

  HASTINGS.

  GLOUCESTER.

  HASTINGS.
 More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

    O, he hath kept an evil diet long
    And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
    'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
 He is.
 Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
 What black magician conjures up this fiend
    To stop devoted charitable deeds?
  GLOUCESTER.

    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
    Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.

  ANNE.

    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
    By circumstance but to acquit myself.
 Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
    Of these known evils but to give me leave
    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.

  GLOUCESTER.
 By such despair I should accuse myself.

  ANNE.
 Say that I slew them not?  
  ANNE.
 Then say they were not slain.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
  GLOUCESTER.

  ANNE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
  GLOUCESTER.

  ANNE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
    Did it to help thee to a better husband.
  
  ANNE.
 Name him.
 The self-same name, but one of better nature.
  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
    at me?
  ANNE.
 Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
 Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
 Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
  GLOUCESTER.

    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
    No, when my father York and Edward wept
    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made  
    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
    Told the sad story of my father's death,
    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
 That was in thy rage.

    Speak it again, and even with the word
    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
 I would I knew thy heart.
 Then never was man true.

  ANNE.

    Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
 Bid me farewell.
 Sirs, take up the corse.

                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
    Was ever woman in this humour won?
    I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.

    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
    And entertain a score or two of tailors
    To study fashions to adorn my body.
 Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
    Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

  GREY.
 In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
    Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 The loss of such a lord includes all
    harms.

    Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
 I do beseech you, either not believe
    The envious slanders of her false accusers;
    Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
    Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
    From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.

    Since every Jack became a gentleman,
    There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
  RIVERS.
 What, marry, may she?  
  GLOUCESTER.
 My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
    borne
    Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.

    By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
    Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.

    'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Out, devil! I do remember them to
    well:
    Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
 Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
    King,
    I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
    A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
    A liberal rewarder of his friends;
    To royalize his blood I spent mine own.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Which God revenge!
  GLOUCESTER.

    I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
    Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
 My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
    We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
  
    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
    For I am she, and altogether joyless.

    Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
    If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
    Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
  GLOUCESTER.
 God, I pray him,
    That none of you may live his natural age,
    But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
  GLOUCESTER.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  HASTINGS.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
 And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
 Have done, have done.
 Nor no one here; for curses never pass
    The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
    Have not to do with him, beware of him;
    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
    And all their ministers attend on him.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
 And so doth mine.
 I never did her any to my knowledge.

    I was too hot to do somebody good
    That is too cold in thinking of it now.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Catesby, I come.
 Lords, will you go
    with me?
  RIVERS.

  GLOUCESTER.

    The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
    I lay unto the grievous charge of others.

    Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
    I do beweep to many simple gulls;
    Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
    And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies  
    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
  
    But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
    Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
    For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
    May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.


London.

  CLARENCE.
 Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
    And in my company my brother Gloucester,
    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
    Upon the hatches.
 Thence we look'd toward England,
    And cited up a thousand heavy times,
    During the wars of York and Lancaster,
    That had befall'n us.
 Had you such leisure in the time of death
    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
  CLARENCE.

  KEEPER.

    The first that there did greet my stranger soul
    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
    And so he vanish'd.
  
    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
    Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
    Could not believe but that I was in hell,
    Such terrible impression made my dream.

  KEEPER.
 Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.

  BRAKENBURY.
 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
    sleeping.
 The urging of that word judgment hath  
    bred a kind of remorse in me.
 I thought thou hadst been resolute.

  SECOND MURDERER.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 I hope this
    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
    hold me but while one tells twenty.
 How dost thou feel thyself now?
    SECOND MURDERER.
 Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
    are yet within me.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
    none will entertain it.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 'Tis a blushing shame-
    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
    that-by chance I found.
 It beggars any man that keeps it.
 I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
    me.
 No, we'll reason with him.

  CLARENCE.
 A man, as you are.

  CLARENCE.
  
  FIRST MURDERER.
 How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
    Your eyes do menace me.
 To, to, to-
  CLARENCE.
 You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.

  SECOND MURDERER.

  SECOND MURDERER.

  SECOND MURDERER.
  
  FIRST MURDERER.
 Who made thee then a bloody minister
    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?  
  CLARENCE.
 My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 If you do love my brother, hate not me;
    I am his brother, and I love him well.

  SECOND MURDERER.
 O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.

  CLARENCE.

    CLARENCE.
 Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
 Make peace with God, for you must die,
    my lord.
 Relent, and save your souls.
 Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
 I would he knew that I had sav'd his
    brother!
    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.
            Exit

  BUCKINGHAM.
  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
    doth turn his hate
    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
    Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
    With hate in those where I expect most love!
    When I have most need to employ a friend
    And most assured that he is a friend,
    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
    Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
    When I am cold in love to you or yours.
 Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.

    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
    Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,  
    If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
    That all without desert have frown'd on me;
    Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
    Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.

    I thank my God for my humility.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
    To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
 Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.

    God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
    Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
    Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
    And yet go current from suspicion!

                           Enter DERBY

  DERBY.

  DERBY.
 The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
 And so will I.
  
  DUCHESS.

    Incapable and shallow innocents,
    You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
 I cannot think it.
 To make an act of tragic violence.
 Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
  DAUGHTER.

  CHILDREN.
 What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

  DUCHESS.
 Was never widow had so dear a loss.

    Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
    Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
 Comfort, dear mother.

  RIVERS.


               Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,
                      HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF

  GLOUCESTER.
 Humbly on my knee  
    I crave your blessing.

    Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
    To no apparent likelihood of breach,
    Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
    Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
    That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
 My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
    For by the way I'll sort occasion,
    As index to the story we late talk'd of,
    To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
        Exeunt




SCENE 3.
 Good morrow, neighbour.

    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
 In him there is a hope of government,
    Which, in his nonage, council under him,
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
 Why, so hath this, both by his father and
    mother.

    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
    And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
    This sickly land might solace as before.

  FIRST CITIZEN.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.

    But leave it all to God.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
 Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
    In him that did object the same to thee.
 His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
    born.

  YORK.
 If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
 A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
    shrewd.
 Well, madam, and in health.
 The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
    The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
    Insulting tyranny begins to jet
    Upon the innocent and aweless throne.

ACT III.

    God keep you from them and from such false friends!
  PRINCE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Welcome, my lord.
 On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
    The Queen your mother and your brother York
    Have taken sanctuary.

    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
 I go, my lord.
 He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

  PRINCE.
 Upon record, my gracious lord.

  PRINCE.

    Too late he died that might have kept that title,
    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
 O, my lord,
    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
 And therefore is he idle?
  GLOUCESTER.

  YORK.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
    Because that I am little, like an ape,
    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
 With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
  
  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
 An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
 Think you, my lord, this little prating York
    Was not incensed by his subtle mother
    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?  
  GLOUCESTER.
 O, 'tis a perilous boy;
    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.

    He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
 Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
  CATESBY.
 At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
 Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
    perceive
    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
  GLOUCESTER.
 Chop off his head-something we will
    determine.
 And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
 One from the Lord Stanley.

  HASTINGS.
 So it appears by that I have to say.
 I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
 Many good morrows to my noble lord!
  HASTINGS.
 But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
    That they which brought me in my master's hate,
    I live to look upon their tragedy.
 My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.

    You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
    I do not like these several councils, I.

  HASTINGS.

    This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
    Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.

  HASTINGS.
 Come, come, have with you.
 They, for their truth, might better wear their
    heads
    Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.

    But come, my lord, let's away.
 Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
 I thank your honour.

  
                            Enter BUCKINGHAM

  BUCKINGHAM.
 What, talking with a priest, Lord
    Chamberlain!
    Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
    Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
 Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
-
    Come, will you go?
  HASTINGS.
 Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
    Buckingham,
    Then curs'd she Hastings.

  RIVERS.
 Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
 Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
    herein?
    Who is most inward with the noble Duke?
  BISHOP OF ELY.
 My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
    bolder;  
    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
 Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
 Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.

  HASTINGS.
 The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
    Makes me most forward in this princely presence
    To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.

    And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
    Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
 If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
  GLOUCESTER.
 If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.

                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF  
  HASTINGS.

    O, now I need the priest that spake to me!
    I now repent I told the pursuivant,
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies
    To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
    And I myself secure in grace and favour.

    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
    Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
  RATCLIFF.

  LOVEL.

  HASTINGS.
 Lord Mayor-
  GLOUCESTER.
 Hark! a drum.
 So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.

    Would you imagine, or almost believe-
    Were't not that by great preservation
    We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor
    This day had plotted, in the council-house,
    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.
 What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
    Or that we would, against the form of law,
    Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
    But that the extreme peril of the case,
    The peace of England and our persons' safety,
    Enforc'd us to this execution?
  MAYOR.
 Yet had we not determin'd he should die
    Until your lordship came to see his end-
    Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
    Something against our meanings, have prevented-
    Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
    The traitor speak, and timorously confess
    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
    That you might well have signified the same
    Unto the citizens, who haply may
    Misconster us in him and wail his death.
 And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
    T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world.

                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR
  GLOUCESTER.

    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
 Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
    As if the golden fee for which I plead
    Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.

  GLOUCESTER.
 If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
    Castle;
    Where you shall find me well accompanied
    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.
          Exit




SCENE 7.

    And when mine oratory drew toward end
    I bid them that did love their country's good
    Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'
  GLOUCESTER.
 No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
    But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
    Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
'
    And even here brake off and came away.

    He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
    Divinely bent to meditation;
    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
    To draw him from his holy exercise.

  BUCKINGHAM.
  
  CATESBY.
 I'll signify so much unto him straight.
 Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
    But on his knees at meditation;
    Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
    But meditating with two deep divines;
    Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.

    Happy were England would this virtuous prince
    Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;
    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
 Sorry I am my noble cousin should
    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.


           Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.

    Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,  
    Lend favourable ear to our requests,
    And pardon us the interruption
    Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
 My lord, there needs no such apology:
    I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
    Who, earnest in the service of my God,
    Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.

    But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
  BUCKINGHAM.

    First, if all obstacles were cut away,
    And that my path were even to the crown,
    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,  
    So mighty and so many my defects,
    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-
    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-
    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
    And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 My lord, this argues conscience in your
    Grace;
    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
    All circumstances well considered.

    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;  
    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-
    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-
    And afterward by substitute betroth'd
    To Bona, sister to the King of France.

    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.

    More bitterly could I expostulate,
    Save that, for reverence to some alive,
    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
 Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
 I am not made of stones,
    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 SCENE 1.

    The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 The Lord protect him from that kingly
    title!
    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
    I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?
  DUCHESS.

    Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
    And take thy office from thee on my peril.
  
  BRAKENBURY.

  DUCHESS.

  ANNE.
 No, why? When he that is my husband now
    Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
    When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
    Which issued from my other angel husband,
    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
    O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
    This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd
    For making me, so young, so old a widow;
    And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
    More miserable by the life of thee
    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.
 Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
  ANNE.
  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good
    fortune guide thee!
    [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend
    thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good
    thoughts possess thee!
    I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
    Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
    And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
  
    Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
    Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
    Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
 Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY,
RATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others

  KING RICHARD.
 Give me thy hand.

    But shall we wear these glories for a day;
    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  BUCKINGHAM.
  
  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.
 O bitter consequence:
    That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!
    Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.

    And I would have it suddenly perform'd.

    Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
  BUCKINGHAM.
 I partly know the man.
 Go, call him hither,
    boy.
                                               Exit PAGE
    The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
    No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.

  
                            Enter STANLEY

    How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?
  STANLEY.
 Know, my loving lord,
    The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
    To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
 Rumour it abroad
    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
    I will take order for her keeping close.
 Art thou, indeed?
  TYRREL.

  KING RICHARD.
 Rise, and lend thine ear.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey  
    Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
 Ay, what's o'clock?
  BUCKINGHAM.
  
  KING RICHARD.
 Well, let it strike.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
    With such contempt? Made I him King for this?
    O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
    To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit




SCENE 3.

    Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
    And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
 If to have done the thing you gave in charge
    Beget your happiness, be happy then,
    For it is done.

  KING RICHARD.
 Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
    And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,  
    Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

    Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.
 Who comes here?
                                                       [Retires]

           Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
    babes!
    My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
    If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
    And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,  
    Hover about me with your airy wings
    And hear your mother's lamentation.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Hover about her; say that right for right
    Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
 So many miseries have craz'd my voice
    That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 When holy Harry died, and my sweet
    son.
  
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
    God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

    Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
    Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
    And send them thither.

    Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
    To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.

    Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
    That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
      days;
    Compare dead happiness with living woe;
    Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
    And he that slew them fouler than he is.
 My words are dull; O, quicken them
    with thine!
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Madam, I have a touch of your condition
    That cannot brook the accent of reproof.

  DUCHESS.
 Do, then; but I'll not hear.
 Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
    God knows, in torment and in agony.
 And came I not at last to comfort you?
  DUCHESS.

    A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
    Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
    Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;
    Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
    Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,  
    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.

  KING RICHARD.
 So.
 Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
    Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
    Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
    And never more behold thy face again.

    Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
    Which in the day of battle tire thee more  
    Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
    My prayers on the adverse party fight;
    And there the little souls of Edward's children
    Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
    And promise them success and victory.

  KING RICHARD.

    Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
 And must she die for this? O, let her
      live,
    And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,  
    Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
    Throw over her the veil of infamy;
    So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
    I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
 Wrong not her birth; she is a royal
    Princess.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

  KING RICHARD.
 Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
    And dangerous success of bloody wars,
    As I intend more good to you and yours
    Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
    heads?
  KING RICHARD.
 Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,
    The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
 Be brief, lest that the process of thy
      kindness
    Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
    And do intend to make her Queen of England.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Even he that makes her Queen.
 Send to her, by the man that slew her  
    brothers,
    A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
    'Edward' and 'York.
 You mock me, madam; this is not the way
    To win your daughter.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 There is no other way;
    Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
    And not be Richard that hath done all this.

    If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
    To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.

    The loss you have is but a son being King,
    And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.

    Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
    This fair alliance quickly shall can home
    To high promotions and great dignity.

    The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
    Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
    Advantaging their loan with interest
    Of ten times double gain of happiness.
 Tell her the King, that may command,
    entreats.
 Say I will love her everlastingly.
 As long as hell and Richard likes of it.

  KING RICHARD.
 O, no, my reasons are too deep and
      dead-
    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.

  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.
 Thy life hath it dishonour'd.

  KING RICHARD.
 The time to come.
 That thou hast wronged in the time
    o'erpast;
    For I myself have many tears to wash
    Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.

    Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
    Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.

    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-
    Be the attorney of my love to her;
    Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
    Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.

  KING RICHARD.
 Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
  KING RICHARD.

    'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
    And there they hull, expecting but the aid
    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
 Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
    Norfolk.

  KING RICHARD.
 Catesby, fly to the Duke.
 O, true, good Catesby.
 What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
  KING RICHARD.
 Why, what wouldst thou do there before I
    go?
  RATCLIFF.
 Your Highness told me I should post before.
 My mind is chang'd.


                           Enter LORD STANLEY

  STANLEY, what news with you?
  STANLEY.

  KING RICHARD.
 There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
    White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
  STANLEY.

  KING RICHARD.
 Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
 Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
    Are they not now upon the western shore,
    Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
  STANLEY.

  KING RICHARD.
 Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
    Richmond;
    But I'll not trust thee.
 Look your heart be firm,
    Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
         Exit

                          Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.
 In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
    arms;
    And every hour more competitors
    Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.

    But this good comfort bring I to your Highness-
    The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest.

    Farewell.
 Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and
    Rivers,
    Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
    Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
    By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
    If that your moody discontented souls
    Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
    Even for revenge mock my destruction!
    This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?
  SHERIFF.


Camp near Tamworth

Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT, SIR WALTER HERBERT, and others,
with drum and colours

  RICHMOND.

    The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
    That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
    Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
    In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
    Is now even in the centre of this isle,
    Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.

  OXFORD.
 My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

  KING RICHARD.
 Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
    not?
  NORFOLK.
 We must both give and take, my loving lord.

  KING RICHARD.

    I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
    Limit each leader to his several charge,
    And part in just proportion our small power.

  BLUNT.
 Good night, good Captain Blunt.
  
                                   [They withdraw into the tent]

            Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,
                       RATCLIFF, and CATESBY

  KING RICHARD.
 I will not sup to-night.

    What, is my beaver easier than it was?
    And all my armour laid into my tent?
  CATESBY.
 Catesby!
  CATESBY.
 Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord
    Northumberland?
  RATCLIFF.
 Give me a bowl of wine.
 It is, my lord.

  KING RICHARD.
 RICHARD sleeps

               Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;
                        LORDS attending

  DERBY.
 Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  RICHMOND.
 I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
    Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
 The silent hours steal on,
    And flaky darkness breaks within the east.

    God give us leisure for these rites of love!
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!
  RICHMOND.

    Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
  
    Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!

           Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN

  GHOST OF RIVERS.
 Despair and die.

    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
    And fall thy edgeless sword.
 Despair and die.

    [To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
    Dream of success and happy victory.


                   Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM

  GHOST.
 Give me another horse.
 Bind up my wounds.
 Fool, do not flatter.
 Zounds, who is there?
  RATCLIFF.
 The early village-cock
    Hath twice done salutation to the morn;  
    Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
 O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
    What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
  RATCLIFF.

  KING RICHARD.
 O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
 The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
    That ever ent'red in a drowsy head
    Have I since your departure had, my lords.

  RICHMOND.

    For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
    A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
    One that made means to come by what he hath,
    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
    A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
    Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
    One that hath ever been God's enemy.

    Then, in the name of God and all these rights,  
    Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
 What said Northumberland as touching
    Richmond?
  RATCLIFF.
 That he was never trained up in arms.
'
  KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
  
    Who saw the sun to-day?
  RATCLIFF.
 Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
    He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.

    Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
    More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
    That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

  KING RICHARD.

    John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
    Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.

                                        [He sheweth him a paper]
  KING RICHARD.
'
    A thing devised by the enemy.

    Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.

    March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
    If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.


                      His ORATION to his ARMY

    What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
    Remember whom you are to cope withal-
    A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
    A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
    Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
    To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.

    And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
    Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
    A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
    Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
    Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
    Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,
    These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
    Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
    For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves.

    Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,
    Ravish our daughters?  [Drum afar off]  Hark! I hear their
    drum.

  KING RICHARD.
 Enter KING RICHARD

  KING RICHARD.


Another part of the field

Alarum.
 Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight; RICHARD is slain.

Retreat and flourish.
 He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
    Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
 John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
    Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
 Inter their bodies as becomes their births.

  Mercutio, kinsman to the Prince and friend to Romeo.

  Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo
  Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet.

  Friar Laurence, Franciscan.
  
  Three Musicians.

  An Officer.
--Verona; Mantua.
 Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

                                                         [Exit.


Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet.

  Greg.

  Samp.
 I strike quickly, being moved.
 But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

  Greg.

  Samp.
 A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
 I will take the
    wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
 I will show myself a tyrant.

    Take it in what sense thou wilt.

  Greg.
 Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
    am a pretty piece of flesh.

  Greg.
 Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
    Montagues.

  Greg.
 I fear thee!
  Samp.
 I will bite my thumb at them; which is
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.

  Abr.
 I do bite my thumb, sir.
 Do you quarrel, sir?
  Abr.

  Samp.

  Abr.
 No better.
 [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.

  Ben.
 You know not what you do.


                          Enter Tybalt.

  Ben.
 What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
 Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
 A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
  Cap.


  Mon.
 Wife.


                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
 Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,  
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.

    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.

    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
 In the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.

    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
 My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  Mon.
 I neither know it nor can learn of him
  Ben.
 Come, madam, let's away,  
                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
 Ay me! sad hours seem long.

    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!  
    O anything, of nothing first create!
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

    Dost thou not laugh?
  Ben.
 No, coz, I rather weep.
 This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
 Soft! I will go along.
 Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.

  Ben.
 She hath Dian's wit,
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.

    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,  
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
 She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
 Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.

 And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

    Come, go with me.

  Serv.
 I must to the learned.
 Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
 Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.


  Wife.

  Nurse.

  Nurse.
 How long is it now
    To Lammastide?
  Wife.

  Nurse.

    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
    Were of an age.
 But, as I said,
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.

    Nay, I do bear a brain.

    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.
 Yes, madam.
 Yet I cannot choose but laugh  
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.
'
  Jul.
 And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
 Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
 Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
 No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
  Wife.

  Wife.
 Borrow Cupid's wings
    And soar with them above a common bound.

    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.

  Rom.

  Mer.
 Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears.

    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

  Rom.
 In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;  
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.

    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Then dreams he of another benefice.

    This is she-
  Rom.
 Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
 This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.


  1.
 Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
  2.
 Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
 Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
 Cap.
 What, dares the slave
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

  Cap.
 Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
    A villain, that is hither come in spite
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
  
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
 Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

  Cap.

    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.

  Rom.
 Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

  Jul.
  
  Rom.
 Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
    Give me my sin again.
]
  Jul.

  Nurse.
 Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
] Come on then, let's to bed.
 I know not.

  Jul.
 My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
  
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.

  Rom.

                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.
 Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
  Mer.
 Nay, I'll conjure too.

    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.

    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
    Romeo, good night.
 Go then, for 'tis in vain
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.

Capulet's orchard.


Enter Romeo.
  
  Jul.
 [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
  Jul.

    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
 I take thee at thy word.
  
  Jul.
 How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

  Rom.

  Jul.
 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.
 I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.

    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
 Yet, if thou swear'st,
    Thou mayst prove false.

  Rom.

  Rom.
 Well, do not swear.
 Although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.

    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.

    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
 Dear love, adieu!
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
                [Exit.


                       Enter Juliet above.
 By-and-by I come.
 So thrive my soul-
  Jul.
 A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.


                     Enter Juliet again, [above].
 By the hour of nine.

  Jul.

  Rom.
 I would have thee gone-
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
 I would I were thy bird.

    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.

    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live  
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.

  Rom.

    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.

    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

  Friar.
 For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

  Rom.
 Not in a grave
    To lay one in, another out to have.

    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove  
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

  Friar.

  Ben.

  Mer.
 Why, what is Tybalt?  
  Mer.
 More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you.
 Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she had a
    better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
    but not to the purpose.
 Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    salutation to your French slop.
 Can you not conceive?
  Rom.

  Mer.

  Mer.
 Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy
    pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.

  Rom.

  Mer.
 I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

  Rom.

  Rom.
 Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
 Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
 Anon.

  Nurse.
 I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have
    found him than he was when you sought him.
 I am the youngest of
    that name, for fault of a worse.
 You say well.

  Mer.

  Nurse.

  Ben.
 She will endite him to some supper.

  Mer.

  Nurse.
 If I had, my weapon
    should quickly have been out, I warrant you.
 I dare draw as soon
    as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law
    on my side.
 I protest unto
    thee-  
  Nurse.
 Go to! I say you shall.

  Rom.
 I anger
    her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but
    I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout
    in the versal world.
 Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name.

    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
 Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
 How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay  
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.

    What, have you din'd at home?
  Jul.
 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?  
  Nurse.
 O God's Lady dear!
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.

    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

  Jul.

                                                         Exeunt.





Scene VI.

Friar Laurence's cell.
 So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
  Rom.

    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    It is enough I may but call her mine.

  Friar.

    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

  Friar.
 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

  Rom.
 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
 Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
 Scene I.
 And what to?
  Mer.
 Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for
    one would kill the other.
 An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy
    the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

  Mer.
 A word with one of you.

  Mer.

  Mer.
 Could you not take some occasion without giving
  Tyb.
 Well, peace be with you, sir.

  Rom.
 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting.
 Villain am I none.
 Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
]
    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
  Tyb.
 Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
 Come, sir, your passado!
                                                   [They fight.
 Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
 Courage, man.
 I am peppered, I warrant, for this
    world.

  Mer.
 [supported by Benvolio].

  Rom.
 This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    Hath been my kinsman.
 O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
 Why dost thou stay?
                                                     Exit Romeo.
 Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
  Ben.

  Citizen.
 Up, sir, go with me.
 Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
 Wife.

  Prince.
 And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence.

Capulet's orchard.
 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.


    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

                                             [Throws them down.
 Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
  Jul.
 Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot.

    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
'
    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.
 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
  Jul.

  Jul.
 O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!
  Nurse.

    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
 Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.

    Come, cords; come, nurse.
 I wot well where he is.
 Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.

    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.

  Rom.
 What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
  Friar.

  Rom.
 Do not say 'banishment.
'
  Friar.
 There is no world without Verona walls,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
 Calling death 'banishment,'
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
 They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
 Talk no more.

  Rom.
 Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.

  Friar.
 Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,  
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
- I come, I come!             Knock.

    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
  Nurse.


  Nurse.
 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
  Friar.
 O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!
  Friar.
 Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
 As if that name,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    Murder'd her kinsman.
 Tybalt would kill thee,
    But thou slewest Tybalt.

    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
  
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

    Romeo is coming.

  Nurse.
 O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel.

  Nurse.
           Exit.
 How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
  Friar.

Capulet's house

Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.


  Cap.

  Par.

  Cap.
 Monday, my lord.
 But what say you to Thursday?
  Par.
 My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
 A Thursday be it then.

    Farewell, My lord.

    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
 It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
    No nightingale.

  Jul.
  
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
 More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
  
                          Enter Nurse.


  Nurse.

  Jul.
 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

                                                  He goeth down.

  Jul.

    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
  Rom.
 Farewell!
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    But send him back.

    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

                       Enter Mother.
 Madam, I am not well.

    Therefore have done.
 Some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
 [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.

    Then weep no more.

  Jul.
 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

  Jul.
 These are news indeed!
  Lady.

    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
    You tallow-face!
  Lady.
 May not one speak?
  Cap.

    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
 Scene I.
 On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

  Friar.

  Par.
 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.


  Par.

  Par.

  Jul.
 What must be shall be.

  Par.

  Par.
 The tears have got small victory by that,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;  
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

  Jul.
 O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
  Friar.

    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
 Go home, be merry, give consent
    To marry Paris.
 Wednesday is to-morrow.

  Jul.

Capulet's house.

                                            [Exit a Servingman.
 Go tell him of this.

  Jul.
 Why, I am glad on't.

    This is as't should be.
 Let me see the County.
 No, not till Thursday.

                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
 Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.

  Mother.

                                             Lays down a dagger.

    I will not entertain so bad a thought.

    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,  
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Together with the terror of the place-
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    Environed with all these hideous fears,  
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.
,
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Upon a rapier's point.


Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.


  Lady.

  Nurse.
 Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
    For this night's watching.
  
  Cap.
 Make haste, make haste.

      logs.

    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

                              Enter Nurse.
 Hie, make haste,
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.

                                                       [Exeunt.
 Madam, madam, madam!
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    He'll fright you up, i' faith.

  Nurse.
 O lamentable day!
  Mother.
 Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw  
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
  Nurse.
 Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
    To murther, murther our solemnity?
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    And with my child my joys are buried!  
  Friar.
 Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
    In these confusions.

    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

  Cap.
 All things that we ordained festival  
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
    And all things change them to the contrary.

                           Exeunt.
 Mus.
 Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.


  Pet.
 Why 'Heart's ease'',

  Pet.
 You will not then?

  Pet.
 I will give you the
     minstrel.
 Mus.
 An you re us and fa us, you note us.
 Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an iron
    wit, and put up my iron dagger.
 Answer me like men.

  
           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
           Then music with her silver sound'-

    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
    What say you, Simon Catling?
  1.

  Pet.
 Faith, I know not what to say.
 I will say for you.
 It
    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold
    for sounding.

ACT V.
 Scene I.

Mantua.


  Rom.

    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    And her immortal part with angels lives.

    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
 No, my good lord.

  Rom.

                                               Exit [Balthasar].

    As I remember, this should be the house.


  Apoth.
 Come hither, man.
 I see that thou art poor.

  Apoth.
 Put this in any liquid thing you will
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.


Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.


  Laur.
 What says Romeo?
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
 I could not send it- here it is again-  
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    So fearful were they of infection.
 Give me thy torch, boy.

    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
    But thou shalt hear it.

    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
]

       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                    and a crow of iron.
 Early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.

    Give me the light.

    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
 I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
 Live, and hereafter say
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

  Rom.

                                            [Exit.
] O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick.
 Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light  
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
    It burneth in the Capels' monument.
 Romeo.

  Friar.
 How long hath he been there?
  Bal.

    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

  Friar.

                                                   Juliet rises.
 Come, come away.
 Come, I'll dispose of thee
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.

    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    To make me die with a restorative.


  Boy.
 Search about the churchyard.

    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
 Watch.
  
  Chief Watch.
 What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
  Wife.
 Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
    With instruments upon them fit to open  
    These dead men's tombs.
 I am the greatest, able to do least,
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
 Then say it once what thou dost know in this.

    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    The form of death.
 Meantime I writ to Romeo
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.

    All this I know, and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    Unto the rigour of severest law.

    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
  Bal.

    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
    If I departed not and left him there.
 I will look on it.

  Prince.

  Cap.
 SCENE I.
 Therefore, paucas
    pallabris; let the world slide.
 You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
  SLY.
 Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed
    and warm thee.
 I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.

    Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
    At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
    I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
 Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
    I would esteem him worth a dozen such.

  FIRST HUNTSMAN.

  LORD.
 Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
    And each one to his office when he wakes.
 A trumpet sounds]
    Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-  
                                                    Exit SERVANT
    Belike some noble gentleman that means,
    Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
 An't please your honour, players
    That offer service to your lordship.

  PLAYERS.

  LORD.
 For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
 Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
  THIRD SERVANT.
 Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
    As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.

    O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
    Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
    And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.

    Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd,
    Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
 Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee
      straight
    Adonis painted by a running brook,
    And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
    Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
    Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind.

  SECOND SERVANT.
 Will't please your Mightiness to wash your hands?
    O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
    O, that once more you knew but what you are!  
    These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
    Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
 O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
    For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
    Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
    And rail upon the hostess of the house,
    And say you would present her at the leet,
    Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.

  SLY.
 Amen.
 How fares my noble lord?
  SLY.
 My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
    I am your wife in all obedience.

  SLY.

  SLY.
 Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
    Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
 But I would
    be loath to fall into my dreams again.
 I will therefore tarry in
    despite of the flesh and the blood.
 Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let
    the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.

                                                 [They sit down]

Padua.
 A public place

Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO

  LUCENTIO.

  LUCENTIO.


      Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA
        and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,
        suitor to BIANCA.

  LUCENTIO.
 But in the other's silence do I see
    Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
 Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

  BAPTISTA.

  LUCENTIO.
 Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
    Sorry am I that our good will effects
    Bianca's grief.
 Farewell; yet, for the love
    I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man
    to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her
    father.
 I say a husband.

  GREMIO.
 Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to
    endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the
    world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
    faults, and money enough.

  HORTENSIO.
 But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
    shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping  
    Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free
    for a husband, and then have to't afresh.
 Sweet Bianca! Happy man
    be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.

                                     Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
  TRANIO.

    Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;  
    Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
 Go forward; this contents;
    The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
 Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
    Began to scold and raise up such a storm
    That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
  LUCENTIO.
 Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

  TRANIO.

    'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so.

    When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
    But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
 So had you need.
 Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
    And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
    Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.


                       Enter BIONDELLO.


    Here comes the rogue.

    Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
    Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
    And I for my escape have put on his;
    For in a quarrel since I came ashore
    I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.

  BIONDELLO.

  LUCENTIO.
      Exeunt

                 The Presenters above speak
  
  FIRST SERVANT.

Padua.
 Verona, for a while I take my leave,
    To see my friends in Padua; but of all
    My best beloved and approved friend,
    Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.

  PETRUCHIO.
 A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,  
    I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
    And could not get him for my heart to do it.
 Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words
    plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
    knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'?
  PETRUCHIO.

    And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
    Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
  PETRUCHIO.
 But in a few,
    Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
    Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
    And I have thrust myself into this maze,
    Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
    Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
    And so am come abroad to see the world.
  
  HORTENSIO.

    Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
    For I will board her though she chide as loud
    As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
 I know her father, though I know not her;
    And he knew my deceased father well.


        Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO

  GRUMIO.
 Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love.
 Petruchio,
    stand by awhile.
 What will you read to her?
  LUCENTIO.
 Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
    As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
    As firmly as yourself were still in place;
    Yea, and perhaps with more successful words  
    Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
 O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
  PETRUCHIO.
 Peace, sirrah!
  HORTENSIO.
 Grumio, mum!                       [Coming forward]
    God save you, Signior Gremio!
  GREMIO.
 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
    Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
    A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
    So shall I no whit be behind in duty
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

  GREMIO.
 So said, so done, is well.

    Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
  PETRUCHIO.

    My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
    And I do hope good days and long to see.

    But will you woo this wild-cat?  
  PETRUCHIO.

  HORTENSIO.
 I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
 Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
    Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
    To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
  BIONDELLO.
 Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
  TRANIO.
 Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
  PETRUCHIO.
 Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
 Sir, a word ere you go.

    Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
  TRANIO.

  HORTENSIO.

  GREMIO.
 Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
    Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
  TRANIO.

  PETRUCHIO.

  HORTENSIO.
 Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
    And since you do profess to be a suitor,
    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
    To whom we all rest generally beholding.

  HORTENSIO.
 SCENE I.
 Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
    I never yet beheld that special face
    Which I could fancy more than any other.

  KATHERINA.

    I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
 What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
          Exit KATHERINA
  BAPTISTA.
 You are too blunt; go to it orderly.

  PETRUCHIO.
 You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.
  
    I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
    That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
    Her affability and bashful modesty,
    Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
    Am bold to show myself a forward guest
    Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
    Of that report which I so oft have heard.

    Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
    His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

  BAPTISTA.
 Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
    But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
    She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
  
  BAPTISTA.

  BAPTISTA.

  GREMIO.

    Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.
 His name is Cambio.
 Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
    That, being a stranger in this city here,
    Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
    Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.

  BAPTISTA.
 A mighty man of Pisa.
 By report
    I know him well.
 Bid them use them well.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
    That shake not though they blow perpetually.
             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
    I'll attend her here,
    And woo her with some spirit when she comes.

  KATHERINA.
 Why, what's a moveable?
  KATHERINA.
 Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
 No such jade as you, if me you mean.
 Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
    And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
 Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
 Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
 Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
    In his tail.

  KATHERINA.
 What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
    Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

  KATHERINA.
 That I'll try.

    If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
    And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
  
  KATHERINA.

  PETRUCHIO.
 'Tis with cares.

  KATHERINA.
 No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.

    Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
    Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,  
    Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
    But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
    With gentle conference, soft and affable.

    Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
    O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
    Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
    As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.

    O, let me see thee walk.
 Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
 Never make denial;
    I must and will have Katherine to my wife.

  BAPTISTA.
 Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
  PETRUCHIO.
 Call you me daughter? Now I promise you  
    You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
    To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
    A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
    That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
 I choose her for myself;
    If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
    'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
    That she shall still be curst in company.

  BAPTISTA.
 I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
 Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.

                        Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally  
  GREMIO.

  TRANIO.
 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
    'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

  GREMIO.

  GREMIO.

    'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
    That can assure my daughter greatest dower  
    Shall have my Bianca's love.
  
  TRANIO.
 Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
    By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
 Else, you must pardon me;
    If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  TRANIO.

  LUCENTIO.
 Here, madam:

  BIANCA.

  HORTENSIO.
 Madam, my instrument's in tune.

  BIANCA.

  HORTENSIO.

  LUCENTIO.
 The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.

    Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

  BIANCA.
  [To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave  
      awhile;
    My lessons make no music in three Parts.
 Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

  HORTENSIO.
  [Reads]
         '"Gamut" I am, the ground of all accord-
         "A re" to plead Hortensio's passion-
         "B mi" Bianca, take him for thy lord-
         "C fa ut" that loves with all affection-
         "D sol re" one clef, two notes have I-  
         "E la mi" show pity or I die.


                       Enter a SERVANT

  SERVANT.

    You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.

    Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
    To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-
    Seize thee that list.

Padua.

    I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
    Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
    And, to be noted for a merry man,
    He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
    Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;  
    Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
 Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
 Would Katherine had never seen him though!
                    Exit, weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
  BAPTISTA.
 Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
    For such an injury would vex a very saint;
    Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
 Is it new and old too? How may that be?
  BIONDELLO.
 Is he come?
  BIONDELLO.
 When will he be here?
  BIONDELLO.

  TRANIO.
 O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like
    the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose
    on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and
    the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
    monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
    footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
 Didst thou not say he comes?
  BIONDELLO.

  BIONDELLO.
 No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.

  TRANIO.
 Not so well apparell'd
    As I wish you were.

    But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
    How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
    And wherefore gaze this goodly company
    As if they saw some wondrous monument,
    Some comet or unusual prodigy?  
  BAPTISTA.

  TRANIO.
 Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.

  LUCENTIO.
 And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?  
  GREMIO.
 Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
 Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
    I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
    Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
    'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
    That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
    And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
    This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
    That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.

    Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
         [Music plays]

       Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO,

  PETRUCHIO.

    Dine with my father, drink a health to me.

 Are you content to stay?
  PETRUCHIO.

  KATHERINA.
 Now, if you love me, stay.
 Nay, then,
    Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
    No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
    Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
 Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

  KATHERINA.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

  TRANIO.
 She shall, Lucentio.
 Come, gentlemen, let's go.

    Holla, ho! Curtis!

                            Enter CURTIS

  CURTIS.
 A piece of ice.
 If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
    shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
    neck.

  CURTIS.
 She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st
    winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old
    master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
 Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

  CURTIS.
 All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

  GRUMIO.

  GRUMIO.
 Lend thine ear.

  GRUMIO.

  GRUMIO.

  CURTIS.

  GRUMIO.

  GRUMIO.
 Who knows not that?
  GRUMIO.
 Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
 I call them forth to credit her.
 Here, here, sir; here, sir.
 Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
    You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
    What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
    Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
  GRUMIO.
 YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
    Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
    And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
  GRUMIO.

                                   Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN

    [Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?
             Where are those-

    Sit down, Kate, and welcome.
 Some water, here, what, ho!

                      Enter one with water

    Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
    And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
                                                 Exit SERVINGMAN
    One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
 Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
 A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
    Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Where is he?
  CURTIS.

    Another way I have to man my haggard,
    To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
    That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
    That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.

  LUCENTIO.
 I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.
 Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
    You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca  
    Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.

  TRANIO.
 Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
    Of your entire affection to Bianca;
    And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
    I will with you, if you be so contented,
    Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
 Ay, and he'll tame her.
 What is he, Biondello?
  BIONDELLO.

    Take in your love, and then let me alone.
 God save you, sir!
  TRANIO.

  TRANIO.
 Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
    And come to Padua, careless of your life!
  PEDANT.

    'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
    You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

  PEDANT.
 Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
    For I have bills for money by exchange
    From Florence, and must here deliver them.
 O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
    The patron of my life and liberty.

    What, did he marry me to famish me?
    Beggars that come unto my father's door
    Upon entreaty have a present alms;
    If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
    But I, who never knew how to entreat,
    Nor never needed that I should entreat,
    Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
    With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
    And that which spites me more than all these wants-
    He does it under name of perfect love;
    As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
    'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
 What say you to a neat's foot?  
  KATHERINA.

    How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
  KATHERINA.
 Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
    Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

  KATHERINA.
 Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I pray you, let it stand.
 The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
    And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

    What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
    To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.


                          Enter TAILOR

    Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
    Lay forth the gown.

  KATHERINA.
 I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
    And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

  PETRUCHIO.

    Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
    And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
 Come, tailor, let us see't.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
    More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
    Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
 Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
    Just as my master had direction.

  GRUMIO.

  TAILOR.

  PETRUCHIO.
 The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
  GRUMIO.
 Proceed.
 I confess the cape.

  TAILOR.

  TAILOR.
  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.
 Ay, there's the villainy.
 Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

  GRUMIO.
-
    Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.

  HORTENSIO.

    If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
    And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
    To feast and sport us at thy father's house.

  PETRUCHIO.

  HORTENSIO.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
    Signior Baptista may remember me
    Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
    Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
      Exit LUCENTIO
  BIONDELLO.

  TRANIO.
 Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.

  BAPTISTA.
                                 Exeunt

            Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and BIONDELLO

  BIONDELLO.
 Biondello, what of that?
  BIONDELLO.
 The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
    at all hours.
  
  LUCENTIO.

    If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
    But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
 Hear'st thou, Biondello?
  BIONDELLO.
 I cannot tarry.
 My master hath appointed me to
    go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you
    come with your appendix.
 I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
 I know it is the moon.

  HORTENSIO.


                            Enter VINCENTIO

    [To VINCENTIO]  Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-
    Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
    Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
    Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
    What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
    As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
    Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
    This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
    And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
 Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
    That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,  
    My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
    And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
    A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

    Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
    And wander we to see thy honest son,
    Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
         [Knocks]
  GREMIO.
 He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
 Do
    you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell
    Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here
    at the door to speak with him.

  VINCENTIO.
 Art thou his father?
  PEDANT.
  [To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!
    Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.
  
  PEDANT.
  [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.

  VINCENTIO.
 What, have you forgot me?
  BIONDELLO.
 I could not forget you, for I never
    saw you before in all my life.

  VINCENTIO.
 What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see
    where he looks out of the window.
 What, is the man lunatic?
  TRANIO.
 Pray, what do you  
    think is his name?
  VINCENTIO.
 Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
    only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
 Call forth an officer.

  TRANIO.

  GREMIO.
 Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
 Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!
  VINCENTIO.

  BAPTISTA.

  GREMIO.
 Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
  VINCENTIO.
 Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
    That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
  BAPTISTA.
 Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
  BIANCA.
 Bianca's love
    Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
    While he did bear my countenance in the town;
    And happily I have arrived at the last
    Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
               Exit
  BAPTISTA.
 Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
 First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

  KATHERINA.
 What, in the midst of the street?
  PETRUCHIO.

  KATHERINA.
 Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
    Better once than never, for never too late.
            [They sit]
  PETRUCHIO.

  PETRUCHIO.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Mistress, how mean you that?
  WIDOW.

  WIDOW.
 Right, I mean you.
 And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.
 How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  GREMIO.
 Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
  BIANCA.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
    Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
 She hath prevented me.

  TRANIO.

  HORTENSIO.
 Content.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Ay, and a kind one too.

    Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
    To come to me forthwith.


                            Re-enter BIONDELLO

    Now, where's my wife?
  BIONDELLO.
 What?
  HORTENSIO.
 She will not.
 What is your sir, that you send for me?
  PETRUCHIO.
 Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
  KATHERINA.

    Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.

                                                  Exit KATHERINA
  LUCENTIO.


                 Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW

    See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
    As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
 Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
    Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
  BIANCA.

  PETRUCHIO.

  WIDOW.
 And first begin with her.

  KATHERINA.

    A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.

    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,  
    Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
    And for thy maintenance commits his body
    To painful labour both by sea and land,
    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
    And craves no other tribute at thy hands
    But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
    Too little payment for so great a debt.

SCENE:
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island



THE TEMPEST
ACT I.
 Here, master; what cheer?
  MASTER.
 Good! Speak to th' mariners; fall to't yarely, or
    we run ourselves aground; bestir, bestir.
 Tend to th' master's
    whistle.

  GONZALO.
 I have great comfort from this fellow.
 Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging;
    make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
    little advantage.
 If he be not born to be hang'd, our
    case is miserable.

  GONZALO.


                    Enter MARINERS, Wet
  MARINERS.
 All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
                                                          Exeunt
  BOATSWAIN.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Before PROSPERO'S cell

Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA

  MIRANDA.
 O, woe the day!  
  PROSPERO.

  MIRANDA.
 You have often
    Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp'd,
    And left me to a bootless inquisition,
    Concluding 'Stay; not yet.
 Canst thou remember
    A time before we came unto this cell?
    I do not think thou canst; for then thou wast not
    Out three years old.

  MIRANDA.
 But that I do not.

  PROSPERO.
 I pray thee, mark me.
 I should sin
    To think but nobly of my grandmother:
    Good wombs have borne bad sons.

  PROSPERO.
 Whereon,
    A treacherous army levied, one midnight
    Fated to th' purpose, did Antonio open
    The gates of Milan; and, i' th' dead of darkness,
    The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence
    Me and thy crying self.
 Hear a little further,
    And then I'll bring thee to the present busines
    Which now's upon 's; without the which this story
    Were most impertinent.
 Wherefore did they not
    That hour destroy us?
  PROSPERO.
 There they hoist us,
    To cry to th' sea, that roar'd to us; to sigh
    To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,
    Did us but loving wrong.

  MIRANDA.
 Alack, what trouble  
    Was I then to you!
  PROSPERO.
 By Providence divine.
                    [Puts on his mantle]
    Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
 Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you,
      sir,
    For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
    For raising this sea-storm?
  PROSPERO.

                                                [MIRANDA sleeps]
    Come away, servant; come; I am ready now.
 Close by, my master.
 Not a hair perish'd;
    On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
    But fresher than before; and, as thou bad'st me,
    In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
 Safely in harbour
    Is the King's ship; in the deep nook, where once
    Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
    From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid;
    The mariners all under hatches stowed,
    Who, with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour,
    I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet,
    Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,  
    And are upon the Mediterranean flote
    Bound sadly home for Naples,
    Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd,
    And his great person perish.
 At least two glasses.
 My liberty.
 Dost thou forget
    From what a torment I did free thee?
  ARIEL.

  PROSPERO.
 Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze
    Of the salt deep,
    To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
    To do me business in the veins o' th' earth
    When it is bak'd with frost.
 I do not, sir.
 O, was she so? I must
    Once in a month recount what thou hast been,  
    Which thou forget'st.
 Ay, sir.
 Thou, my slave,
    As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
    And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
    To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
    Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
    By help of her more potent ministers,
    And in her most unmitigable rage,
    Into a cloven pine; within which rift
    Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
    A dozen years; within which space she died,
    And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
    As fast as mill-wheels strike.

  PROSPERO.

  ARIEL.
 Pardon, master;
    I will be correspondent to command,
    And do my spriting gently.

  ARIEL.

  ARIEL.
 My lord, it shall be done.
 Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
    Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

                       Enter CALIBAN

  CALIBAN.
 For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
    Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
    Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
    All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
    As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
    Than bees that made 'em.

    Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms
    Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
    For I am all the subjects that you have,
    Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me
    In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me  
    The rest o' th' island.
 But thy vile race,
    Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures
    Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
    Deservedly confin'd into this rock, who hadst  
    Deserv'd more than a prison.
 You taught me language, and my profit on't
    Is, I know how to curse.
 His art is of such pow'r,
    It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
    And make a vassal of him.
 Where should this music be? I' th' air or th'
    earth?
    It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
    Some god o' th' island.
 The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,  
    And say what thou seest yond.
 What is't? a spirit?
    Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
    It carries a brave form.
 How? the best?
    What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
  FERDINAND.
 He does hear me;
    And that he does I weep.
 Alack, for mercy!
  FERDINAND.

  PROSPERO.
 Follow me.
 Come;
    I'll manacle thy neck and feet together.
 Follow.
 Hence! Hang not on my garments.
 What!
    An advocate for an impostor! hush!
    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
    Having seen but him and Caliban.
 Come on; obey.
  
    Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
    And have no vigour in them.

    [To ARIEL]  Hark what thou else shalt do me.
 To th' syllable.

  PROSPERO.

 Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
    So have we all, of joy; for our escape
    Is much beyond our loss.
 Then wisely, good sir, weigh
    Our sorrow with our comfort.
 He receives comfort like cold porridge.
 When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
    Comes to th' entertainer-
  SEBASTIAN.
 A dollar.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Therefore, my lord-
  ANTONIO.
 Well, I have done; but yet-
  SEBASTIAN.
 Ha, ha, ha!
  SEBASTIAN.
 Yet-
  ADRIAN.
 He could not miss't.
 Temperance was a delicate wench.
 Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
    deliver'd.

  ADRIAN.
 The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
 As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
 How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
  ANTONIO.

  SEBASTIAN.

  SEBASTIAN.

  ADRIAN.
 Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
    in? Widow Dido!
  SEBASTIAN.
 She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
 I assure you, Carthage.
 His word is more than the miraculous harp.

  ANTONIO.
 I think he will carry this island home in his
    pocket, and give it his son for an apple.

  ANTONIO.

  ANTONIO.
 O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.

  ANTONIO.
 That 'sort' was well fish'd for.

  ALONSO.
 We have lost your son,
    I fear, for ever.

  ANTONIO.
 Or docks, or mallows.

  GONZALO.
 I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
    Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
    Would I admit; no name of magistrate;  
    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
    And use of service, none; contract, succession,
    Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
    No occupation; all men idle, all;
    And women too, but innocent and pure;
    No sovereignty-
  SEBASTIAN.
 No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  ANTONIO.
 None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.

  GONZALO.
 I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
    minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such
    sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh
    at nothing.
 Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
    you; so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.


          Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music

  SEBASTIAN.
 Go sleep, and hear us.

                   [All sleep but ALONSO, SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
  ALONSO.
 What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
    Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts; I find
    They are inclin'd to do so.
 Please you, sir,
    Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
    It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
    It is a comforter.
 What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  ANTONIO.
 Why
    Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
    Myself dispos'd to sleep.
 Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
 What might,
    Worthy Sebastian? O, what might! No more!
    And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
    What thou shouldst be; th' occasion speaks thee; and
    My strong imagination sees a crown
    Dropping upon thy head.
 I do; and surely
    It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
    Out of thy sleep.

  SEBASTIAN.
 I am more serious than my custom; you
    Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
    Trebles thee o'er.
 Well, I am standing water.

    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
    A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
    Which throes thee much to yield.

  ANTONIO.
 I have no hope
    That he's undrown'd.
 Will you grant with me
    That Ferdinand is drown'd?
  SEBASTIAN.
 He's gone.

  ANTONIO.
 She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
    Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
    Can have no note, unless the sun were post,
    The Man i' th' Moon's too slow, till newborn chins
    Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
    We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
    And by that destiny, to perform an act
    Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
    In yours and my discharge.
 O, that you bore
    The mind that I do! What a sleep were this
    For your advancement! Do you understand me?
  SEBASTIAN.
                  [They talk apart]  

          Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, with music and song

  ARIEL.
 Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
    Like bulls, or rather lions; did't not wake you?
    It struck mine ear most terribly.

  ALONSO.
 Heard you this, Gonzalo?
  GONZALO.
 Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
    And that a strange one too, which did awake me;
    I shak'd you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open'd,
    I saw their weapons drawn-there was a noise,
    That's verily.
 Heavens keep him from these beasts!
    For he is, sure, i' th' island.
  
  ALONSO.
 Lead away.


                         Enter TRINCULO  

    Lo, now, lo!
    Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
    For bringing wood in slowly.
 I'll fall flat;
    Perchance he will not mind me.
 There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.

                                                        [Drinks]
  CALIBAN.
 The spirit torments me.
 He shall taste of my bottle; if he have never
    drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit.
 Open your
    mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and
    that soundly; you cannot tell who's your friend.
 Open
    your chaps again.
 Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
    His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his
    friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and
    to detract.

  TRINCULO.
 Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
    speak to me; for I am Trinculo-be not afeard-thy good
    friend Trinculo.
 Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
    constant.

  CALIBAN.

  STEPHANO.
  [Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book.
 Though
    thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a
    goose.

  TRINCULO.
 I will
    furnish it anon with new contents.
 I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
    and will kiss thy foot.
 I prithee be my god.

  TRINCULO.
 Here, bear my bottle.
  [Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell,
    farewell!
  TRINCULO.
 I must remove
    Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
    Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress
    Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
    Had never like executor.

  
        Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen

  MIRANDA.

  FERDINAND.
 How features are abroad,
    I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
    The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
    Any companion in the world but you;
    Nor can imagination form a shape,
    Besides yourself, to like of.

  FERDINAND.
  [Aside]  Fair encounter
    Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
    On that which breeds between 'em!
  FERDINAND.
 Hence, bashful cunning!
    And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
    I am your wife, if you will marry me;
    If not, I'll die your maid.
 My mistress, dearest;
    And I thus humble ever.
 Here's my hand.
 And now farewell
    Till half an hour hence.
 Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They
    say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of
    them; if th' other two be brain'd like us, the state
    totters.

  STEPHANO.
 By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
    monster, or my standard.
 Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

  CALIBAN.

  TRINCULO.
 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such
    a natural!
  CALIBAN.
  
  CALIBAN.
 Marry will I; kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
    and so shall Trinculo.

  CALIBAN.

  CALIBAN.
 Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt
    the monster one word further and, by this hand, I'll turn
    my mercy out o' doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.

  TRINCULO.

  STEPHANO.
  [Beats him]  As you like
    this, give me the lie another time.
 Now, forward with your tale.
 Burn but his books.

  STEPHANO.
 Excellent.

    Wilt thou destroy him then?
  STEPHANO.
 Ay, on mine honour.
 This will I tell my master.
 Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.
 At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
    reason.
 That's not the tune.
 If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy  
    likeness; if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
 O, forgive me my sins!
  STEPHANO.
 No, monster, not I.
 Be not afeard.
 This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I
    shall have my music for nothing.

  STEPHANO.
 Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.

  ALONSO.
 Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
    Who am myself attach'd with weariness
    To th' dulling of my spirits; sit down and rest.
 What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
  GONZALO.
 Marvellous sweet music!
  ALONSO.
 Now I will believe
    That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
    There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
    At this hour reigning-there.

  GONZALO.
  
  FRANCISCO.

    Will't please you taste of what is here?
  ALONSO.

  GONZALO.

  ALONSO.


       Thunder and lightning.
 You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
    That hath to instrument this lower world
    And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
    Hath caus'd to belch up you; and on this island
    Where man doth not inhabit-you 'mongst men
    Being most unfit to live.
 If you could hurt,
    Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
    And will not be uplifted.


        He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter
        the SHAPES again, and dance, with mocks and mows,
                and carrying out the table

  PROSPERO.
  
    Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
    In what thou hadst to say; so, with good life
    And observation strange, my meaner ministers
    Their several kinds have done.

ACT IV.

  FERDINAND.

  FERDINAND.

    What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
  
                           Enter ARIEL

  ARIEL.
 What would my potent master? Here I am.
 Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
    And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,  
    Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,
    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,
    Where thou thyself dost air-the Queen o' th' sky,
    Whose wat'ry arch and messenger am I,
    Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    To come and sport.
 Hail, many-coloured messenger, that ne'er
    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
    Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flow'rs
    Diffusest honey drops, refreshing show'rs;
    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown  
    My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
    Rich scarf to my proud earth-why hath thy Queen
    Summon'd me hither to this short-grass'd green?
  IRIS.

  CERES.
  
  FERDINAND.
 This is a most majestic vision, and
    Harmonious charmingly.
 May I be bold
    To think these spirits?
  PROSPERO.

  IRIS.
  [To the SPIRITS]  Well done; avoid; no
    more!  
  FERDINAND.

  PROSPERO.
 I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
    So full of valour that they smote the air
    For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
    For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
    Towards their project.

  PROSPERO.
 This was well done, my bird.

  ARIEL.
                                        Exit
  PROSPERO.

  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.
  
  TRINCULO.
 That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is
    your harmless fairy, monster.
 I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er
    ears for my labour.
 I do begin to have bloody
    thoughts.
 O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
    Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
  CALIBAN.
 Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
 O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a
    frippery.
 Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll  
    have that gown.

  TRINCULO.

  TRINCULO.
 Enter divers SPIRITS, in
             shape of dogs and hounds, bunting them about;
                   PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on

  PROSPERO.

ACT V.
 Confin'd together
    In the same fashion as you gave in charge;
    Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
    In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
    They cannot budge till your release.

  PROSPERO.
 Mine would, sir, were I human.

  PROSPERO.
 Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
    groves;
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war.
 To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar.
 The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason.
 Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.

    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian.
 Ariel,  
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL
    I will discase me, and myself present
    As I was sometime Milan.
 Quickly, spirit
    Thou shalt ere long be free.

    Merrily, merrily shall I live now
    Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

    To the King's ship, invisible as thou art;
    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
    Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain  
    Being awake, enforce them to this place;
    And presently, I prithee.
 All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement,
    Inhabits here.
  
    Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
    Thou pardon me my wrongs.
 Welcome, my friends all!
    [Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]  But you, my brace of
      lords, were I so minded,
    I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you,
    And justify you traitors; at this time
    I will tell no tales.

  SEBASTIAN.

    For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
    Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive  
    Thy rankest fault-all of them; and require
    My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know
    Thou must restore.
 A daughter!
    O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
    The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish
    Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
    Where my son lies.
 Welcome, sir;
    This cell's my court; here have I few attendants,  
    And subjects none abroad; pray you, look in.
 Sweet lord, you play me false.

  FERDINAND.

  MIRANDA.

  ALONSO.
 Amen!

           Re-enter ARIEL, with the MASTER and BOATSWAIN
                     amazedly following

    O look, sir; look, sir! Here is more of us!
    I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
    This fellow could not drown.
 The best news is that we have safely found
    Our King and company; the next, our ship-
    Which but three glasses since we gave out split-
    Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg'd, as when  
    We first put out to sea.
 These are not natural events; they strengthen
    From strange to stranger.
 Say, how came you hither?
  BOATSWAIN.
  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come
    hither, spirit;
    Set Caliban and his companions free;
    Untie the spell.
 Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man
    take care for himself; for all is but fortune.

  CALIBAN.
 Ha, ha!
    What things are these, my lord Antonio?
    Will money buy'em?
  ANTONIO.
 Very like; one of them
    Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.
 Two of these fellows you
    Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
    Acknowledge mine.
 I
    shall not fear fly-blowing.
  
  PROSPERO.

  PROSPERO.
 I'll deliver all;
    And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
    And sail so expeditious that shall catch
    Your royal fleet far off.

                                                          Exeunt



EPILOGUE
                             EPILOGUE
                        Spoken by PROSPERO

          Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
          And what strength I have's mine own,
          Which is most faint.
 Now 'tis true,
          I must be here confin'd by you,
          Or sent to Naples.

  JEWELLER.
 But for that-
  POET.
 When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
    It stains the glory in that happy verse
    Which aptly sings the good.
 A thing slipp'd idly from me.
 The fire i' th' flint
    Shows not till it be struck: our gentle flame
    Provokes itself, and like the current flies
    Each bound it chafes.
 When comes your book forth?
  POET.

    Let's see your piece.
 So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.

    Here is a touch; is't good?
  POET.
 Look, moe!
  POET.

    I have in this rough work shap'd out a man
    Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug  
    With amplest entertainment.
 How shall I understand you?
  POET.
 His large fortune,
    Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,
    Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
    All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
    To Apemantus, that few things loves better
    Than to abhor himself; even he drops down
    The knee before him, and returns in peace
    Most rich in Timon's nod.

  PAINTER.

  PAINTER.

    I am not of that feather to shake of
    My friend when he must need me.
 Fare you well.

  TIMON.
 Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.

  TIMON.
 This man of thine
    Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,  
    Join with me to forbid him her resort;
    Myself have spoke in vain.

    His honesty rewards him in itself;
    It must not bear my daughter.

  TIMON.
 Three talents on the present; in future, all.

  TIMON.
 My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
 A piece of painting, which I do beseech
    Your lordship to accept.
 Painting is welcome.

  JEWELLER.


                      Enter APEMANTUS  

  MERCHANT.
 Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
    When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
 You know me, Apemantus?
  APEMANTUS.

  TIMON.

  TIMON.

  TIMON.
 How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?
  APEMANTUS.
 The best, for the innocence.

  PAINTER.

  APEMANTUS.
 Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?
  TIMON.
 No; I eat not lords.
 That's a lascivious apprehension.
 Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man
    a doit.

  TIMON.
 Thou liest.
 Art not one?
  APEMANTUS.

  POET.
 What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
  APEMANTUS.
 E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.
  
  APEMANTUS.

  ALCIBIADES.
 No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests
    to thy friend.

  APEMANTUS.
 I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' th' ass.

    If our betters play at that game, we must not dare  
    To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair.
 Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
    To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
    Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
    But where there is true friendship there needs none.

  APEMANTUS.

    They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever
    angry.
 If
    I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals.

  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.

           Amen.
 Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that
    then thou mightst kill 'em, and bid me to 'em.
 How had you been
    my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from
    thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
    more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own
    behalf; and thus far I confirm you.
 Why, I have
    often wish'd myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you.
 To forget their
    faults, I drink to you.

  APEMANTUS.

  SECOND LORD.

  APEMANTUS.
 What means that trump?

                        Enter a SERVANT

    How now?
  SERVANT.
 I pray let them be admitted.
                        Exit CUPID
  FIRST LORD.
 My lord, you take us even at the best.
 The little casket bring me hither.
 I am so far already in your gifts-
  ALL.
                   Exit SERVANT
  FLAVIUS.
 Near! Why then, another time I'll hear thee.

  FLAVIUS.
 Let the presents
    Be worthily entertain'd.
                        Exit SERVANT
  FLAVIUS.
 He is so kind that he now
    Pays interest for't; his land's put to their books.

    I bleed inwardly for my lord.
 O, he's the very soul of bounty!
  TIMON.
 O, I beseech you pardon me, my lord, in that.
  
  FIRST LORD.
 We are so virtuously bound-
  TIMON.
 And so am I to you.

                              Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
  APEMANTUS.
 Thou giv'st so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give
    away thyself in paper shortly.
 What needs these feasts, pomps,  
    and vain-glories?
  TIMON.
 Thou wilt not hear me now: thou shalt not then.
 I'll
    lock thy heaven from thee.

    O that men's ears should be
    To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!                   Exit

ACT II.
 SCENE I.
 To Varro and to Isidore
    He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
    Which makes it five and twenty.
 No porter at his gate,
    But rather one that smiles and still invites
    All that pass by.
 I will, sir.

    What shall be done? He will not hear till feel.
 Would we were all discharg'd!  
  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 I fear it.

  TIMON.
 Go to my steward.

  CAPHIS.
 Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
    To the succession of new days this month.

    My master is awak'd by great occasion
    To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
    That with your other noble parts you'll suit
    In giving him his right.
 Mine honest friend,
    I prithee but repair to me next morning.
 Nay, good my lord-  
  TIMON.
 One Varro's servant, my good lord-
  ISIDORE'S SERVANT.
 'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and
    past.

    I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
    I'll wait upon you instantly.
 Pray you,
    How goes the world that I am thus encount'red
    With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds
    And the detention of long-since-due debts,
    Against my honour?
  FLAVIUS.
  
    Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
    That I may make his lordship understand
    Wherefore you are not paid.
 Do so, my friends.
                              Exit
  FLAVIUS.
                                  Exit

                      Enter APEMANTUS and FOOL

  CAPHIS.

  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 How dost, fool?
  APEMANTUS.
 Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
  VARRO'S SERVANT.
  
  CAPHIS.
 Where's the fool now?
  APEMANTUS.
 He last ask'd the question.
 Why?
  APEMANTUS.
 Speak to 'em, fool.
 How do you, gentlemen?
  ALL SERVANTS.
 Gramercies, good fool.
 Canst not read?
  PAGE.
 This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades.
 Thou wast whelp'd a dog, and thou shalt famish dog's death.

  APEMANTUS.

  FOOL.
 He is very often like a knight; and, generally,
    in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to
    thirteen, this spirit walks in.

  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 Thou art not altogether a fool.

                                                 Exeunt SERVANTS
  TIMON.
 Go to;
    Perchance some single vantages you took
    When my indisposition put you back,
    And that unaptness made your minister
    Thus to excuse yourself.
 Let all my land be sold.
 To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
 You tell me true.
 So the gods bless me,
    When all our offices have been oppress'd
    With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
    With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
    Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
    I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock
    And set mine eyes at flow.
 Prithee no more.

  TIMON.
 Is't true? Can't be?
  FLAVIUS.

    Their blood is cak'd, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
    'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
    And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
    Is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy.

 Why,
    this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to-night-
    Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome,
    sir.
 [Exit SERVANT] And how does that
    honourable, complete, freehearted gentleman of Athens, thy very
    bountiful good lord and master?
  FLAMINIUS.
 I am right glad that his health is well, sir.
 And what
    hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
  FLAMINIUS.
 Every man has his fault, and honesty is his.
 I ha'
    told him on't, but I could ne'er get him from't.


                    Re-enter SERVANT, with wine

  SERVANT.
 Please your lordship, here is the wine.

Enter Lucius, with three STRANGERS

  LUCIUS.
 Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an
    honourable gentleman.
 How?
  SECOND STRANGER.


                             Enter SERVILIUS

  SERVILIUS.
- My honour'd lord!

 But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.

  LUCIUS.

  LUCIUS.

                                                  Exit SERVILIUS  
    True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
    And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
 Do you observe this, Hostilius?
  SECOND STRANGER.
 Ay, too well.

  FIRST STRANGER.
 Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same
      piece
    Is every flatterer's spirit.

    And does he think so backwardly of me now
    That I'll requite it last? No;
    So it may prove an argument of laughter
    To th' rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.
 Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain.
 The devil
    knew not what he did when he made man politic- he cross'd himself
    by't; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man
    will set him clear.

    Of such a nature is his politic love.
 Now his friends are dead,  
    Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
    Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
    Now to guard sure their master.

  TITUS.


                          Enter PHILOTUS

  LUCIUS' SERVANT.
 Labouring for nine.
 I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.

  PHILOTUS.

  TITUS.
  
  HORTENSIUS.


                           Enter FLAMINIUS

  TITUS.
 No, indeed, he is not.
 I need not tell him that; he knows you are to diligent.

  TITUS.
 How! What does his cashier'd worship mutter?
  SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT.
 O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
 If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other
    hour, I should derive much from't; for take't of my soul, my lord
    leans wondrously to discontent.
 His comfortable temper has
    forsook him; he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.

  LUCIUS' SERVANT.
 [Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!

           Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following

  TIMON.

  LUCIUS' SERVANT.

  PHILOTUS.
 Knock me down with 'em; cleave me to the girdle.
 Mine, fifty talents.
 What yours? and yours?
  FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT.
 My lord-
  SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT.
 Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!      Exit
  HORTENSIUS.
 Here, my lord.

    I'll once more feast the rascals.

  FLAVIUS.
 O my lord,
    You only speak from your distracted soul;
    There is not so much left to furnish out
    A moderate table.

The Senate House

Enter three SENATORS at one door, ALCIBIADES meeting them, with attendants

  FIRST SENATOR.
 Most true; the law shall bruise him.
 I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
    For pity is the virtue of the law,
    And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
 My lords, then, under favour, pardon me
    If I speak like a captain:
    Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
    And not endure all threats? Sleep upon't,
    And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
    Without repugnancy? If there be
    Such valour in the bearing, what make we
    Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant,
    That stay at home, if bearing carry it;
    And the ass more captain than the lion; the fellow
    Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
    If wisdom be in suffering.

    Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
    To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;  
    But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.

    To be in anger is impiety;
    But who is man that is not angry?
    Weigh but the crime with this.

  ALCIBIADES.
 In vain! His service done
    At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
    Were a sufficient briber for his life.

  FIRST SENATOR.

    If there were no foes, that were enough
    To overcome him.
 Hard fate! He might have died in war.
 Urge it no more
    On height of our displeasure.

    'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
    Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
 Enter divers LORDS,
friends of TIMON, at several doors

  FIRST LORD.
 I also wish it to you.

  FIRST LORD.

  SECOND LORD.
 I am sorry, when he
    sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
 What of you?
  SECOND LORD.


                   Enter TIMON and attendants

  TIMON.
 With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?
  FIRST LORD.

  TIMON.
 O sir, let it not trouble you.
  
  SECOND LORD.
 Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
  SECOND LORD.
 [The banquet
    brought in] Come, bring in all together.
 Royal cheer, I warrant you.

  THIRD LORD.
 Alcibiades banish'd!
  THIRD LORD.
 This is the old man still.
 Lend to each man enough,
    that one need not lend to another; for were your god-heads to
    borrow of men, men would forsake the gods.
 Make the meat be
    beloved more than the man that gives it.
 If there sit twelve women
    at the table, let a dozen of them be- as they are.


    Uncover, dogs, and lap.
        [The dishes are uncovered and
                                  seen to he full of warm water]
  SOME SPEAK.

  TIMON.
 This is Timon's last;
    Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
    Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
                             [Throwing the water in their faces]
    Your reeking villainy.

    Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
 Push! Did you see my cap?
  FOURTH LORD.
 I have lost my gown.

  FIRST LORD.
 Did you see my cap?
  SECOND LORD.
 Here 'tis.
 Let's make no stay.
 Lord Timon's mad.

          Exit




SCENE III.
 Before TIMON'S cave

Enter TIMON in the woods

  TIMON.
 Not nature,
    To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune
    But by contempt of nature.
 The learned pate  
    Ducks to the golden fool.

                                                       [Digging]
    Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
    With thy most operant poison.
 A beast, as thou art.

  ALCIBIADES.
 Follow thy drum;
    With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules.

    Religious canons, civil laws, are cruel;
    Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
    Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
    For all her cherubin look.
 I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
    To thine own lips again.
 How came the noble Timon to this change?
  TIMON.

    But then renew I could not, like the moon;
    There were no suns to borrow of.
 None, but to
    Maintain my opinion.
 What is it, Timon?
  TIMON.
 If thou wilt not
    promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art man! If thou dost
    perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!
  ALCIBIADES.
 I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.

  TIMON.
 As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
 Yes.
 Season the slaves
    For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheek'd youth  
    To the tub-fast and the diet.

  TIMON.
 How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
    I had rather be alone.

  TIMON.

  ALCIBIADES.
 War'st thou 'gainst Athens?
  ALCIBIADES.

  TIMON.
 Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!
  PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA.
 Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
    And to make whores a bawd.
 Be whores still;
    And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you-  
    Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
    Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
    And be no turncoats.
 Hoar the flamen,
    That scolds against the quality of flesh
    And not believes himself.
 Farewell, Timon;
    If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

  ALCIBIADES.
 Yes, thou spok'st well of me.
 Men daily find it.
 Get thee away, and take
    Thy beagles with thee.
 I was directed hither.
 Men report
    Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.
 Thou wast told thus;
    Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bade welcome,
    To knaves and all approachers.

    O, thou shalt find-
  TIMON.
  
  APEMANTUS.

  TIMON.
 Why dost thou seek me out?
  APEMANTUS.
 What, a knave too?
  APEMANTUS.
 If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
    To castigate thy pride, 'twere well; but thou
    Dost it enforcedly.
  
    Thy nature did commence in sufferance; time
    Hath made thee hard in't.

    If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
    Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
 Art thou proud yet?
  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.
 If thou wilt,
    Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
 Where my stomach.
 Would poison were obedient, and knew my mind!
  APEMANTUS.
 On what I hate I feed not.
 What man didst thou ever know unthrift
    that was beloved after his means?
  TIMON.
 Who, without those means thou talk'st of, didst thou ever
    know belov'd?
  APEMANTUS.
 Myself.
 Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
 All thy safety
    were remotion, and thy defence absence.
 All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
 Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
    Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
    I swoon to see thee.
 Beast!
  TIMON.
 Would 'twere so!
    But not till I am dead.
 More
    things like men? Eat, Timon, and abhor them.

  THIRD BANDIT.

  FIRST BANDIT.
 Save thee, Timon!
  TIMON.

  TIMON.

    Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
    Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
    The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips;
    The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush
    Lays her full mess before you.

  TIMON.
 Go, suck the subtle blood o' th' grape
    Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
    And so scape hanging.
 Take wealth and lives together;
    Do villainy, do, since you protest to do't,
    Like workmen.
 Love not yourselves; away,
    Rob one another.

  FIRST BANDIT.
 O you gods!
    Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord?
    Full of decay and failing? O monument
    And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
    What an alteration of honour
    Has desp'rate want made!
    What viler thing upon the earth than friends,
    Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
    How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
    When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
    Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
    Those that would mischief me than those that do!
    Has caught me in his eye; I will present
    My honest grief unto him, and as my lord
    Still serve him with my life.
 Have you forgot me, sir?
  TIMON.

  FLAVIUS.

  FLAVIUS.
 I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
    T' accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts
    To entertain me as your steward still.
 Had I a steward
    So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
    It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.

    Let me behold thy face.

    Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,  
    You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
    One honest man- mistake me not, but one;
    No more, I pray- and he's a steward.
 But all, save thee,
    I fell with curses.
 The gods, out of my misery,
    Have sent thee treasure.
 If thou hat'st curses,
    Stay not; fly whilst thou art blest and free.

                                                Exeunt severally

SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC.

  POET.
 Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will
    promise him an excellent piece.
 I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that's coming
    toward him.

  POET.

  TIMON.
 He and myself
    Have travail'd in the great show'r of your gifts,
    And sweetly felt it.
 Ay, you are honest men.
 Th'art indeed the best;
    Thou counterfeit'st most lively.

  POET.
 Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
    Rid me these villains from your companies.
 You that way, and you this- but two in company;
    Each man apart, all single and alone,
    Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
 At all times alike
    Men are not still the same; 'twas time and griefs
    That fram'd him thus.
 Time, with his fairer hand,
    Offering the fortunes of his former days,  
    The former man may make him.

    Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
    Look out, and speak to friends.
 Th' Athenians
    By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee.


                   Enter TIMON out of his cave

  TIMON.

  FIRST SENATOR.

  TIMON.
 But if he sack fair Athens,
    And take our goodly aged men by th' beards,
    Giving our holy virgins to the stain
    Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,  
    Then let him know- and tell him Timon speaks it
    In pity of our aged and our youth-
    I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,
    And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
    While you have throats to answer.
 So I leave you
    To the protection of the prosperous gods,
    As thieves to keepers.

  TIMON.
 But yet I love my country, and am not
    One that rejoices in the common wreck,  
    As common bruit doth put it.

  TIMON.
 Commend me to them,
    And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
    Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
    Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
    That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
    In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them-
    I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

  TIMON.

    Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
    What is amiss, plague and infection mend!
    Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
    Sun, hide thy beams.
 Our hope in him is dead.
 Let us return
    And strain what other means is left unto us
    In our dear peril.
 I have spoke the least.

    Who's here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?
    Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span.

    Some beast rear'd this; here does not live a man.

    Dead, sure; and this his grave.
 What's on this tomb
    I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax.

    Our captain hath in every figure skill,
    An ag'd interpreter, though young in days;
    Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
    Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.


       Sound a parley.
 Now the time is flush,
    When crouching marrow, in the bearer strong,
    Cries of itself 'No more!' Now breathless wrong
    Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
    And pursy insolence shall break his wind
    With fear and horrid flight.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 These walls of ours
    Were not erected by their hands from whom
    You have receiv'd your griefs; nor are they such
    That these great tow'rs, trophies, and schools, should fall
    For private faults in them.
 Then there's my glove;
    Descend, and open your uncharged ports.

  BOTH.

  ALCIBIADES.
 Descend, and keep your words.

    Pass by, and curse thy fill; but pass, and stay not here thy
      gait.

    Let our drums strike.

    I am his first born son that was the last
    That ware the imperial diadem of Rome;
    Then let my father's honours live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.

    Open the gates and let me in.


        Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter MARTIUS
        and MUTIUS, two of TITUS' sons; and then two men
        bearing a coffin covered with black; then LUCIUS
        and QUINTUS, two other sons; then TITUS ANDRONICUS;
        and then TAMORA the Queen of Goths, with her three
        sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the
        Moor, and others,  as many as can be.
 Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
    Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
    Returns with precious lading to the bay  
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
    To re-salute his country with his tears,
    Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
 Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
    Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,
    That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.

    Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.

    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
 Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.

    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must
    T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.

    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
 See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
    Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.

    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

                       Enter LAVINIA

  LAVINIA.
 In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
    My noble lord and father, live in fame!
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
    I render for my brethren's obsequies;
    And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
    Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
 Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
    The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
    Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
    And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!

          Enter, above, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and TRIBUNES;
          re-enter SATURNINUS, BASSIANUS, and attendants

  MARCUS.
 And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive and you that sleep in fame.

    Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all
    That in your country's service drew your swords;
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
    That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
    And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
  
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
    Send thee by me, their Tribune and their trust,
    This par]iament of white and spotless hue;
    And name thee in election for the empire
    With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.
 A better head her glorious body fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.

  MARCUS.
 Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.

  SATURNINUS.
 Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
  TITUS.
 Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But honour thee, and will do till I die.

    Then, if you will elect by my advice,
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'
  MARCUS.

  SATURNINUS.
 Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.

    How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
    Rome shall record; and when I do forget
    The least of these unspeakable deserts,  
    Romans, forget your fealty to me.

  TITUS.

    Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
  LAVINIA.

    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.

    Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
 Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
 Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal
    To do myself this reason and this right.
 Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
    Treason, my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd!
  SATURNINUS.
 By him that justly may
    Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.

  MUTIUS.
 During the fray, exeunt SATURNINUS,
                            TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and AARON

                      Re-enter Lucius

  LUCIUS.

  TITUS.
  
    I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;
    Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
    Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
 These words are razors to my wounded heart.
 Ascend, fair Queen, Pantheon.

  TITUS, when wert thou wont to walk alone,  
    Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?

                      Re-enter MARCUS,
        and TITUS' SONS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

  MARCUS.
 But let us give him burial, as becomes;
    Give Mutius burial with our bretheren.
 My lord, this is impiety in you.
 And shall, or him we will accompany.

  TITUS.
 Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
 Father, and in that name doth nature speak-
  TITUS.
 Renowned Titus, more than half my soul-
  LUCIUS.
 Dear father, soul and substance of us all-  
  MARCUS.

  TITUS.
 Re-enter the EMPEROR, TAMORA
        and her two SONS, with the MOOR, at one door;
    at the other door, BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, with others

  SATURNINUS.
 And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
    Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.

  SATURNINUS.

    [Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be rul'd by me,
      be won at last;
    Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.
  
    For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
    My word and promise to the Emperor
    That you will be more mild and tractable.

    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
    You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.
 Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    I do remit these young men's heinous faults.

    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
 Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.

    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
    So Tamora.
  
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made emperess.
 Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge
    And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
    And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.

  AARON.
 Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
    Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,
    Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
    Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
    Till you know better how to handle it.

  AARON.

  AARON.
 For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
 My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad
    When everything does make a gleeful boast?
    The birds chant melody on every bush;
    The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun;  
    The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
    And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground;
    Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
    And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
    Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,
    Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise;
    And- after conflict such as was suppos'd
    The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed,
    When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-
    We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
    Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,
    Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
    Be unto us as is a nurse's song
    Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
 Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
    Saturn is dominator over mine.

    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
    Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.

    Now question me no more; we are espied.


                Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA
  
  TAMORA.
 Saucy controller of my private steps!
    Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had,
    Thy temples should be planted presently
    With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
    Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
    Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  LAVINIA.

    Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!  
    'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
 The King my brother shall have notice of this.

  LAVINIA.
 How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
    Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?
  TAMORA.

                                               [Stabs BASSIANUS]
  CHIRON.
 Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,
    Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
 Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her;
    First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.

  TAMORA.
 But when ye have the honey we desire,
    Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
 I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.

    Yet have I heard- O, could I find it now!-
    The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure
    To have his princely paws par'd all away.

  TAMORA.
 Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.

  MARTIUS.

    Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
  MARTIUS.
 Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
    From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?
  QUINTUS.

  QUINTUS.

  MARTIUS.

  QUINTUS.

    Thou canst not come to me- I come to thee.
 Along with me! I'll see what hole is here,
    And what he is that now is leapt into it.

    Say, who art thou that lately didst descend
    Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
  MARTIUS.
  
  SATURNINUS.
 My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
    He and his lady both are at the lodge
    Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
    'Tis not an hour since I left them there.

  MARTIUS.
 We know not where you left them all alive;
    But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
 Where is thy brother Bassianus?
  SATURNINUS.

    Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
    That should have murdered Bassianus here.

  TAMORA.
 If it be prov'd! You see it is apparent.
 Andronicus himself did take it up.
 I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;
    For, by my fathers' reverend tomb, I vow
    They shall be ready at your Highness' will
    To answer their suspicion with their lives.

  SATURNINUS.

    Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers;
    Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain;
    For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
    That end upon them should be executed.

  TAMORA.

    Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
     Exeunt




SCENE IV.

Another part of the forest

Enter the Empress' sons, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, with LAVINIA,
her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out, and ravish'd

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.

  CHIRON.
 Enter MARCUS, from hunting

  MARCUS.
 Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?  
    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece.
  
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

Rome.

  LUCIUS.
 O noble father, you lament in vain;
    The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by,
    And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
  
  TITUS.
 My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

                                                         [Rises]
    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?  
  LUCIUS.
 Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
    Or if not so, thy noble heart to break.

  TITUS.
 This was thy daughter.
 Ay me! this object kills me.

    Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too,
    For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
    And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,
    And they have serv'd me to effectless use.

    Now all the service I require of them
    Is that the one will help to cut the other.

  LUCIUS.
 O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS.
 It was my dear, and he that wounded her
    Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead;
    For now I stand as one upon a rock,
    Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
    Expecting ever when some envious surge
    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.

  TITUS.
 Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.

    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

                   Enter AARON the Moor

  AARON.
 O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
    Did ever raven sing so like a lark
    That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
    With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand.

    Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?  
  LUCIUS.
 My hand will serve the turn,
    My youth can better spare my blood than you,
    And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
 By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS.

  TITUS.
 Then I'll go fetch an axe.

    [Aside]  Their heads I mean.
 O brother, speak with possibility,
    And do not break into these deep extremes.

  TITUS.

    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.

    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
             Exit
  MARCUS.
 Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.

    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
  
    Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
    O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
    But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
    But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
 So so, now sit; and look you eat no more
    Than will preserve just so much strength in us
    As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
 Hark, Marcus, what she says-
    I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;  
    She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
    Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks.

  BOY.
 Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
    Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.

  TITUS.

    Give me thy knife, I will insult on him,
    Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
    Come hither purposely to poison me.
 Come, take away.

Rome.

  BOY.

  MARCUS.
-
    But thou art deeper read and better skill'd;
    Come and take choice of all my library,  
    And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
 I think she means that there were more than one
    Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was,
    Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
 Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
 O, why should nature build so foul a den,
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
  TITUS.

    Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
    That we may know the traitors and the truth!
                               [She takes the staff in her mouth
                          and guides it with stumps, and writes]
    O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
  TITUS.

  TITUS.
 I say, my lord, that if I were a man
    Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
    For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
 Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
    For his ungrateful country done the like.

    Come, come; thou'lt do my message, wilt thou not?
  BOY.
 Marcus, look to my house.
- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,  
    You may be armed and appointed well.

    And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.

    But were our witty Empress well afoot,
    She would applaud Andronicus' conceit.
 A charitable wish and full of love.

  AARON.
 Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
    For our beloved mother in her pains.
 Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
  CHIRON.
 Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.

  AARON.
 Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE.
 Why, then she is the devil's dam;
    A joyful issue.
 Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
    Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure.

  CHIRON.

  AARON.

    Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
    Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend!
  CHIRON.
 What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
    Do execution on my flesh and blood.

  AARON.

    What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
    Ye white-lim'd walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
    Coal-black is better than another hue
    In that it scorns to bear another hue;
    For all the water in the ocean
    Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
    Although she lave them hourly in the flood.

    Tell the Empress from me I am of age
    To keep mine own- excuse it how she can.
 Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?  
  AARON.
 My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
    The vigour and the picture of my youth.

    This before all the world do I prefer;
    This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
    Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS.

    Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.

    But say, again, how many saw the child?
  NURSE.

  AARON.
 What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON.

    Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours-
    A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.

    This done, see that you take no longer days,
    But send the midwife presently to me.
 Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
    With secrets.
 For this care of Tamora,
    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.


         Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE

  AARON.

    Go get you gone; and pray be careful all,
    And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.
 O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
    To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
  PUBLIUS.

    Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.

    I'll dive into the burning lake below
    And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
 You are a good archer, Marcus.

                                      [He gives them the arrows]
    'Ad Jovem' that's for you; here 'Ad Apollinem.

    To it, boy.
 Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
    We will afflict the Emperor in his pride.

  TITUS.
  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
    Good boy, in Virgo's lap! Give it Pallas.
 My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
    Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
 Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  CLOWN.

  TITUS.
 From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there.

  TITUS.
 Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
    grace?
  CLOWN.

    Hold, hold! Meanwhile here's money for thy charges.

    Give me pen and ink.

  TITUS.

    Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
    For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant.
 God be with you, sir; I will.

  TITUS.
     Exeunt




SCENE IV.

Rome.
  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.

  TAMORA.
 'Tis he.
                                          [Exit guarded]
  SATURNINUS.
 Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
    Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
 Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?  
    These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
    As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.
 King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
    Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
    The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
    And is not careful what they mean thereby,
    Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
    He can at pleasure stint their melody;
    Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.
 But he will not entreat his son for us.
 Then go successantly, and plead to him.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.

  FIRST GOTH.

    But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

     Enter a GOTH, leading AARON with his CHILD in his arms

  SECOND GOTH.

  LUCIUS.
 Too like the sire for ever being good.

  AARON.
 Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
 Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;  
    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
  AARON.

  LUCIUS.
 O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  AARON.

    'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,
    And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou sawest.
 O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
  AARON.
 O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
  AARON.
'
    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
    As willingly as one would kill a fly;
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
 Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
  

                       Enter AEMILIUS

  GOTH.
 Let him come near.


         They knock and TITUS opens his study door, above

  TITUS.
 Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
 No, not a word.

  TAMORA.
 If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.

  TITUS.

    Is not thy coming for my other hand?
  TAMORA.
 Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
    To be a torment to mine enemies?
  TAMORA.
 I am; therefore come down and welcome me.

    Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
    To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
    And find out murderers in their guilty caves;
    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,  
    I will dismount, and by thy waggon wheel
    Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
    Until his very downfall in the sea.

    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
 Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.

    Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  
    But welcome as you are.
 Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
    And I am sent to be reveng'd on him.

  TITUS.

    Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court
    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
    Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
    For up and down she doth resemble thee.

    What says Andronicus to this device?
  TITUS.

    This do thou for my love; and so let him,
    As he regards his aged father's life.
 This will I do, and soon return again.
            Exit
  TAMORA.

  TITUS.
  [Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? Will you abide
      with him,
    Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
    How I have govern'd our determin'd jest?
    Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
    And tarry with him till I turn again.
  [Aside]  I knew them all, though they suppos'd me mad,
    And will o'er reach them in their own devices,
    A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.

  TAMORA.

                                                     Exit TAMORA
  CHIRON.
 Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
  TITUS.


          Enter PUBLIUS, CAIUS, and VALENTINE

  PUBLIUS.

  TITUS.
 Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
 And therefore do we what we are commanded.

    Now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
    And see them ready against their mother comes.


            Sound trumpets.
 What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
  LUCIUS.
 Because I would be sure to have all well
    To entertain your Highness and your Empress.
 An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.

    My lord the Emperor, resolve me this:
    Was it well done of rash Virginius
    To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
    Because she was enforc'd, stain'd, and deflower'd?
  SATURNINUS.
 What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
 Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.

  SATURNINUS.

  TITUS.
 Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
    There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
 You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
    By uproars sever'd, as a flight of fowl
    Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts?
    O, let me teach you how to knit again
    This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
    And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
    Do shameful execution on herself.

    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,  
    Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
    Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.

    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
    That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood
    And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
    Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.

  ALL.
          Exeunt some
              attendants.

    Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near
    To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.

    O, were the sum of these that I should pay  
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
  LUCIUS.
 Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us
    To melt in showers.
 How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
    When they were living, warm'd themselves on thine!
    O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss!
    Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
    Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.
 Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
    I should repent the evils I have done;
    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
    Would I perform, if I might have my will.

    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.

  LUCIUS.

 SCENE 1.
 Before PRIAM'S palace

Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS

  TROILUS.

    Why should I war without the walls of Troy
    That find such cruel battle here within?
    Each Troyan that is master of his heart,
    Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none!
  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.
 Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
 Still have I tarried.
 I  will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit; but-
  TROILUS.
 Thou answer'st 'She is fair'-
    Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-
    Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
    Handlest in thy discourse.

  PANDARUS.
 Faith, I'll not meddle in it.
 Let her be as she is: if
    she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
    mends in her own hands.
 But what care I? I care not an she were a
    blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.
 Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her
    the next time I see her.

  TROILUS.

    But Pandarus-O gods, how do you plague me!
    I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
    And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
    As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.


                Alarum.

  TROILUS.

    He chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;
    And, like as there were husbandry in war,
    Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    And to the field goes he; where every flower
    Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    In Hector's wrath.
 What was his cause of anger?
  ALEXANDER.
 The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
    A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
    They call him Ajax.

  CRESSIDA.
 So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
    legs.
 They say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and
    struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
    kept Hector fasting and waking.
  

                          Enter PANDARUS

  CRESSIDA.
 This morning, uncle.

  PANDARUS.
 True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about  
    him today, I can tell them that.
 What, is he angry too?
  PANDARUS.
 What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
    if you see him?
  CRESSIDA.
 Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.

  CRESSIDA.
 He is not Hector.

  PANDARUS.

  CRESSIDA.
 Nor his qualities.
 Helen herself swore th'
    other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must
    confess- not brown neither-
  CRESSIDA.
 Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.

  CRESSIDA.
 She prais'd his complexion above Paris.

  PANDARUS.
 I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
 Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
  PANDARUS.
 Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.

  PANDARUS.
 But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes.
 Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus'
    chin.

  CRESSIDA.
 That white hair is my father,
    and all the rest are his sons.
 Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.

  PANDARUS.
 And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
    against May.
                                    [Sound a retreat]
  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.
 Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
    most bravely.
 Speak not so loud.
 If he do, the rich shall have more.
 There's a countenance! Is't not a  
    brave man?
  CRESSIDA.
 There be hacks.
 Swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
    it's all one.

  CRESSIDA.
 Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus.
 Mark him; note him.
 Here comes more.


                 Common soldiers pass

  PANDARUS.

    Ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone.
 Crows and daws,
    crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
    Agamemnon and all Greece.

  CRESSIDA.

  PANDARUS.
 Well, well.

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.
 Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
    chiefest of them too.

  CRESSIDA.

    Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,  
    Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

  ULYSSES.
 Agamemnon,
    Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,  
    Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit
    In whom the tempers and the minds of all
    Should be shut up-hear what Ulysses speaks.
 Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,  
    And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    But for these instances:
    The specialty of rule hath been neglected;
    And look how many Grecian tents do stand
    Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.

    When that the general is not like the hive,
    To whom the foragers shall all repair,
    What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
    Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.

    The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,
    Observe degree, priority, and place,
    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
    Office, and custom, in all line of order;
    And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
    In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd
    Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye
    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
    And posts, like the commandment of a king,
    Sans check, to good and bad.
 But when the planets
    In evil mixture to disorder wander,  
    What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,
    What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,
    Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,
    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,
    The unity and married calm of states
    Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak'd,
    Which is the ladder of all high designs,
    The enterprise is sick! How could communities,
    Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,
    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
    The primogenity and due of birth,
    Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
    But by degree, stand in authentic place?
    Take but degree away, untune that string,
    And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts
    In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,
    And make a sop of all this solid globe;
    Strength should be lord of imbecility,
    And the rude son should strike his father dead;  
    Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong-
    Between whose endless jar justice resides-
    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
'
    And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit
    And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
    Shake in and out the rivet.
 Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
    Makes many Thetis' sons.
                                 [Tucket]
  AGAMEMNON.

  MENELAUS.
 Ay;
    I ask, that I might waken reverence,
    And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
    Modest as Morning when she coldly eyes
    The youthful Phoebus.
 Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
    As bending angels; that's their fame in peace.
 Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
  AENEAS.

    Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,
    Shall make it good or do his best to do it:
    He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,
    Than ever Greek did couple in his arms;
    And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
    Mid-way between your tents and walls of Troy
    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.

    If any come, Hector shall honour him;
    If none, he'll say in Troy, when he retires,
    The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    The splinter of a lance.
 But we are soldiers;
    And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
    That means not, hath not, or is not in love.
 He is old now;
    But if there be not in our Grecian mould
    One noble man that hath one spark of fire
    To answer for his love, tell him from me
    I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,
    And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
    And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady
    Was fairer than his grandame, and as chaste
    As may be in the world.
 Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!
  ULYSSES.
 Nestor!
  NESTOR.
 What says Ulysses?
  ULYSSES.
 I have a young conception in my brain;
    Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
 This 'tis:
    Blunt wedges rive hard knots.
 Well, and how?
  ULYSSES.
 Who may you else oppose
    That can from Hector bring those honours off,
    If not Achilles? Though 't be a sportful combat,
    Yet in this trial much opinion dwells;
    For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute
    With their fin'st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,
    Our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
    In this vile action; for the success,
    Although particular, shall give a scantling
    Of good or bad unto the general;
    And in such indexes, although small pricks
    To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
    The baby figure of the giant mas
    Of things to come at large.

    Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
 I see them not with my old eyes.

 I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the
    scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in
    Greece.

  AJAX.
 He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
    sailor breaks a biscuit.
 Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more
    brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinico may tutor thee.
 You scurvy lord!
  AJAX.
 What's the matter?
  THERSITES.
 I know that, fool.
 Therefore I beat thee.
 Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His
    evasions have ears thus long.
 What?
  THERSITES.
 Nay, I must hold you.

  THERSITES.
 I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not-
    he there; that he; look you there.
 Good words, Thersites.

  ACHILLES.

 Yes, good sooth.
 'Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou

 No more words, Thersites; peace!

 Farewell.

    Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
    Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
    Hath been as dear as Helen-I mean, of ours.

    Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds
    A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
    The very wings of reason to his heels
    And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
    Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
    Let's shut our gates and sleep.
 Manhood and honour
    Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts
    With this cramm'd reason.

 Brother, she is not worth what she doth, cost

 'Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.

  HECTOR.
 Cry, Troyans, cry.

  HECTOR.

    Cry, Troyans, cry, A Helen and a woe!  
    Cry, cry.
 Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
    Of divination in our sister work
    Some touches of remorse, or is your blood
    So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
    Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
    Can qualify the same?
  TROILUS.
 Her brain-sick raptures
    Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
    Which hath our several honours all engag'd
    To make it gracious.

  PARIS.

  HECTOR.

    The reasons you allege do more conduce
    To the hot passion of distemp'red blood  
    Than to make up a free determination
    'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
    Of any true decision.
 Thus to persist
    In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
    But makes it much more heavy.

 No Achilles with him.
 The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs
    are legs for necessity, not for flexure.

    Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
    Why we ascribe it to him.

    A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
    Before a sleeping giant.

  AJAX.
 Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better
    man than I am?
  AGAMEMNON.

  AJAX.
 Pride is his own glass,
    his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself  
    but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.
 I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
 O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
    We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
    When they go from Achilles.

    This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
    And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.
 O, no, you shall not go.

    Let me go to him.

 Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure
    Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;
    Fam'd be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
    Thrice-fam'd beyond, beyond all erudition;
    But he that disciplin'd thine arms to fight-
    Let Mars divide eternity in twain
    And give him half; and, for thy vigour,
    Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
    To sinewy Ajax.
 I will not praise thy wisdom,
    Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
    Thy spacious and dilated parts.
 To-morrow
    We must with all our main of power stand fast;
    And here's a lord-come knights from east to west
    And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.

 I do desire it.

 I do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.

 Know you the musicians?
  SERVANT.
 Command, I mean, friend.

  SERVANT.
 Who shall I command, sir?
  PANDARUS.
 At whose request do these men play?
  SERVANT.
 That's to't, indeed, sir.
 Who, my cousin, Cressida?

 Could not you find out that by her

 Nay, this shall not hedge us out.
 -And, my

 No, no, no such matter; you are wide.

 She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.
 Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
 Come, come.

    Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
           For, oh, love's bow
           Shoots buck and doe;
           The shaft confounds
           Not that it wounds,
    But tickles still the sore.
 Is love a generation of
    vipers? Sweet lord, who's a-field today?
  PARIS.
 I would fain have arm'd to-day, but my Nell would not

    Where I may wallow in the lily beds

    From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,
    And fly with me to Cressid!

 Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you.
 Go to, go  
    to.

 Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
 To fear the worst oft
    cures the worse.
 O, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid's pageant
    there is presented no monster.
 They that have the voice of lions and the act
    of hares, are they not monsters?

 Praise us as we are
    tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go bare till merit
    crown it.
  
  CRESSIDA.

  PANDARUS.

 See, see, your silence,
    Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
    My very soul of counsel.
 Stop my mouth.
 Pretty, i' faith.
 Leave! An you take leave till to-morrow morning-
  CRESSIDA.
 You cannot shun yourself.
 Let me go and try.

    I have a kind of self resides with you;
    But an unkind self, that itself will leave
    To be another's fool.
 I would be gone.
 O that I thought it could be in a woman-
    As, if it can, I will presume in you-  
    To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;
    To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
    Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
    That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
    Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
    That my integrity and truth to you
    Might be affronted with the match and weight
    Of such a winnowed purity in love.

    How were I then uplifted! but, alas,
    I am as true as truth's simplicity,
    And simpler than the infancy of truth.
'
  PANDARUS.
 Go to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I'll be the  
    witness.
 Here I hold your hand; here my cousin's.

 Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
  ACHILLES.
 Ha?
  ACHILLES.

  AJAX.
 What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?  
  PATROCLUS.
 But 'tis not so with me:
    Fortune and I are friends; I do enjoy
    At ample point all that I did possess  
    Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
    Something not worth in me such rich beholding
    As they have often given.
 Now, great Thetis' son!
  ACHILLES.
 Heavens, what a man is there!
    A very horse that has he knows not what!  
    Nature, what things there are
    Most abject in regard and dear in use!
    What things again most dear in the esteem
    And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow-
    An act that very chance doth throw upon him-
    Ajax renown'd.
 Then what they do in present,
    Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
    For Time is like a fashionable host,
    That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand;  
    And with his arms out-stretch'd, as he would fly,
    Grasps in the corner.

    One touch of nature makes the whole world kin-
    That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
    Though they are made and moulded of things past,
    And give to dust that is a little gilt
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.

    The present eye praises the present object.

    But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
    When fame shall in our island sound her trump,
    And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
    'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win;
    But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.
 I as your lover speak.
 To this effect, Achilles, have I mov'd you.
 Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
 Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
 A wonder!
  ACHILLES.
 The man's
    undone for ever; for if Hector break not his neck i' th' combat,
    he'll break't himself in vainglory.
 I said 'Good  
    morrow, Ajax'; and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.
' What think you
    of this man that takes me for the general? He's grown a very land
    fish, languageless, a monster.
 Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his  
    tent-
  THERSITES.

  THERSITES.
 God buy you, with all my heart.
 Fare ye well, with all my heart.

  ACHILLES.
 No, but he's out a tune thus.
 I had rather be a tick in a sheep than
    such a valiant ignorance.

    Not palating the taste of her dishonour,

 Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
    He shall unbolt the gates.

  CRESSIDA.
 Hark! there's one up.
 It is your uncle.

    You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
 To do what? to do what? Let her say what.

    What have I brought you to do?
  CRESSIDA.
 Come, come, beshrew your heart! You'll ne'er be good,  
    Nor suffer others.
 Ha! ha!

 My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
    My matter is so rash.
 By Priam, and the general state of Troy.

    They are at hand and ready to effect it.
 A plague upon Antenor! I
    would they had broke's neck.
 Why sigh you so profoundly? Where's my lord? Gone? Tell
    me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
  PANDARUS.
 Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
  CRESSIDA.
 O you gods divine,  
    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
    If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
    Do to this body what extremes you can,
    But the strong base and building of my love
    Is as the very centre of the earth,
    Drawing all things to it.
 I'll go in and weep-
  PANDARUS.
 Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,
    Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,
    With sounding 'Troilus.

ACT IV.
 Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity
    That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
    More bright in zeal than the devotion which
    Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
 Have the gods envy?
  PANDARUS.

    We two, that with so many thousand sighs
    Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
    With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
 [Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
  TROILUS.
 I true! how now! What wicked deem is this?
  TROILUS.

    The Grecian youths are full of quality;
    They're loving, well compos'd with gifts of nature,
    And flowing o'er with arts and exercise.

  CRESSIDA.
 I cannot sing,
    Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
    Nor play at subtle games-fair virtues all,
    To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant;
    But I can tell that in each grace of these
    There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil  
    That tempts most cunningly.

  CRESSIDA.
 Come, kiss; and let us part.

 I tell thee, lord of Greece,
    She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises

 And know you, lord,
    I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
    She shall be priz'd.
 But that you say 'Be't so,'

    And parted thus you and your argument.

  MENELAUS.
 Lady, by your leave.

  CRESSIDA.
 You are an odd man; give even or give none.
 You fillip me o' th' head.

  ULYSSES.
 I do desire it.
 Why, beg then.

  CRESSIDA.
 I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.
 Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
 A woman of quick sense.
 Fie, fie upon her!
    There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
    Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
    At every joint and motive of her body.
 Yonder comes the troop.
 Which way would Hector have it?
  AENEAS.

  AENEAS.
 Therefore Achilles.
 Weigh him well,
    And that which looks like pride is courtesy.

    This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood;
    In love whereof half Hector stays at home;
    Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
    This blended knight, half Troyan and half Greek.

  ACHILLES.
 The youngest son of Priam, a true knight;
    Not yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word;
    Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
    Not soon provok'd, nor being provok'd soon calm'd;
    His heart and hand both open and both free;
    For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,
    Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
    Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
    Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
    For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
    To tender objects, but he in heat of action
    Is more vindicative than jealous love.

  AJAX.
 I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

  AENEAS.
 Ajax, farewell.

  HECTOR.
 The worthiest of them tell me name by name;  
    But for Achilles, my own searching eyes
    Shall find him by his large and portly size.

  AGAMEMNON.

    You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
 O you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
    Mock not that I affect the untraded oath;
    Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove.
  
    She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.

  HECTOR.
 He was a soldier good,
    But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
    Never like thee.

  HECTOR.

    Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.

  NESTOR.

    Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Troyan dead,
    Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
    In Ilion on your Greekish embassy.

    After the General, I beseech you next
    To feast with me and see me at my tent.

  HECTOR.
 Is this Achilles?
  ACHILLES.

  ACHILLES.
 Behold thy fill.
 Answer me, heavens.
 Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
    I'd not believe thee.

    His insolence draws folly from my lips;
    But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
    Or may I never-
  AJAX.

    You may have every day enough of Hector,
    If you have stomach.
 Thy hand upon that match.
 At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE

COMMERCIALLY.
 Male varlet, you rogue! What's that?
  THERSITES.
 Do I curse thee?
  PATROCLUS.
 My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
    From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.

    Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent;
    This night in banqueting must all be spent.
 We go wrong, we go wrong.
 I trouble you.

  DIOMEDES.
 They say he keeps a
    Troyan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent.
 How now, my charge!
  CRESSIDA.
 Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.

  DIOMEDES.
 What shall she remember?
  ULYSSES.
 List!
  CRESSIDA.
 Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
 Nay, then-
  CRESSIDA.

  DIOMEDES.
 I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
    Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.
  
  TROILUS.
 No, no, good night; I'll be your fool no more.

  ULYSSES.

  TROILUS.
 I prithee stay.

  ULYSSES.
 I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments,
    I will not speak a word.
 How now, my lord?
  TROILUS.

  CRESSIDA.
 Come, come.
 Fear me not, my lord;
    I will not be myself, nor have cognition
    Of what I feel.
 Well said, whetstone.
 What, this?  
  DIOMEDES.

  DIOMEDES.
 I had your heart before; this follows it.
 You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
    I'll give you something else.
 I will have this.
 Whose was it?
  CRESSIDA.

  DIOMEDES.

  CRESSIDA.

  CRESSIDA.
 You shall not go.
 I do not like this fooling.
 I shall be plagu'd.
                 Exit DIOMEDES
    Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee;
    But with my heart the other eye doth see.

    Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
    The error of our eye directs our mind.
 All's done, my lord.

  TROILUS.

  ULYSSES.

    But if I tell how these two did coact,
    Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
    Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
    An esperance so obstinately strong,
    That doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears;
    As if those organs had deceptious functions
    Created only to calumniate.
 I cannot conjure, Troyan.

  ULYSSES.
 Most sure she was.
  
  TROILUS.
 Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
 Nor mine, my lord.
 Rather think this not Cressid.
 What hath she done, Prince, that can soil our mothers?
  TROILUS.
 Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
 Will 'a swagger himself out on's own eyes?
  TROILUS.
  
    Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
    Of this strange nature, that a thing inseparate
    Divides more wider than the sky and earth;
    And yet the spacious breadth of this division
    Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
    As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.

    Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself:
    The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolv'd, and loos'd;
    And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
    The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
    The fragments, scraps, the bits, and greasy relics
    Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
 May worthy Troilus be half-attach'd
    With that which here his passion doth express?
  TROILUS.
 I have been seeking you this hour, my lord.
 I'll bring you to the gates.
 Accept distracted thanks.

Troy.
 When was my lord so much ungently temper'd
    To stop his ears against admonishment?
    Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
 You train me to offend you; get you in.

    By all the everlasting gods, I'll go.

  HECTOR.

    Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
    Pursue we him on knees; for I have dreamt
    Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
    Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
 Ho! bid my trumpet sound.
 No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!
  HECTOR.
 Be gone, I say.

    Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
    And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.

  TROILUS.

  TROILUS.

  HECTOR.
 O, 'tis fair play!
  TROILUS.

  HECTOR.

    Therefore, come back.
 Aeneas is a-field;
    And I do stand engag'd to many Greeks,
    Even in the faith of valour, to appear
    This morning to them.

    You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
    Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
    To take that course by your consent and voice
    Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
 O Priam, yield not to him!
  ANDROMACHE.
 O, farewell, dear Hector!
    Look how thou diest.

    Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents.
 Away, away!
  CASSANDRA.

  PRIAM.
 Alarums
  TROILUS.

  TROILUS.
 Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart;
    Th' effect doth operate another way.

The plain between Troy and the Grecian camp

Enter THERSITES.
 That dissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has got that same
    scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his
    helm.

  DIOMEDES.
 Hold thy whore, Grecian; now for thy whore,
    Troyan-now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
                                 Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES fighting

                        Enter HECTOR

  HECTOR.
 SCENE 5.
 The dreadful Sagittary
    Appals our numbers.
 Haste we, Diomed,
    To reinforcement, or we perish all.

    There is a thousand Hectors in the field;
    Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
    And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
    And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
    Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
    And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
    Fall down before him like the mower's swath.

    Patroclus' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood,
    Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
    That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to
    him, Crying on Hector.
 Troilus! thou coward Troilus!                            Exit
  DIOMEDES.
                              Exit
                      Enter ACHILLES

  ACHILLES.
 Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head.


                     Enter DIOMEDES

  DIOMEDES.
 I would correct him.
 Ha! art thou there?
  AJAX.
                              Exit
  HECTOR.
 Ajax hath ta'en Aeneas.
 Fate, hear me what I say:
    I reck not though thou end my life to-day.

Another part of the plain

Enter ACHILLES, with Myrmidons

  ACHILLES.
 Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
    Mark what I say.

    Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye.
 Now, bull!
    now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-horn'd Spartan! 'loo,
    Paris, 'loo! The bull has the game.

  THERSITES.
 A bastard son of Priam's.

                                                       [HECTOR falls]
    So, Ilion, fall thou next! Come, Troy, sink down;
    Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.

  ACHILLES.
 Shout.
 Hark! hark! what shout is this?
  NESTOR.
 [Within] Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain.
 Achilles!
  DIOMEDES.
 If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
    Great Hector was as good a man as he.
 March patiently along.


                         Enter TROILUS

  TROILUS.
 Hector! The gods forbid!
  TROILUS.

    I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
    And linger not our sure destructions on.
 My lord, you do discomfort all the host.
 You understand me not that tell me so.
'
    There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
    Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
    Cold statues of the youth; and, in a word,
    Scare Troy out of itself.
 Hence, broker-lackey.

    Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
    And at that time bequeath you my diseases.

SCENE:
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it



ACT I.

The DUKE'S palace

Enter ORSINO, Duke of Illyria, CURIO, and other LORDS; MUSICIANS attending

  DUKE.

    O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
    Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence!
    That instant was I turn'd into a hart,
    And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
    E'er since pursue me.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.

The sea-coast

Enter VIOLA, a CAPTAIN, and SAILORS

  VIOLA.
 True, madam, and, to comfort you with chance,
    Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
    When you, and those poor number saved with you,
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
    Most provident in peril, bind himself-
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practice-
    To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
    Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
    I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
    So long as I could see.
 For saying so, there's gold.

  VIOLA.
 What's she?
  CAPTAIN.
 A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
    That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her  
    In the protection of his son, her brother,
    Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
    They say, she hath abjur'd the company
    And sight of men.

  VIOLA.
 That were hard to compass,
    Because she will admit no kind of suit-
    No, not the Duke's.
 There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;
    And though that nature with a beauteous wall
    Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
    I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
    With this thy fair and outward character.
 Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits
    of order.

  MARIA.

  SIR TOBY.
 Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys,
    and speaks three or four languages word for word without book,
    and hath all the good gifts of nature.

  MARIA.
 Who are they?
  MARIA.


                    Enter SIR ANDREW AGUECHEEK  

  AGUECHEEK.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

    Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
  MARIA.
 Fare you well, gentlemen.
 It's dry, sir.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Are you full of them?
  MARIA.
 O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary! When did I see
    thee so put down?
  AGUECHEEK.
 Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
    me down.
 Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Tut, there's life in't, man.

  SIR TOBY.
 Faith, I can cut a caper.

  SIR TOBY.
 And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as
    any man in Illyria.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Let me see the caper.
 Ha,
    higher! Ha, ha, excellent!                            Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 Here comes the Count.

  DUKE.

  VIOLA.

  VIOLA.
 O, then unfold the passion of my love,
    Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith!
    It shall become thee well to act my woes:
    She will attend it better in thy youth
    Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
 I think not so, my lord.
 [Aside] Yet, a barful strife!
    Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

OLIVIA'S house

Enter MARIA and CLOWN

  MARIA.
 Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open
    my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse; my
    lady will hang thee for thy absence.
 Let her hang me.
 I can tell thee where that saying was
    born, of 'I fear no colours.
 Where, good Mistress Mary?
  MARIA.

  CLOWN.

  MARIA.

  MARIA.
 For what says
    Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.
 Take the fool away.

  CLOWN.

  OLIVIA.

  OLIVIA.
 Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your
    proof.

  OLIVIA.
 The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul
    being in heaven.

  CLOWN.

  OLIVIA.
 Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

  OLIVIA.

  CLOWN.
 There's one at the gate.
 Let him be the devil an he will, I care not; give me
    faith, say I.
  
  OLIVIA.

  OLIVIA.
 He is very well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one
    would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
 Call in my gentlewoman.
                     Exit

                          Re-enter MARIA

  OLIVIA.
 Give me my veil; come, throw it o'er my face;  
    We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
 Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
 Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty- I pray you
    tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.
 Good
    beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to
    the least sinister usage.
 Whence came you, sir?
  VIOLA.
 Are you a comedian?
  VIOLA.
 No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice
    I swear, I am not that I play.

  OLIVIA.
 It alone concerns your ear.

  OLIVIA.
 What I am and what I would are as secret as
    maidenhead- to your cars, divinity; to any other's, profanation.
 Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
    face? You are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain
    and show you the picture.

  VIOLA.
 You might do much.
 Fare you well.
 I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse;
    My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
 Not too fast! Soft, soft!  
    Unless the master were the man.
 Madam, I will.
 I do I know not what, and fear to find
    Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.
 No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere
    extravagancy.
 You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
    which I call'd Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of
    Messaline whom I know you have heard of.
 Alas the day!
  SEBASTIAN.
 A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,
    was yet of many accounted beautiful; but though I could not with
    such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will
    boldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call
    fair.
 Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

  SEBASTIAN.
            Exit




SCENE II.
 Were you not ev'n now with the Countess Olivia?
  VIOLA.
 Receive it so.
 Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is
    it should be so return'd.
 If it be so- as 'tis-
    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.

    Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness
    Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.

OLIVIA'S house

Enter SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW

  SIR TOBY.
 Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
    is to be up late.

  SIR TOBY.

  SIR TOBY.

  AGUECHEEK.
 I had
    rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a
    breath to sing, as the fool has.
 I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no
    whipstock.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
    done.
 Now, a song.

  SIR TOBY.

           In delay there lies no plenty,
           Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty;
             Youth's a stuff will not endure.
 A contagious breath.
 But shall
    we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in
    a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do
    that?
  AGUECHEEK.
'
  CLOWN.
 Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.
 I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
                                                [Sings]
              There dwelt a man in Babylon,
              Lady, lady.
 Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Sneck up!
  MALVOLIO.

  SIR TOBY.
 Nay, good Sir Toby.
 [Sings] His eyes do show his days are almost done.
 This is much credit to you.
 [Sings] O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.
 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's ahungry,
    to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him
    and make a fool of him.

  MARIA.
 I know I can
    do it.

  AGUECHEEK.

  SIR TOBY.
 Sport royal, I warrant you.
 I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where
    he shall find the letter; observe his construction of it.
 I was ador'd once too.

  AGUECHEEK.

  SIR TOBY.
 Now, good morrow, friends.
 Who was it?
  CURIO.
 A little, by your favour.
 About your years, my lord.
                               [Music]  

                     FESTE'S SONG

            Come away, come away, death;
          And in sad cypress let me be laid;
            Fly away, fly away, breath,
          I am slain by a fair cruel maid.

  CLOWN.
 No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.

  CLOWN.
 Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy
    doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal.
 I
    would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business
    might be everything, and their intent everywhere: for that's it
    that always makes a good voyage of nothing.

                                     Exeunt CURIO and ATTENDANTS
    Once more, Cesario,
    Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
 Must she not then be answer'd?
  DUKE.

    Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-
    No motion of the liver, but the palate-
    That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
    But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
    And can digest as much.
 Make no compare
    Between that love a woman can bear me
    And that I owe Olivia.
 What dost thou know?
  VIOLA.
 She pin'd in thought;
    And with a green and yellow melancholy
    She sat like Patience on a monument,
    Smiling at grief.

OLIVIA'S garden

Enter SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN

  SIR TOBY.
 I would exult, man; you know he brought me out o' favour
    with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
 Here comes the little villain.

    How now, my metal of India!
  MARIA.
 Observe him, for the love of
    mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot
    of him.
 Maria once told me she
    did affect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that,
    should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion.
 O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him;
    how he jets under his advanc'd plumes!
  AGUECHEEK.
 O, peace! Now he's deeply in; look how imagination blows
    him.

  MALVOLIO.
 Calling my officers about me, in my branch'd velvet gown,
    having come from a day-bed- where I have left Olivia sleeping-
  SIR TOBY.
 O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
 Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for
    him.
 And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
  MALVOLIO.

  MALVOLIO.
 Now is the woodcock near the gin.
 O, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading
    aloud to him!
  MALVOLIO.
 Soft! And the
    impressure her Lucrece with which she uses to seal; 'tis my lady.
' What follows? The numbers alter'd!
    'No man must know.
 [Reads]

             'I may command where I adore;
               But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
             With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;
               M.
 O.
 Excellent wench, say I.
' Why, she may command me: I
    serve her; she is my lady.
 Why, this is evident to any formal
    capacity; there is no obstruction in this.
 Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as rank
    as a fox.

  MALVOLIO.
 Did not I say he would work it out?
    The cur is excellent at faults.

  FABIAN.
 And O shall end, I hope.
 Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry 'O!'
  MALVOLIO.
 And then I comes behind.
 Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and
    wish'd to see thee ever cross-garter'd.
 I will be strange, stout, in
    yellow stockings, and cross-garter'd, even with the swiftness of
    putting on.
 Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
    postscript.
                                           Exit
  FABIAN.

  SIR TOBY.

  
                          Enter MARIA

  AGUECHEEK.

  FABIAN.
 Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
  AGUECHEEK.
 Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
  SIR TOBY.
 He will come to her in yellow
    stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhors, and cross-garter'd, a
    fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now
    be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
    melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable
    contempt.
 I'll make one too.

ACT III.
 Save thee, friend, and thy music!
    Dost thou live by thy tabor?
  CLOWN.
 To see this age! A sentence is but a
    chev'ril glove to a good wit.
 Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word  
    might make my sister wanton.

  CLOWN.

  VIOLA.
 I am
    indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.

  VIOLA.
 Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
  VIOLA.

  VIOLA.
 I understand you, sir; 'tis well begg'd.
 The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar:
    Cressida was a beggar.

                                                      Exit CLOWN
  VIOLA.

  SIR TOBY.
 I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the list of my
    voyage.
 Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
 I will answer you with gait and entrance.
 That youth's a rare courtier- 'Rain odours' well!
  VIOLA.
 'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed'- I'll get 'em all
    three all ready.
 What is your name?
  VIOLA.
 My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
    Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment.
  
  VIOLA.
 Dear lady-
  OLIVIA.

    O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
    If one should be a prey, how much the better
    To fall before the lion than the wolf!       [Clock strikes]
    The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.

    Be not afraid, good youth; I will not have you;
    And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
    Your wife is like to reap a proper man.

  VIOLA.

  VIOLA.
 Then think you right: I am not what I am.
 By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
    I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
    And that no woman has; nor never none
    Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.

  SIR TOBY.
 Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
 As plain as I see you now.
 This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
 The double gilt of
    this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail'd
    into the north of my lady's opinion; where you will hang like an
    icicle on Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some
    laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

  AGUECHEEK.
 An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I
    hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
 My niece shall take note of it; and assure
    thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in
    man's commendation with woman than report of valour.

  FABIAN.
 We'll call thee at the cubiculo.
 This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby.
 He does obey every
    point of the letter that I dropp'd to betray him.
 I would not by my will have troubled you;
    But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
    I will no further chide you.

  SEBASTIAN.
 To-morrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.
 Belike you slew great number of his people.
Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature;
    Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
    Might well have given us bloody argument.

    It might have since been answer'd in repaying
    What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
    Most of our city did.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Why I your purse?
  ANTONIO.
 I do remember.
                               Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 I have sent after him; he says he'll come.

    How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?
    For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.

    Where is Malvolio?
  MARIA.
 He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner.
 No, madam, he does nothing but smile.

  MALVOLIO.
 Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?
  MALVOLIO.
 Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.
 To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I'll come to thee.
 What mean'st thou by that, Malvolio?
  AIALVOLIO.
 'Some are born great,'-
  OLIVIA.
 'Some achieve greatness,'-
  OLIVIA.
'
  OLIVIA.
 'Thy yellow stockings?'
  MALVOLIO.
 'And wish'd to see thee cross-garterd.
 'If not, let me see thee a servant still.

  OLIVIA.

    Let me alone.
 Carry his water to th' wise woman.

  MARIA.
 Ay, Biddy, come with me.
 Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
 My prayers, minx!
  MARIA.
 Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle shallow things; I
    am not of your element; you shall know more hereafter.

  MARIA.
 The house will be the quieter.
 My niece
    is already in the belief that he's mad.
 Is't so saucy?
  AGUECHEEK.

  SIR TOBY.
 [Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do
    call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.
 Very brief, and to exceeding good sense- less.
 'Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain.
 Still you keep o' th' windy side of the law.
 [Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of
    our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better,
    and so look to thyself.
 Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy
    sworn enemy,
                                              ANDREW AGUECHEEK.

  SIR TOBY.
 Nay, let me alone for swearing.
 This
    will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the
    look, like cockatrices.


                Re-enter OLIVIA.

    What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
    That honour sav'd may upon asking give?
  VIOLA.

  OLIVIA.
 I will acquit you.

  OLIVIA.

  VIOLA.
 And you, sir.

  VIOLA.
 Will you
    walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
  
  VIOLA.


              Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA

    [To FABIAN] I have his horse to take up the quarrel; I have
    persuaded him the youth's a devil.

  VIOLA.

  VIOLA.
 He will bear you easily and reins well.

  ANTONIO.
 [To VIOLA] This comes with seeking you;
    But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.

    What will you do, now my necessity
    Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
    Much more for what I cannot do for you
    Than what befalls myself.
 You stand amaz'd;
    But be of comfort.
 My having is not much;
    I'll make division of my present with you;
    Hold, there's half my coffer.

  FIRST OFFICER.
 What's that to us? The time goes by; away.

    Virtue is beauty; but the beauteous evil
    Are empty trunks, o'erflourish'd by the devil.

  FIRST OFFICER.
 Lead me on.
 Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian; we'll whisper
    o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.

  FABIAN.
 And I do not-                                  Exit
  FABIAN.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Vent my folly! I am afraid this great
    lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.
 By my troth, thou hast an open hand.

  AGUECHEEK.
 I'll go another way to work with
    him; I'll have an action of battery against him, if there be any
    law in Illyria; though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for
    that.
 I will be free from thee.
     [Draws]
  SIR TOBY.
 What relish is in this? How runs the stream?
    Or I am mad, or else this is a dream.

    Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
    If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
  OLIVIA.
 Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him
    believe thou art Sir Topas the curate; do it quickly.


                 Enter SIR TOBY and MARIA

  SIR TOBY.

  CLOWN.
 What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!
  SIR TOBY.
 The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

  MALVOLIO.

  CLOWN.
 Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this man!
    Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
  SIR TOBY.
 Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest
    terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil
    himself with courtesy.
  
  CLOWN.

  MALVOLIO.
 What think'st thou of his opinion?
  MALVOLIO.

  CLOWN.
 Fare thee well.

  MARIA.
 To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou
    find'st him.
 I would we were well rid of this knavery.
 Come by and by to my chamber.

  MALVOLIO.
 Fool!
  CLOWN.
 [Sings] She loves another- Who calls, ha?
  MALVOLIO.
  
  CLOWN.
 Fool, there was never man so notoriously abus'd;
    I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
 But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in
    your wits than a fool.
 Sir Topas!
  CLOWN.
- Who, I, sir? Not
    I, sir.
- I will sir, I
    will.

  MALVOLIO.
 Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.
  
  CLOWN.
 Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree; I prithe be
    gone.

  CLOWN.
 Blame not this haste of mine.
 Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine  
    That they may fairly note this act of mine!           Exeunt

 Now, as thou lov'st me, let me see his letter.
 Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
 This is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog
    again.
 Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.

  CLOWN.
 How can that be?  
  CLOWN.

  DUKE.

  DUKE.
 Thou shalt not be the worse for me.

  DUKE.

  CLOWN.
 Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.
 But, as you say, sir, let your bounty
    take a nap; I will awake it anon.
                       Exit

                 Enter ANTONIO and OFFICERS

  VIOLA.
 Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
 Orsino, this is that Antonio
    That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
    And this is he that did the Tiger board
    When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.

    Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
    In private brabble did we apprehend him.
 Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief!
    What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
    Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
    Hast made thine enemies?
  ANTONIO.
 When came he to this town?
  ANTONIO.

    Three months this youth hath tended upon me-
    But more of that anon.
 What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord-
  VIOLA.

  DUKE.
 Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
 But hear me this:
    Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
    And that I partly know the instrument
    That screws me from my true place in your favour,
    Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
    But this your minion, whom I know you love,
    And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
    Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
    Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.

  VIOLA.
 Where goes Cesario?
  VIOLA.
                Exit an ATTENDANT
  DUKE.
 No, my lord, not I.

  OLIVIA.

    Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up;  
    Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
    As great as that thou fear'st.
 For the love of God, a surgeon!
    Send one presently to Sir Toby.
 Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a
    bloody coxcomb too.
 Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
  AGUECHEEK.
  
  DUKE.
 Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
    nothing; and that that did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby.
 Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.

    You drew your sword upon me without cause;
    But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.
 How now, gentleman? How is't with you?
  SIR TOBY.
 That's all one; has hurt me, and there's th' end on't.
 I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dress'd
    together.

  SIR TOBY.
 I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;
    But, had it been the brother of my blood,
    I must have done no less with wit and safety.

    You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
    I do perceive it hath offended you.

  SEBASTIAN.

  SEBASTIAN.

  VIOLA.
 Be not amaz'd; right noble is his blood.

  DUKE.
 Give me thy hand;
    And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

  VIOLA.
 He, upon some action,  
    Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
    A gentleman and follower of my lady's.

  OLIVIA.

    How does he, sirrah?
  CLOWN.

  OLIVIA.
 Open't, and read it.

  CLOWN.
 How now! Art thou mad?  
  CLOWN.
 An your ladyship will have
    it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.
 Though you have put me into darkness and given
    your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my
    senses as well as your ladyship.
 A sister! You are she.
 Is this the madman?
  OLIVIA.

  OLIVIA.
 Have I, Malvolio? No.

    You must not now deny it is your hand;
    Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase;
    Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention;
    You can say none of this.
 Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
    Though, I confess, much like the character;  
    But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.

  FABIAN.
 Alas, poor fool, how have they baffl'd thee!
  CLOWN.
 'By the Lord,
    fool, I am not mad!' But do you remember- 'Madam, why laugh you
    at such a barren rascal? An you smile not, he's gagg'd'? And thus
    the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
 I'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you.
 Meantime, sweet sister,
    We will not part from hence.
 Cesario, come;
    For so you shall be while you are a man;  
    But when in other habits you are seen,
    Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen.


           But when I came to man's estate,
             With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
           'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
             For the rain it raineth every day.

SCENE:  
Verona; Milan; the frontiers of Mantua


ACT I.
 Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.

    Were't not affection chains thy tender days
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    I rather would entreat thy company
    To see the wonders of the world abroad,
    Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,
    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.

  VALENTINE.
 That's on some shallow story of deep love:
    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.

  PROTEUS.
 No, I will not, for it boots thee not.

  PROTEUS.
  
  VALENTINE.
 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

  PROTEUS.
 And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

  VALENTINE.
 All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
  VALENTINE.
 Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
    An if the shepherd be awhile away.
 You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
    I a sheep?
  PROTEUS.
 A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
 This proves me still a sheep.
 Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.

  PROTEUS.
 Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.
 Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
    mutton; and she, a lac'd mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing
    for my labour.

  PROTEUS.
  [Nodding]  Ay.
 And that set together is 'noddy.
 Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
    word 'noddy' for my pains.

  PROTEUS.
 Well, sir, here is for your pains.

  PROTEUS.
         Exit SPEED
    I must go send some better messenger.

Verona.
 But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
    Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
  LUCETTA.
 Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
 Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA.
 How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA.
 Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame  
    That I, unworthy body as I am,
    Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.

  JULIA.
 I have no other but a woman's reason:
    I think him so, because I think him so.

  JULIA.

  LUCETTA.

  JULIA.
 Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
    Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
    To whisper and conspire against my youth?
    Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,
    And you an officer fit for the place.

    There, take the paper; see it be return'd;
    Or else return no more into my sight.

  JULIA.
  
  JULIA.
 Nothing concerning me.

  LUCETTA.

  JULIA.

  LUCETTA.
 She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
    To be so ang'red with another letter.

    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.
 If you respect them, best to take them up.

  JULIA.
 ANTONIO'S house

Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO

  ANTONIO.
 Why, what of him?
  PANTHINO.
 He wond'red that your lordship
    Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
    While other men, of slender reputation,
    Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
    Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
    Some to discover islands far away;
    Some to the studious universities.
 'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
    There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
    Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
    And be in eye of every exercise
    Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
 I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis'd;
    And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
    The execution of it shall make known:  
    Even with the speediest expedition
    I will dispatch him to the Emperor's court.

  PANTHINO.
 How now! What letter are you reading there?
  PROTEUS.
 May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
    Of commendations sent from Valentine,  
    Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.

  ANTONIO.
 My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
    Please you, deliberate a day or two.
  
  ANTONIO.
  
  PROTEUS.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.
 SCENE I.

Milan.
 Sir, your glove.

  VALENTINE.
 Not mine: my gloves are on.
 Why, then, this may be yours; for this is but one.
 Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;
    Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
    Ah, Silvia! Silvia!
  SPEED.

  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.
 Why, sir, I know her not.
 Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE.
 What dost thou know?
  SPEED.

  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.
 Why?
  SPEED.
 O that you had mine eyes; or your own
    eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir
    Proteus for going ungarter'd!
  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.

  SPEED.

  SPEED.

  SPEED.
 As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
    Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
    Which I was much unwilling to proceed in,
    But for my duty to your ladyship.
 Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
    But I will none of them; they are for you:  
    I would have had them writ more movingly.
 Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.

  SILVIA.

  VALENTINE.
 To whom?
  SPEED.
 To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.

  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.

  SPEED.
 Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on
    the air, I am one that am nourish'd by my victuals, and would
    fain have meat.
 Have patience, gentle Julia.

  JULIA.

  PROTEUS.
 Here, take you this.

  PROTEUS.

    Julia, farewell!                                  Exit JULIA  
    What, gone without a word?
    Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
    For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

    Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

Verona.
 I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear.
 Now come I to my mother.


                            Enter PANTHINO

  PANTHINO.
 Launce, away, away, aboard! Thy master is shipp'd, and
    thou art to post after with oars.
 What's the unkindest tide?  
  LAUNCE.
 Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the
    service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able
    to fill it with my tears; if the wind were down, I could drive
    the boat with my sighs.

  PANTHINO.
 Will thou go?
  LAUNCE.
 The DUKE'S palace

Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED

  SILVIA.
 Servant, you are sad.
 Seem you that you are not?
  VALENTINE.
 Wise.

  THURIO.

  THURIO.

  THURIO.
 Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.

  THURIO.

  VALENTINE.

  THURIO.

  SILVIA.

  THURIO.
  
  VALENTINE.

    What say you to a letter from your friends
    Of much good news?
  VALENTINE.
 Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
    To be of worth and worthy estimation,
    And not without desert so well reputed.
 I knew him as myself; for from our infancy
    We have convers'd and spent our hours together;
    And though myself have been an idle truant,
    Omitting the sweet benefit of time
    To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
    Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
    Made use and fair advantage of his days:
    His years but young, but his experience old;
    His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;
    And, in a word, for far behind his worth
    Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
    He is complete in feature and in mind,
    With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

  VALENTINE.

  DUKE.
           Exit DUKE
  VALENTINE.

  SILVIA.

  SILVIA.
 Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
    How could he see his way to seek out you?
  VALENTINE.
 His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
    If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.

  SILVIA.
 Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
    To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
 Leave off discourse of disability;
    Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
 I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
 Once more, new servant, welcome.
 How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS.
 Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.

    Was this the idol that you worship so?
  VALENTINE.
 No; but she is an earthly paragon.
 When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
    And I must minister the like to you.
  
  VALENTINE.

    My foolish rival, that her father likes
    Only for his possessions are so huge,
    Is gone with her along; and I must after,
    For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.

  PROTEUS.
 But she loves you?
  VALENTINE.
 Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
    I must unto the road to disembark
    Some necessaries that I needs must use;  
    And then I'll presently attend you.
 Will you make haste?
  PROTEUS.
 A street

Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally

  SPEED.
 I
    reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hang'd,
    nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid, and
    the hostess say 'Welcome!'
  SPEED.
 Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well
    with her.
 What thou say'st?
  LAUNCE.
 It stands under thee, indeed.

  SPEED.
 'Tis well that I get it so.

  SPEED.

  LAUNCE.
 I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.

  SPEED.
 At thy service.

    O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn'd,
    Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
    At first I did adore a twinkling star,
    But now I worship a celestial sun.

    This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
    To climb celestial Silvia's chamber window,
    Myself in counsel, his competitor.

Verona.
 Better forbear till Proteus make return.
 O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
    Pity the dearth that I have pined in
    By longing for that food so long a time.

    The current that with gentle murmur glides,
    Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
    But when his fair course is not hindered,
    He makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones,
    Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
    He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
    And so by many winding nooks he strays,
    With willing sport, to the wild ocean.

    I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,
    And make a pastime of each weary step,
    Till the last step have brought me to my love;
    And there I'll rest as, after much turmoil,  
    A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
 But in what habit will you go along?
  JULIA.
 What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
    Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

  JULIA.
 If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
 Nay, that I will not.
 Then never dream on infamy, but go.

    If Proteus like your journey when you come,
    No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone.

ACT III.

    Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose  
    To cross my friend in his intended drift
    Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
    A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
    Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

  DUKE.

  DUKE.

  DUKE.

    'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
    To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

  VALENTINE.

  DUKE.

  VALENTINE.
 What lets but one may enter at her window?
  DUKE.
 This very night; for Love is like a child,
    That longs for everything that he can come by.
 Then let me see thy cloak.
          [Reads]
      'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
        And slaves they are to me, that send them flying.
 Neither.

  PROTEUS.
 My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
    So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
 Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
    For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.
 No, Valentine.

    Hath she forsworn me?
  PROTEUS.
 Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom-
    Which, unrevers'd, stands in effectual force-
    A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
    Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
    With them, upon her knees, her humble self,
    Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
    As if but now they waxed pale for woe.

    Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love;
    Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
  
    The time now serves not to expostulate.

    As thou lov'st Silvia, though not for thyself,
    Regard thy danger, and along with me.

  PROTEUS.
 Go, sirrah, find him out.

  SPEED.
 Why, as black as ink.
 I will try thee.
 Tell me this: Who begot thee?
  SPEED.

  SPEED.
 Ay, that she can.

  SPEED.
'
  LAUNCE.
'
  LAUNCE.
 What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can
    knit him a stock.
'
  LAUNCE.
 That's as much as to say 'bastard virtues'; that indeed
    know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.
 Close at the heels of her virtues.
'
  LAUNCE.
 'Item: She is proud.
 'Item: She hath no teeth.

  SPEED.
 'Item: She is too liberal.

  SPEED.
 What's next?
  SPEED.
'
  LAUNCE.
 Thou must run to him, for thou hast stay'd so long that
    going will scarce serve the turn.

Milan.
 The DUKE'S palace

Enter DUKE and THURIO

  DUKE.
 Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
    Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
  
  PROTEUS.

  DUKE.

    Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee-
    For thou hast shown some sign of good desert-
    Makes me the better to confer with thee.

  DUKE.

  DUKE.
 Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

  DUKE.

    But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
    You must lay lime to tangle her desires
    By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
    Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
 Say that upon the altar of her beauty
    You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;  
    Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
    Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
    That may discover such integrity;
    For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
    Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
    Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans
    Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
 And thy advice this night I'll put in practice;
    Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
    Let us into the city presently
    To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.

    I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
    To give the onset to thy good advice.
  
  DUKE.

  SECOND OUTLAW.
 Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye;
    If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you.
 Then know that I have little wealth to lose;
    A man I am cross'd with adversity;
    My riches are these poor habiliments,
    Of which if you should here disfurnish me,  
    You take the sum and substance that I have.

  THIRD OUTLAW.
 Have you long sojourn'd there?
  VALENTINE.
 For what offence?
  VALENTINE.
 For that which now torments me to rehearse:
    I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
    But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
    Without false vantage or base treachery.

  VALENTINE.
 Nothing but my fortune.
 And I for such-like petty crimes as these.

  FIRST OUTLAW.

  SECOND OUTLAW.

  VALENTINE.
 How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
  PROTEUS.
 Who? Silvia?
  PROTEUS.
 Come, we'll have you merry; I'll bring you where you shall
    hear music, and see the gentleman that you ask'd for.


         Is she kind as she is fair?
           For beauty lives with kindness.

         Love doth to her eyes repair,
           To help him of his blindness;
         And, being help'd, inhabits there.

  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 I perceive you delight not in music.
 Not a whit, when it jars so.
 Hark, what fine change is in the music!
  JULIA.
 I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov'd her out of
    all nick.

  JULIA.
 Gone to seek his dog, which to-morrow, by his master's
    command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
 Where meet we?
  PROTEUS.
 Farewell.
                  Exeunt THURIO and MUSICIANS

                  Enter SILVIA above, at her window

  PROTEUS.
  
    Who is that that spake?
  PROTEUS.
 Sir Proteus, as I take it.

  SILVIA.
 Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
 Go to thy lady's grave, and call hers thence;
    Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
  [Aside]  He heard not that.

  JULIA.
 Who calls?
  EGLAMOUR.
 As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
    According to your ladyship's impose,
    I am thus early come to know what service
    It is your pleasure to command me in.

  SILVIA.
 O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
    Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not-  
    Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd.
 Madam, I pity much your grievances;
    Which since I know they virtuously are plac'd,
    I give consent to go along with you,
    Recking as little what betideth me
    As much I wish all good befortune you.
 This evening coming.

Under SILVIA'S Window

Enter LAUNCE with his dog

  LAUNCE.
' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg.
 He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him.
' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he.
.
 But she receiv'd my dog?
  LAUNCE.

    Away, I say.
 Stayest thou to vex me here?        Exit LAUNCE
    A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
    Sebastian, I have entertained thee
    Partly that I have need of such a youth
    That can with some discretion do my business,
    For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
    But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
    Which, if my augury deceive me not,
    Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth;
    Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.
 Not so; I think she lives.
 Alas!
  PROTEUS.

    'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
    And thinking on it makes me cry 'Alas!'
  PROTEUS.
 Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
    This letter.
 Tell my lady
    I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.

    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.

    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.

    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

  SILVIA.

  SILVIA.

    Go, give your master this.

    This is the letter to your ladyship.
 The more shame for him that he sends it me;
    For I have heard him say a thousand times
    His Julia gave it him at his departure.
 Dost thou know her?
  JULIA.
 Almost as well as I do know myself.
 She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.

    Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this  
    For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.
 And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
 I think,
    If I had such a tire, this face of mine
    Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
    And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
    Unless I flatter with myself too much.

    Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow;
    If that be all the difference in his love,
    I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
 SCENE I.
 O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
    And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS.
 That you are well deriv'd.
 Saw you my daughter?
  PROTEUS.
 Why then,
    She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
    And Eglamour is in her company.

    These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence;
    Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
    But mount you presently, and meet with me
    Upon the rising of the mountain foot
    That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.

    Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
               Exit
  THURIO.
 Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
    That flies her fortune when it follows her.

    I'll after, more to be reveng'd on Eglamour  
    Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
                   Exit
  PROTEUS.

  FIRST OUTLAW.
 Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
    But Moyses and Valerius follow him.

  SILVIA.

    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
  [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
    Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.

  SILVIA.
 O miserable, unhappy that I am!
  PROTEUS.
 Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
    But by my coming I have made you happy.
 By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
  [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

    Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,
    And that's far worse than none; better have none
    Than plural faith, which is too much by one.

  PROTEUS.
 O heaven!
  PROTEUS.

    Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
    Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
    I am sorry I must never trust thee more,  
    But count the world a stranger for thy sake.

  JULIA.
 How! Julia!
  JULIA.

    How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
    O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
    Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me
    Such an immodest raiment- if shame live
    In a disguise of love.
  
  PROTEUS.

  JULIA.

  DUKE.
  
  VALENTINE.
 Here she stands
    Take but possession of her with a touch-
    I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

  DUKE.
 The more degenerate and base art thou
    To make such means for her as thou hast done
    And leave her on such slight conditions.

  VALENTINE.
 I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.

  CAMILLO.

  ARCHIDAMUS.
 Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
    justified in our loves; for indeed-
  CAMILLO.

  CAMILLO.

    Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
    separation of their society, their encounters, though not
    personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts,
    letters, loving embassies; that they have seem'd to be together,
    though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac'd as it
    were from the ends of opposed winds.
 I think there is not in the world either malice or
    matter to alter it.
 Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been
    The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
    Without a burden.

  POLIXENES.
 No longer stay.

  POLIXENES.
 Very sooth, to-morrow.
 My affairs
    Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder
    Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
    To you a charge and trouble.
 Tongue-tied, our Queen? Speak you.

  HERMIONE.
 You, sir,  
    Charge him too coldly.
 Well said, Hermione.
- Yet, good deed, Leontes,
    I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind
    What lady she her lord.

  HERMIONE.
' Verily,
    You shall not go; a lady's 'verily' is
    As potent as a lord's.

  POLIXENES.
 hostess.
 We were, fair Queen,
    Two lads that thought there was no more behind  
    But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
    And to be boy eternal.
 Was not my lord
    The verier wag o' th' two?
  POLIXENES.
 We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' th' sun
    And bleat the one at th' other.
 What we chang'd
    Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
    The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
    That any did.
 One good deed dying tongueless
    Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.

    Our praises are our wages; you may ride's
    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere  
    With spur we heat an acre.

  LEONTES.
 Why, that was when
    Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
    Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
    And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
    'I am yours for ever.
'
  HERMIONE.

    I have tremor cordis on me; my heart dances,
    But not for joy, not joy.
 'T may, I grant;
    But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
    As now they are, and making practis'd smiles
    As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere
    The mort o' th' deer.
 Ay, my good lord.

  LEONTES.
 What! hast smutch'd thy nose?
    They say it is a copy out of mine.
 Come, Captain,
    We must be neat- not neat, but cleanly, Captain.

  LEONTES.
 Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,  
    To be full like me; yet they say we are
    Almost as like as eggs.
 Women say so,
    That will say anything.

    Thou dost make possible things not so held,
    Communicat'st with dreams- how can this be?-
    With what's unreal thou coactive art,
    And fellow'st nothing.

  POLIXENES.

    How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
    Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
    To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
    Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
    Twenty-three years; and saw myself unbreech'd,
    In my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzl'd,
    Lest it should bite its master and so prove,
    As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.

  LEONTES.
 If you would seek us,
    We are yours i' th' garden.
  [Aside]  I am angling now,
    Though you perceive me not how I give line.
 Should all despair
    That hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
    Would hang themselves.
 Many thousand on's
    Have the disease, and feel't not.
 Didst note it?  
  CAMILLO.

  LEONTES.
 Was this taken
    By any understanding pate but thine?
    For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
    More than the common blocks.
 Not noted, is't,
    But of the finer natures, by some severals
    Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes
    Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.

  CAMILLO.

  LEONTES.

  CAMILLO.
 No, no, my lord.
 But I cannot
    Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
    So sovereignly being honourable.

  CAMILLO.
 I am his cupbearer;
    If from me he have wholesome beverage,
    Account me not your servant.


                     Enter POLIXENES

  POLIXENES.
 Methinks
    My favour here begins to warp.

  CAMILLO.
 Do you know, and dare not
    Be intelligent to me? 'Tis thereabouts;
    For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,
    And cannot say you dare not.

  POLIXENES.
 I may not answer.
 Therefore mark my counsel,
    Which must be ev'n as swiftly followed as
    I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
    Cry lost, and so goodnight.

  CAMILLO.

  POLIXENES.
 For what?
  CAMILLO.
 O, then my best blood turn
    To an infected jelly, and my name
    Be yok'd with his that did betray the Best!
    Turn then my freshest reputation to
    A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
    Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
    Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
    That e'er was heard or read!
  CAMILLO.
 For myself, I'll put  
    My fortunes to your service, which are here
    By this discovery lost.

  POLIXENES.
 Give me thy hand;
    Be pilot to me, and thy places shall
    Still neighbour mine.
 It is in mine authority to command
    The keys of all the posterns.
 Please your Highness
    To take the urgent hour.

Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and LADIES

  HERMIONE.
 Come, my gracious lord,
    Shall I be your playfellow?
  MAMILLIUS.
 No, I'll none of you.

  SECOND LADY.
 Who taught't this?
  MAMILLIUS.
 Pray now,
    What colour are your eyebrows?  
  FIRST LADY.
 Blue, my lord.
 Nay, that's a mock.
 I have seen a lady's nose
    That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
 Hark ye:
    The Queen your mother rounds apace.
 Pray you sit by us,
    And tell's a tale.

    Come on, sit down; come on, and do your best
    To fright me with your sprites; you're pow'rfull at it.
 Come on then,
    And give't me in mine ear.
 he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
  FIRST LORD.

    Camillo was his help in this, his pander.
 By his great authority;
    Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
    On your command.

  HERMIONE.

  LEONTES.

  HERMIONE.
 O thou thing!
    Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
    Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
    Should a like language use to all degrees
    And mannerly distinguishment leave out
    Betwixt the prince and beggar.
 How will this grieve you,
    When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
    You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
    You scarce can right me throughly then to say
    You did mistake.
 There's some ill planet reigns.

    I must be patient till the heavens look
    With an aspect more favourable.
 Beseech you all, my lords,
    With thoughts so qualified as your charities
    Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
    The King's will be perform'd!
  LEONTES.
 Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness
    My women may be with me, for you see
    My plight requires it.
 If it prove
    She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
    I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
    Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
    For every inch of woman in the world,
    Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false,
    If she be.
 They are co-heirs;
    And I had rather glib myself than they
    Should not produce fair issue.

 Pray you, then,
    Conduct me to the Queen.

  GAOLER.
 And, madam,
    I must be present at your conference.
 We do not know
    How he may soften at the sight o' th' child:
    The silence often of pure innocence
    Persuades when speaking fails.

  GAOLER.
 If
    The cause were not in being- part o' th' cause,
    She, th' adultress; for the harlot king
    Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
    And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
    I can hook to me- say that she were gone,
    Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
    Might come to me again.

  LEONTES.
  [Exit SERVANT]  Fie, fie! no thought of him!
    The very thought of my revenges that way

    I am as ignorant in that as you
    In so entitling me; and no less honest
    Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
    As this world goes, to pass for honest.
 Take up the bastard;
    Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

    So like to him that got it, if thou hast

    Her children not her husband's!

  DION.
 If th' event o' th' journey
    Prove as successful to the Queen- O, be't so!-
    As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
    The time is worth the use on't.
 Since what I am to say must be but that
    Which contradicts my accusation, and
    The testimony on my part no other
    But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
    To say 'Not guilty.
' Mine integrity
    Being counted falsehood shall, as I express it,
    Be so receiv'd.
 Now for conspiracy:
    I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd  
    For me to try how; all I know of it
    Is that Camillo was an honest man;
    And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
    Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

  HERMIONE.

    You had a bastard by Polixenes,
    And I but dream'd it.
 As you were past all shame-
    Those of your fact are so- so past all truth;
    Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
    Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
    No father owning it- which is indeed
    More criminal in thee than it- so thou
    Shalt feel our justice; in whose easiest passage
    Look for no less than death.

    To me can life be no commodity.

 This news is mortal to the Queen.
 Take her hence.

    I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
    New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo-
    Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy.

    For, being transported by my jealousies
    To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
    Camillo for the minister to poison
    My friend Polixenes; which had been done
    But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
    My swift command, though I with death and with
    Reward did threaten and encourage him,
    Not doing it and being done.
 How he glisters
    Thorough my rust! And how his piety
    Does my deeds make the blacker!

 What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
    What wheels, racks, fires? what flaying, boiling

    Must I receive, whose every word deserves
    To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
    Together working with thy jealousies,
    Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
    For girls of nine- O, think what they have done,
    And then run mad indeed, stark mad; for all
    Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
 The higher pow'rs forbid!

 But, O thou tyrant!  
    Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
    Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee

 I am sorry for't.
 Do not receive affliction
    At my petition; I beseech you, rather  
    Let me be punish'd that have minded you
    Of what you should forget.

 You're a made old man; if the sins of your youth are

 Home, home, the next way! We are lucky, boy; and

SCENE II.
 Say to me, when saw'st thou the
    Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue
    not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have
    approved their virtues.
 Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.
 What his
    happier affairs may be are to me unknown; but I have missingly
    noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent
    to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

  CAMILLO.
 My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.


      The lark, that tirra-lirra chants,
        With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
      Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
        While we lie tumbling in the hay.
 With
    die and drab I purchas'd this caparison; and my revenue is the
    silly-cheat.
 I must have saffron to colour
    the warden pies; mace; dates- none, that's out of my note;
    nutmegs, seven; race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four
    pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o' th' sun.
 O, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and then,
    death, death!
  CLOWN.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 Come, lend me thy
    hand.
 O, good sir, softly, good sir; I fear, sir, my shoulder
    blade is out.
 How now! Canst stand?
  AUTOLYCUS.

    You ha' done me a charitable office.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir.
 Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig! He haunts wakes,  
    fairs, and bear-baitings.

  AUTOLYCUS.

  CLOWN.

  CLOWN.
 Shall I bring thee on the way?
  AUTOLYCUS.
 No, good-fac'd sir; no, sweet sir.
 Then fare thee well.
 But that our feasts
    In every mess have folly, and the feeders
    Digest it with a custom, I should blush
    To see you so attir'd; swoon, I think,
    To show myself a glass.
 Apprehend
    Nothing but jollity.
 The gods themselves,
    Humbling their deities to love, have taken
    The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
    Became a bull and bellow'd; the green Neptune
    A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
    Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
    As I seem now.
 To this I am most constant,
    Though destiny say no.
  
  PERDITA.

    Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
    And let's be red with mirth.

  PERDITA.

    It is my father's will I should take on me
    The hostess-ship o' th' day.
 Reverend sirs,
    For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
    Seeming and savour all the winter long.

  POLIXENES.
 Say there be;
    Yet nature is made better by no mean
    But nature makes that mean; so over that art
    Which you say adds to nature, is an art
    That nature makes.
 You see, sweet maid, we marry
    A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
    And make conceive a bark of baser kind
    By bud of nobler race.
 O, these I lack
    To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend
    To strew him o'er and o'er!
  FLORIZEL.
 No; like a bank for love to lie and play on;
    Not like a corse; or if- not to be buried,
    But quick, and in mine arms.
 Come, take your flow'rs.

 Pray, let's see these
    four threes of herdsmen.
  
  SHEPHERD.
 Why, they stay at door, sir.

    The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
    Up in my heart, which I have given already,
    But not deliver'd.
 Do, and be witness to't.

  POLIXENES.
 And he, and more  
    Than he, and men- the earth, the heavens, and all:
    That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
    Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
    That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
    More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
    Without her love; for her employ them all;
    Commend them and condemn them to her service
    Or to their own perdition.
 I cannot speak
    So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better.

  SHEPHERD.

  SHEPHERD.
 I have, but what of him?
  POLIXENES.

  POLIXENES.

  FLORIZEL.
 He shall not.
 Let him, my son; he shall not need to grieve  
    At knowing of thy choice.
 Come, come, he must not.
 And you, enchantment,
    Worthy enough a herdsman- yea, him too
    That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
    Unworthy thee- if ever henceforth thou
    These rural latches to his entrance open,
    Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
    I will devise a death as cruel for thee
    As thou art tender to't.
  [To FLORIZEL]  Will't please you, sir, be gone?
    I told you what would come of this.

  CAMILLO.
 Why look you so upon me?
    I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
    But nothing alt'red.

 I not purpose it.

    From my succession wipe me, father; I
    Am heir to my affection.

  FLORIZEL.
 Hark, Perdita.
                     [Takes her aside]
    [To CAMILLO]  I'll hear you by and by.

  FLORIZEL.
 Not any yet;
    But as th' unthought-on accident is guilty
    To what we wildly do, so we profess
    Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
    Of every wind that blows.

  FLORIZEL.
 Sir,
    The manner of your bearing towards him, with
    What you as from your father shall deliver,
    Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down;
    The which shall point you forth at every sitting
    What you must say, that he shall not perceive
    But that you have your father's bosom there
    And speak his very heart.

    There is some sap in this.

  CAMILLO.
 One of these is true:
    I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
    But not take in the mind.

  CAMILLO.
 My good Camillo,
    She is as forward of her breeding as
    She is i' th' rear o' our birth.

  CAMILLO.
 Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
    So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

  PERDITA.

 Nay, prithee dispatch.
 The gentleman is half flay'd
    already.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 Are you in camest, sir?  [Aside]  I smell the trick
    on't.


             FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments

    Fortunate mistress- let my prophecy
    Come home to ye!- you must retire yourself
    Into some covert; take your sweetheart's hat
    And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
    Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
    The truth of your own seeming, that you may-
    For I do fear eyes over- to shipboard  
    Get undescried.
 Farewell, my friend.

  FLORIZEL.
 Fortune speed us!  
    Thus we set on, Camillo, to th' sea-side.

  CAMILLO.
 To have an open
    ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a
    cut-purse; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for
    th' other senses.
 What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot
    is here with this exchange! Sure, the gods do this year connive
    at us, and we may do anything extempore.
 Every lane's
    end, every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man  
    work.
 Nay, but hear me.
  [Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!  
  SHEPHERD.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.

  SHEPHERD.
 I know not, an't like you.
 This cannot be but a great courtier.
 His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.
  
  CLOWN.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which
    none must know but the King; and which he shall know within this
    hour, if I may come to th' speech of him.
 Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and  
    vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though
    remov'd fifty times, shall all come under the hangman- which,
    though it be great pity, yet it is necessary.

  CLOWN.

  SHEPHERD.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 In some sort, sir; but though my case be a pitiful one, I
    hope I shall not be flay'd out of it.
 I will trust you.
                              Exeunt SHEPHERD and CLOWN
  AUTOLYCUS.
 If he
    think it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they
    have to the King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for
    being so far officious; for I am proof against that title, and
    what shame else belongs to't.
 To him will I present them.

 One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
    Son of Polixenes, with his princess- she
    The fairest I have yet beheld- desires access

 This is a creature,

    Of all professors else, make proselytes
    Of who she but bid follow.

 Women will love her that she is a woman
    More worth than any man; men, that she is
    The rarest of all women.

  LEONTES.

    Your mother was most true to wedlock, Prince;
    For she did print your royal father off,
    Conceiving you.
 And hath he too
    Expos'd this paragon to th' fearful usage,
    At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
    To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
    Th' adventure of her person?
  FLORIZEL.
 Where the warlike Smalus,
    That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and lov'd?

 The blessed gods
    Purge all infection from our air whilst you
    Do climate here! You have a holy father,
    A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
    So sacred as it is, I have done sin,
    For which the heavens, taking angry note,
    Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
    As he from heaven merits it, with you,  
    Worthy his goodness.
 What might I have been,
    Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
    Such goodly things as you!

    A shepherd's daughter.

 She is,
    When once she is my wife.

 Not a month
    Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
    Than what you look on now.
 Come, good my lord.
 The mantle of Queen Hermione's; her
    jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with
    it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the
    creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness
    which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences-
    proclaim her with all certainty to be the King's daughter.

  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen,
    cannot be spoken of.

 Are they returned to the court?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 Shall we
    thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Our  
    absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
 I brought the old man and his son
    aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I
    know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd's
    daughter- so he then took her to be- who began to be much
    sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather
    continuing, this mystery remained undiscover'd.
 Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
    daughters will be all gentlemen born.
 I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

 Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so preposterous

 Does not the stone rebuke me
    For being more stone than it? O royal piece,

    From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
    Standing like stone with thee!

  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Which fortified her visage from the sun,
  Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
  The carcase of a beauty spent and done.


  A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
  Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
  Of court, of city, and had let go by
  The swiftest hours observed as they flew,
  Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;
  And, privileged by age, desires to know
  In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.


  'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
  And every light occasion of the wind
  Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.

  To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,  
  He had the dialect and different skill,
  Catching all passions in his craft of will,

  'That he did in the general bosom reign
  Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,
  To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain
  In personal duty, following where he haunted.


  'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
  Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;
  Finding myself in honour so forbid,
  With safest distance I mine honour shielded.


  'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
  That we must curb it upon others' proof,
  To be forbod the sweets that seems so good
  For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.


  '"Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
  Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,
  Or my affection put to th' smallest teen,
  Or any of my leisures ever charmed.


  '"O pardon me in that my boast is true!  
  The accident which brought me to her eye
  Upon the moment did her force subdue,
  And now she would the caged cloister fly.


  '"How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!
  The broken bosoms that to me belong
  Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
  And mine I pour your ocean all among.


  'For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
  Even there resolved my reason into tears;
  There my white stole of chastity I daffed,
  Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
  Appear to him as he to me appears,  
  All melting; though our drops this diff'rence bore:
  His poisoned me, and mine did him restore.


  'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
  Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,
  Of burning blushes or of weeping water,
  Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
  In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
  To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,
  Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows;

  'That not a heart which in his level came
  Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
  Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
  And, veiled in them, did win whom he would maim.
