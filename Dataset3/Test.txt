                     12
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
  Then of thy beauty do I question make
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
  And die as fast as they see others grow,
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.

  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Find no determination, then you were
  Your self again after your self's decease,
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.



                     23
  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:  
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.

    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.

  And each (though enemies to either's reign)
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.



                     30
  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.

  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many, now is thine alone.

    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.



                     33
  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:  
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
  
    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
  
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
  I make my love engrafted to this store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
  And by a part of all thy glory live:
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.



                     38
  How can my muse want subject to invent
  While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?  
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.



                     43
  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view things unrespected,
  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.



                     44
  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as think the place where he would be.

  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.

    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.



                     48
  How careful was I when I took my way,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That to my use it might unused stay
  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
  
  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.



                     51  
  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
  Till I return of posting is no need.



                     52
  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  The which he will not every hour survey,
  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.



                     57
  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  I have no precious time at all to spend;
  Nor services to do till you require.
  
    O sure I am the wits of former days,
    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.



                     67
  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace it self with his society?  
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
    O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:  
    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay.



                     73
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
  As after sunset fadeth in the west,
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self that seals up all in rest.



                     79
  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
  And my sick muse doth give an other place.

    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    The worst was this, my love was my decay.

  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.



                     83
  I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set,
  I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you your self being extant well might show,
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.

  Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
  And to the most of praise add something more,
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.



                     88
  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:  
  And I by this will be a gainer too,
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to my self I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.

  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  But in the onset come, so shall I taste
  At first the very worst of fortune's might.

  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
  But these particulars are not my measure,
  All these I better in one general best.

  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.



                     96  
  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
  As on the finger of a throned queen,
  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
  So are those errors that in thee are seen,
  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.

  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer's story tell:
  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:  
  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.

    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.

    Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.



                     102
  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
  I love not less, though less the show appear,
  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,  
  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.

    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    Because I would not dull you with my song.



                     104
  To me fair friend you never can be old,
  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
  Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.

    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.

    Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.



                     112
  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
  For what care I who calls me well or ill,  
  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all the world, and I must strive,
  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.

  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle's compass come,
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
    If this be error and upon me proved,
    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.



                     117
  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,  
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.



                     122
  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  Full charactered with lasting memory,
  Which shall above that idle rank remain  
  Beyond all date even to eternity.

    Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.



                     129
  Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
  Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.

  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
  I grant I never saw a goddess go,
  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.

  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
  Although I swear it to my self alone.

    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    And thence this slander as I think proceeds.



                     132
  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.

    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
'


                     136
  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,  
  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.

  If I might teach thee wit better it were,
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
  No news but health from their physicians know.

  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.



                     150
  O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
  With insufficiency my heart to sway,
  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  O though I love what others do abhor,
  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.



                     151
  Love is too young to know what conscience is,  
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.



                     152
  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,  
  When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.



                     153
  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
  A dateless lively heat still to endure,
  And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,  
  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
  I sick withal the help of bath desired,
  And thither hied a sad distempered guest.

 What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?

 A fistula, my lord.
 I heard not of it before.
 I would it were not notorious.
 No
    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
    you affect a sorrow than to have-
  HELENA.
 Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend  
    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
    But never tax'd for speech.

 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
 I love him for his sake;
    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;  
    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
    That they take place when virtue's steely bones
    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
 Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
 Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
  PAROLLES.
 Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown  
    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
     made, you lose your city.
 That you were made of is metal to make virgins.
 Virginity breeds mites, much like a
    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
    feeding his own stomach.

    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly  
    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse.

    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
    the less worth.

 I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely.
 The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;

 So 'tis reported, sir.
 We here receive it,
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,

    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he

 Well, now.

 Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.

 I play the noble housewife with the time,

 O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.

 So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.

 I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my

 No better, if you please.

  LAFEU.

    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.

  KING.
 That is honour's scorn
    Which challenges itself as honour's born
    And is not like the sire.
 The mere word's a slave,
    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour'd bones indeed.
 What should be said?
    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
    I can create the rest.

  KING.
 Check thy contempt;
    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
    Without all terms of pity.

  KING.

 Good fortune and the favour of the King

  LAFEU.
 Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
 Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  LAFEU.
 What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
 Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden.
 I
    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
    worth.

  PAROLLES.

  PAROLLES.
 My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

  PAROLLES.
 The devil it is that's thy master.
 By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat  
    thee.
 Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
    beat thee.

  BERTRAM.
 Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
    I will not bed her.
 O my Parolles, they have married me!
    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
 France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
    The tread of a man's foot.
 Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?

Paris.
 Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
    out his master's undoing.

  PAROLLES.
 Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
    me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
    laughter.

  HELENA.
 That, having this obtain'd, you presently
    Attend his further pleasure.

 Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.

 I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
    cannot yet find in my heart to repent.
 Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
    very good tailor.

  LAFEU.
  
  BERTRAM.

  LAFEU.
 An idle lord, I swear.
 Why, do you not know him?
  BERTRAM.
 I shall obey his will.
 This drives me to entreat you
    That presently you take your way for home,
    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
    For my respects are better than they seem,
    And my appointments have in them a need
    Greater than shows itself at the first view
    To you that know them not.
 This to my mother.

  HELENA.
 Sir, I can nothing say
    But that I am your most obedient servant.

  SECOND LORD.

  DUKE.
 You know your places well;
    When better fall, for your avails they fell.
 Flourish.

Rousillon.
 By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
    man.
 By what observance, I pray you?
  CLOWN.

                                              [Opening a letter]
  CLOWN.
 I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court.
 Our old ling
    and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
    your Isbels o' th' court.
 The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
    and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

  COUNTESS.
 What have we here?
  CLOWN.
 I have wedded her, not bedded
    her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal.
  
  COUNTESS.
 Why should he be kill'd?
  CLOWN.
 So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
    the getting of children.
 Save you, good madam.

  HELENA.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.
"
    This is a dreadful sentence.

  COUNTESS.
 Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Ay, madam;
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
 He was my son;
    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
    And thou art all my child.
'
    'Tis bitter.
 Ay, madam.

  COUNTESS.
 Nothing in France until he have no wife!
    There's nothing here that is too good for him
    But only she; and she deserves a lord
    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
    And call her hourly mistress.

  COUNTESS.

    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
    To tell him that his sword can never win
    The honour that he loses.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.

    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected.
 No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all.

    My being here it is that holds thee hence.

    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all.
 Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,
drum and trumpets

  DUKE.
 Sir, it is
    A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
    To th' extreme edge of hazard.

ACT III.
 Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
    As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
    I could have well diverted her intents,
    Which thus she hath prevented.

  COUNTESS.
 Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light.
 My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
 SCENE 5.
 They say the French count has done most honourable service.

  WIDOW.
  [Tucket]
    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way.

  MARIANA.
 Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
    report of it.
 I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl.
 I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.


            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim

  WIDOW.
 I hope so.
 Look, here comes a pilgrim.

    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
  WIDOW.
 Is this the way?

    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
    The rather for I think I know your hostess
    As ample as myself.
 He stole from France,
    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him  
    Against his liking.
 Think you it is so?
  HELENA.
 Monsieur Parolles.


    Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
                          whole ARMY

  MARIANA.
 So, now they come.

    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
    That, Escalus.

  HELENA.

  PAROLLES.
 Of enjoin'd penitents
    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
    Already at my house.

  BERTRAM.
 Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
    lordship's entertainment.
 I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise  
    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.

    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
    we bring him to our own tents.

  BERTRAM.

  FIRST LORD.
 Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.

 Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
    so seriously he does address himself unto?

 You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
    not for your lordship's respect.

    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu.
 Your brother, he shall go along with me.

 SCENE 7.
 If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
    I know not how I shall assure you further
    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

  HELENA.
 The Count he woos your daughter
    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
    Resolv'd to carry her.

    Now his important blood will nought deny
    That she'll demand.

  WIDOW.

  WIDOW.
 I have yielded.
 Every night he comes
    With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
    To her unworthiness.
 It nothing steads us
    To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
    As if his life lay on 't.
 Why then to-night
    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.

  SECOND LORD.
 Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
  FIRST SOLDIER.
 This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
    guilty of.
 Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
    he is?

 Captain, I will.

  BERTRAM.
 So should you be.

  DIANA.

  BERTRAM.

    I was compell'd to her; but I love the
    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all rights of service.

  DIANA.
 Ay, so you serve us
    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
    And mock us with our bareness.
 Change it, change it;
    Be not so holy-cruel.
 Say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it begins shall so persever.
 I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
    To give it from me.
 It is an honour 'longing to our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
    In me to lose.
 Mine honour's such a ring:
    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world  
    In me to lose.
 Thus your own proper wisdom
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
    Against your vain assault.
 When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
 You have won
    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

    My mother told me just how he would woo,
    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
    Have the like oaths.
 There is something
    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
    almost into another man.
 I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
    with you.

  FIRST LORD.

  SECOND LORD.
 Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
  FIRST LORD.
 Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
 I would gladly have him see his
    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own
    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.

  SECOND LORD.
 How is this justified?
  SECOND LORD.
 I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
 And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.

    Here's his lordship now.

  SECOND LORD.
 I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

  FIRST SOLDIER.

  PAROLLES.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Shall I set down your answer so?
  PAROLLES.
 Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you
    will.
 Well, that's set down.
 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.
  
  BERTRAM.
 'You shall demand of him
    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.
' What say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  PAROLLES.
 Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  
  SECOND LORD.
 What is his reputation with the Duke?
  PAROLLES.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Marry, we'll search.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 Shall I read it to you?
  PAROLLES.

  BERTRAM.
 I pray you, sir, put it up
    again.
 He will lie,
    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.

  SECOND LORD.

  BERTRAM.
 A pox on him! he's a cat still.
 What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
  FIRST LORD.
 In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
    in coming on he has the cramp.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 A plague of all drums!
    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.
 Come, headsman, of with his head.
 Good morrow, noble Captain.
 God save you, noble Captain.
 If you could find out a country where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent  
    nation.
 Gentle madam,
    You never had a servant to whose trust
    Your business was more welcome.

    But more of this hereafter.
 Yet, I pray you:
    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
    And be as sweet as sharp.

    Upon a tawny front.
 Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
                    with eunuchs fanning her

    Look where they come!
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd  
    Into a strumpet's fool.
 If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

  ANTONY.
 Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

  ANTONY.
'
  ANTONY.
 How, my love?
  CLEOPATRA.
 As I am Egypt's Queen,
    Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
    Is Caesar's homager.
 Else so thy cheek pays shame
    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds.
 The messengers!
  ANTONY.
 The nobleness of life
    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet
    We stand up peerless.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Excellent falsehood!
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
    I'll seem the fool I am not.
 But stirr'd by Cleopatra.

    No messenger but thine, and all alone
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
    The qualities of people.
 Speak not to us.
 Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
  PHILO.
 Rest you happy!            Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  SOOTHSAYER.

  SOOTHSAYER.

  IRAS.
 Let me have a
    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage.

  SOOTHSAYER.
 You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
 You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
    Than that which is to approach.

  CHARMIAN.

  CHARMIAN.
 I have said.
 Not in my husband's nose.
 Therefore,
    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
  CHARMIAN.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Where's Alexas?
  ALEXAS.
 Ay.
 'Tis thus:
    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
    I hear him as he flatter'd.
 From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
  FIRST ATTENDANT.
 The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
  SECOND ATTENDANT.
 He stays upon your will.

  ANTONY.
 Let him appear.
 Where died she?
  SECOND MESSENGER.
 Cleopatra, catching but
    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die  
    twenty times upon far poorer moment.
 I do think there is mettle
    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
    celerity in dying.
 This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
    makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
 O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
    your travel.

  ENOBARBUS.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
 When it
    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it  
    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new.
 If
    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
    and the case to be lamented.

  ANTONY.
 No more light answers.
 Much is breeding
    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
    And not a serpent's poison.

  ENOBARBUS.
 I shall do't.
                                Exeunt




SCENE III.

Alexandria.
 Where is he?
  CHARMIAN.

    I did not send you.
 If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
    That I am sudden sick.
 Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.

  ANTONY.
 I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
  CLEOPATRA.

  ANTONY.

    Would she had never given you leave to come!
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
    I have no power upon you; hers you are.

  ANTONY.
 When you sued staying,
    Then was the time for words.
 How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA.
 Our Italy  
    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
    Equality of two domestic powers
    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
    Are newly grown to love.
 My more particular,
    And that which most with you should safe my going,
    Is Fulvia's death.
 Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
     It does from childishness.

  CLEOPATRA.

  ANTONY.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Good now, play one scene
    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
    Like perfect honour.

  CLEOPATRA.
 And target.

    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.

    That you know well.
 Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat.
 If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    It hath been taught us from the primal state
    That he which is was wish'd until he were;
    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
    Comes dear'd by being lack'd.
 Antony,
    Leave thy lascivious wassails.
 When thou once
    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
    Though daintily brought up, with patience more
    Than savages could suffer.
 'Tis time we twain
    Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
    Assemble we immediate council.

  LEPIDUS.
 Ha, ha!
    Give me to drink mandragora.
 'Tis well for thee
    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
    May not fly forth of Egypt.
 Indeed?
  MARDIAN.
 O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men.
 How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
    Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
    With his tinct gilded thee.
 Last thing he did, dear Queen,
    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
    This orient pearl.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.

    Why do you send so thick?
  CLEOPATRA.
  
    Welcome, my good Alexas.
'
  CHARMIAN.
 By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but after you.

  CLEOPATRA.
  PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANY
SERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.
 If the great gods be just, they shall assist
    The deeds of justest men.
 I shall do well.
 Lepidus flatters both,
    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
    Nor either cares for him.

  MENAS.
 A mighty strength they carry.
 From Silvius, sir.
 This is most certain that I shall deliver:
    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
    Expected.
 Menas, I did not think
    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
    For such a petty war; his soldiership
    Is twice the other twain.
 I know not, Menas,
    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.

    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.

Rome.
 'Tis not a time
    For private stomaching.
 Every time
    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

  LEPIDUS.

  LEPIDUS.
 Here comes  
    The noble Antony.
 And yonder, Caesar.

    Hark, Ventidius.

  LEPIDUS.
  
  ANTONY.
                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY.
 My being in Egypt, Caesar,
    What was't to you?
  CAESAR.
 No more than my residing here at Rome
    Might be to you in Egypt.

  ANTONY.
 You do mistake your business; my brother never
    Did urge me in his act.
 You praise yourself
    By laying defects of judgment to me; but
    You patch'd up your excuses.
  
  ANTONY.
 So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
    Did you too much disquiet.
 No;
    Lepidus, let him speak.
 To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
    The which you both denied.
 As nearly as I may,
    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
    Work without it.
 Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.

    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
    do.
 Speak no more.
 You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
 I do not much dislike the matter, but
    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
    So diff'ring in their acts.

  CAESAR.

    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
    Were well deserv'd of rashness.
 Let me hear
    Agrippa further speak.
 To hold you in perpetual amity,  
    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
    No worse a husband than the best of men;
    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
    That which none else can utter.

    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
    Did ever love so dearly.
 Happily, amen!
  ANTONY.

  LEPIDUS.
 Time calls upon's.
  
  ENOBARBUS.
 Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
    twelve persons there.
 She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.

    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water.
 On each side her
    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
    And what they undid did.

  AGRIPPA.
 O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS.
 At the helm
    A seeming mermaid steers.
 The silken tackle
    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
    That yarely frame the office.
 From the barge
    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
    Of the adjacent wharfs.

  AGRIPPA.
 Royal wench!
    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.

  MAECENAS.

  ENOBARBUS.

    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety.
 Other women cloy
    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
    Bless her when she is riggish.
 If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
    A blessed lottery to him.
                    Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Good night, sir.
 My Octavia,
    Read not my blemishes in the world's report.

  OCTAVIA.
 If you can- your reason.

  ANTONY.
 Say to me,
    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
  SOOTHSAYER.

    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.

  SOOTHSAYER.
 I say again, thy spirit
    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
    But, he away, 'tis noble.

  ANTONY.
 Get thee gone.
 The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance.
 Your commission's ready;
    Follow me and receive't.
 Pray you hasten
    Your generals after.
 Sir, good success!
  LEPIDUS.
 The music, ho!

                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch

  CLEOPATRA.

  CHARMIAN.
 As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
    As with a woman.
 Come, you'll play with me, sir?
  MARDIAN.
 I'll none now.
'
  CHARMIAN.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Why, there's more gold.
 Bring it to that,
    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
    Down thy ill-uttering throat.

  MESSENGER.
 Well, go to, I will.

    But there's no goodness in thy face.

  MESSENGER.

  MESSENGER.

  MESSENGER.
 Make thee a fortune from me.
 I do not like 'but yet.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.
             Exit
  CHARMIAN.

    Though I am mad, I will not bite him.

    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
    Thou wouldst appear most ugly.
 Take no offence that I would not offend you;
    To punish me for what you make me do
    Seems much unequal.
 Good your Highness, patience.

  CHARMIAN.
 O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
 Bring me word quickly.
 Lead me to my chamber.

  ANTONY.
 That's our offer.

  LEPIDUS.

  POMPEY.
 Thus we are agreed.
 And fair words to them.
 Well;
    And well am like to do, for I perceive
    Four feasts are toward.

    I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
    When I have envied thy behaviour.

  POMPEY.
- You and I have known, sir.
 We have, sir.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Nor what I have done by water.

  ENOBARBUS.
 There I deny my land service.
 But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
 For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
 If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.

  MENAS.
 But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
 'Tis true.

  MENAS.
 Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.

  FIRST SERVANT.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.

  ANTONY.
 [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
  MENAS.
 [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
      Captain,
    And hear me speak a word.

  POMPEY.
 Of it own colour too.
 'Tis a strange serpent.
 But entertain it,  
    And though you think me poor, I am the man
    Will give thee all the world.
 No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.

  MENAS.
 Let me cut the cable;
    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
 Thou must know
    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
    Mine honour, it.
 Being done unknown,
    I should have found it afterwards well done,
    But must condemn it now.
 Bear him ashore.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Why?
  ENOBARBUS.
 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
  MENAS.
 It ripens towards it.

  CAESAR.

               [Music plays.
 What would you more? Pompey, good night.
 Good brother,
    Let me request you off; our graver business
    Frowns at this levity.
 Strong Enobarb
    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
    Splits what it speaks.
 O Antony,  
    You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
 Take heed you fall not.
 No, to my cabin.

    Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
    Than gain which darkens him.
 Rome.

  AGRIPPA.

  ENOBARBUS.
 O, how he loves Caesar!
  AGRIPPA.
 Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
  ENOBARBUS.
 O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
  ENOBARBUS.

    Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot  
    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
    His love to Antony.
 They are his shards, and he their beetle.

  AGRIPPA.
 You take from me a great part of myself;
    Use me well in't.
 Make me not offended
    In your distrust.
 You shall not find,
    Though you be therein curious, the least cause
    For what you seem to fear.
 Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
 Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-
  CAESAR.

  ENOBARBUS.

  ENOBARBUS.
 [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
      horse;
    So is he, being a man.
 [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
 Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]
  ANTONY.


                Enter the MESSENGER as before

    Come hither, sir.
 Madam, in Rome
    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
    Between her brother and Mark Antony.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
  MESSENGER.
 Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.

  CLEOPATRA.
 He cannot like her long.

  CLEOPATRA.
 She creeps.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Or I have no observance.
 He's very knowing;
    I do perceive't.

    Her hair, what colour?
  MESSENGER.
 Go make thee ready;
    Our letters are prepar'd.
 Why, methinks, by him,
    This creature's no such thing.

  CHARMIAN.
 Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
    And serving you so long!
  CLEOPATRA.

  CHARMIAN.
 O my good lord,
    Believe not all; or if you must believe,
    Stomach not all.
 A more unhappy lady,
    If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
    Praying for both parts.
 Provide your going;
    Choose your own company, and command what cost
    Your heart has mind to.
 Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Our great navy's rigg'd.
                                        Exeunt

ACT_3|SC_6
                          SCENE VI.
 CAESAR'S house

             Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS

  CAESAR.

  MAECENAS.
 I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
 Let Rome be thus
    Inform'd.

  CAESAR.
 Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
    Like Caesar's sister.
 Good my lord,
    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
    On my free will.
 My lord, Mark Antony,
    Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
    His pardon for return.
 Do not say so, my lord.

    Where is he now?
  OCTAVIA.
 My lord, in Athens.
  
  CAESAR.
 He hath assembled
    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
    More larger list of sceptres.

  OCTAVIA.
 Best of comfort,
    And ever welcome to us.

  MAECENAS.
 But why, why,
  CLEOPATRA.
 Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
    And say'st it is not fit.
 Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
    Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
    What should not then be spar'd.
 He is already
    Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids  
    Manage this war.
 Speak not against it;
    I will not stay behind.
 Nay, I have done.

    Here comes the Emperor.
 For that he dares us to't.

  ENOBARBUS.

  CANIDIUS.
 But these offers,
    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
    And so should you.
 I'll fight at sea.
 But if we fail,
    We then can do't at land.


                       Enter a MESSENGER

    Thy business?
  MESSENGER.
 O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
    Trust not to rotten planks.

  CANIDIUS.

  SOLDIER.
 You keep by land
    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?  
  CANIDIUS.

  SOLDIER.
 While he was yet in Rome,
    His power went out in such distractions as
    Beguil'd all spies.
 Well I know the man.
 Taurus!
  TAURUS.
 The greater cantle of the world is lost
    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away  
    Kingdoms and provinces.
 She once being loof'd,
    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.

  ENOBARBUS.
 Alack, alack!  

                       Enter CANIDIUS

  CANIDIUS.

  CANIDIUS.

    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting.
 Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims.
 To the sea-side straight way.
 No, no, no, no, no.

    Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
    Your comfort makes the rescue.

  ANTONY.
 O'er my spirit
    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
    Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
    Command me.

  CLEOPATRA.
 O, my pardon!
  ANTONY.
 Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
    All that is won and lost.
         Exeunt

ACT_3|SC_12

  EUPHRONIUS.

  CAESAR.
 This for him.

    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
    Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
    Now hazarded to thy grace.
 Fortune pursue thee!
  CAESAR.
           Exit EUPHRONIUS
    [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time.
 Dispatch;
    From Antony win Cleopatra.

ACT_3|SC_13
                           SCENE XIII.

  ANTONY.
 Follow me.
 [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike.
 What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
    That kneel'd unto the buds.

    The loyalty well held to fools does make
    Our faith mere folly.
 Caesar's will?
  THYREUS.
 Hear it apart.

  THYREUS.

  ENOBARBUS.

    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
    Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
    Further than he is Caesar.

  ENOBARBUS.
 It much would please him
    That of his fortunes you should make a staff
    To lean upon.
 Tell him I am prompt
    To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.

  THYREUS.
 'Tis your noblest course.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Your Caesar's father oft,
    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
    As it rain'd kisses.
 Favours, by Jove that thunders!  
    What art thou, fellow?
  THYREUS.
 One that but performs
    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
    To have command obey'd.


                       Enter servants

    Take hence this Jack and whip him.
 Moon and stars!
    Whip him.

  THYMUS.
 Mark Antony-
  ANTONY.
 Tug him away.
 Ha!
    Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
    Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
    And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
    By one that looks on feeders?
  CLEOPATRA.

    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
    O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
    In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
    Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
    To our confusion.

  CLEOPATRA.
 O, is't come to this?  
  ANTONY.
 Wherefore is this?
  ANTONY.
 To let a fellow that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to proclaim it civilly were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.
 Soundly, my lord.
 Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was.
 He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell.
 If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom  
    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me.
 Urge it thou.
 To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
    With one that ties his points?
  CLEOPATRA.
 I am satisfied.

    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.

  CLEOPATRA.

    I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
 Call all his noble captains to my lord.
 Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet.
     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  ENOBARBUS.
 Caesar must think
    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
    Even to falling.
 Why should he not?
  ENOBARBUS.
 [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which
      sorrow shoots
    Out of the mind.

  ANTONY.
 And thou art honest too.

  SERVANT.

    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
    And the gods yield you for't!
  ENOBARBUS.
 For shame!
    Transform us not to women.
 Ho, ho, ho!
    Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
    Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
    You take me in too dolorous a sense;
    For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
    To burn this night with torches.
 To-morrow is the day.

  SECOND SOLDIER.
 It will determine one way.

    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  FIRST SOLDIER.
 What news?
  SECOND SOLDIER.
 Belike 'tis but a rumour.
 Well, sir, good night.

                [The two companies separate and place themselves
                                   in every corner of the stage]
  SECOND SOLDIER.

  THIRD SOLDIER.
 Under the earth.

  THIRD SOLDIER.
 Content.

               Alexandria.
 No, my chuck.
 Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!

                   Enter EROS with armour

    Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.
 Sooth, la, I'll help.
 Briefly, sir.
 Rarely, rarely!
    He that unbuckles this, till we do please
    To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
 O love,
    That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
    The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
    A workman in't.


                   Enter an armed SOLDIER

    Good-morrow to thee.
 Good morrow, General.
 'Tis well blown, lads.

    So, so.

    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
 You that will fight,
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't.
 Well, on.
                      Exeunt

ACT_4|SC_5
                          SCENE V.
 ANTONY'S camp

        Trumpets sound.

  ANTONY.
 Sir,
    He is with Caesar.

  EROS.
 Most certain.
 Write to him-
    I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;
    Say that I wish he never find more cause
    To change a master.
 CAESAR'S camp

       Flourish.
 Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
 Caesar, I shall.
                                 Exit
  CAESAR.
 Antony
    Is come into the field.

  CAESAR.
 For this pains
    Casaer hath hang'd him.
 Canidius and the rest
    That fell away have entertainment, but
    No honourable trust.
 I have done ill,
    Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
    That I will joy no more.
                                 Exit
  ENOBARBUS.
 I am alone the villain of the earth,
    And feel I am so most.
                             Exeunt

          Alarums.
 I had a wound here that was like a T,
    But now 'tis made an H.
 They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
    For a fair victory.

    'Tis sport to maul a runner.

  ANTONY.
                              Exeunt

ACT_4|SC_8
                         SCENE VIII.
 Enter ANTONY, again in a march; SCARUS
                        with others

  ANTONY.
 Run one before
    And let the Queen know of our gests.
 Mine nightingale,
    We have beat them to their beds.

  CLEOPATRA.
 I'll give thee, friend,
    An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

  ANTONY.
 Let's speak to him.
 Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
    May concern Caesar.

  SECOND WATCH.
 The hand of death hath raught him.
 Let us bear him
    To th' court of guard; he is of note.
                     Exeunt with the body

ACT_4|SC_10
                          SCENE X.
 But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
    Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
    Is forth to man his galleys.
 I'll bring thee word
    Straight how 'tis like to go.

    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder  
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost.

    What, Eros, Eros!
  
                      Enter CLEOPATRA

    Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
  CLEOPATRA.
 To th' monument!
    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
    Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
    And word it, prithee, piteously.
 Ay, my lord.
 That which is now a horse, even with a thought
    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
    As water is in water.

  ANTONY.

  MARDIAN.
 The last she spake
    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
    The name of Antony; it was divided
    Between her heart and lips.

    Eros!- I come, my queen.
 The gods withhold me!
    Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
    Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
  ANTONY.
 Eros,
    Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
    His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
    His baseness that ensued?
  EROS.
  
    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
    Most useful for thy country.
 O, sir, pardon me!
  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.
 Now, Eros.

  EROS.
                            [Kills himself
  ANTONY.
 My queen and Eros
    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
    A nobleness in record.
 Come, then; and, Eros,
    Thy master dies thy scholar.
 The star is fall'n.

  FIRST GUARD.
 Nor any one.
                         Exeunt guard
  DERCETAS.

    This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
    Shall enter me with him.


                       Enter DIOMEDES

  DIOMEDES.
 Lives he?
    Wilt thou not answer, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
  ANTONY.
 Where is she?
  DIOMEDES.
 Most heavy day!
  ANTONY.

                   Alexandria.
 His death's upon him, but not dead.
 O sun,
    Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
    The varying shore o' th' world.
 So it should be, that none but Antony
    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
  ANTONY.
 Not th' imperious show
    Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
    Be brooch'd with me.
 But come, come, Antony-
    Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
    Assist, good friends.
 O, quick, or I am gone.

    Quicken with kissing.
 Had my lips that power,
    Thus would I wear them out.

  ANTONY.
 The miserable change now at my end
    Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
    In feeding them with those my former fortunes
    Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
    The noblest; and do now not basely die,
    Not cowardly put off my helmet to
    My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
    Valiantly vanquish'd.
 It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;  
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel.

    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us.
 Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
 SCENE I.
 Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
    Appear thus to us?
  DERCETAS.
 I am call'd Dercetas;
    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
    Best to be serv'd.
 If thou please
    To take me to thee, as I was to him
    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,  
    I yield thee up my life.
 I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
 The round world
    Should have shook lions into civil streets,
    And citizens to their dens.
 He is dead, Caesar,
    Not by a public minister of justice,
    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
    Which writ his honour in the acts it did
    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
    Splitted the heart.
  
  AGRIPPA.
 A rarer spirit never
    Did steer humanity.
 I must perforce
    Have shown to thee such a declining day
    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
    In the whole world.
 Go,
    And with your speediest bring us what she says,
    And how you find her.
 Gallus, go you along.
                      Exit GALLUS
    Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?
  ALL.
 Dolabella!
  CAESAR.

    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
    How hardly I was drawn into this war,
    How calm and gentle I proceeded still
    In all my writings.
 The monument

      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

  CLEOPATRA.


       Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,
                          and soldiers

  PROCULEIUS.
 Antony
    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
    I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
    That have no use for trusting.
 Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
    Reliev'd, but not betray'd.
  
  CLEOPATRA.
 Know, sir, that I
    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
    Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
    Of dull Octavia.
 So, Dolabella,
    It shall content me best.
 I cannot tell.
 Assuredly you know me.

  CLEOPATRA.
 I understand not, madam.
 His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
    A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
    The little O, the earth.

  DOLABELLA.
 For his bounty,
    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
    That grew the more by reaping.
 In his livery
    Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Nature wants stuff
    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
    An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
    Condemning shadows quite.

  DOLABELLA.
 He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
  DOLABELLA.
 I know't.
 Which is the Queen of Egypt?
  DOLABELLA.
 It is the Emperor, madam.

  CAESAR.
 Sole sir o' th' world,
    I cannot project mine own cause so well
    To make it clear, but do confess I have
    Been laden with like frailties which before
    Have often sham'd our sex.
 Cleopatra, know
    We will extenuate rather than enforce.

    If you apply yourself to our intents-
    Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
    A benefit in this change; but if you seek
    To lay on me a cruelty by taking
    Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
    Of my good purposes, and put your children
    To that destruction which I'll guard them from,  
    If thereon you rely.
 Here, my good lord.

  CLEOPATRA.
 Speak the truth, Seleucus.

  SELEUCUS.

  CLEOPATRA.

    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
    Even make me wild.
 O slave, of no more trust
    Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
    Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
    Though they had wings.

  CLEOPATRA.

  CAESAR.
 Therefore be cheer'd;
    Make not your thoughts your prisons.
  
    Our care and pity is so much upon you
    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
 Exeunt CAESAR and his train
  CLEOPATRA.
 Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
    And we are for the dark.

  CLEOPATRA.


                      Re-enter DOLABELLA

  DOLABELLA.
                Exit DOLABELLA
    Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
    Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
    In Rome as well as I.
 The gods forbid!  
  CLEOPATRA.

  IRAS.
 Go fetch  
    My best attires.

                                       Exit IRAS.
 Here is a rural fellow
    That will not be denied your Highness' presence.

    He brings you figs.
                     Exit GUARDSMAN
    What poor an instrument
    May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
 Avoid, and leave him.

  CLOWN.
 Ay, ay; farewell.

  CLOWN.
 Very good.

  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA.
         Exit

             Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.

    Yare, yare, good Iras; quick.

    Now to that name my courage prove my title!
    I am fire and air; my other elements
    I give to baser life.

    Farewell, kind Charmian.
 Dost thou lie still?
    If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world  
    It is not worth leave-taking.
 Poor venomous fool,
    Be angry and dispatch.
 As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
    O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:  
                               [Applying another asp to her arm]
    What should I stay-                                   [Dies]
  CHARMIAN.

  FIRST GUARD.
 I partly feel thee.
 Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
 All dead.
 Thyself art coming
    To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
    So sought'st to hinder.
 Bravest at the last,
    She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
    Took her own way.

    This was his basket.

  CAESAR.
 O noble weakness!
    If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
    By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
    As she would catch another Antony
    In her strong toil of grace.

  DOLABELLA.
 Take up her bed,
    And bear her women from the monument.

    She shall be buried by her Antony;
    No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
    A pair so famous.
 High events as these
    Strike those that make them; and their story is
    No less in pity than his glory which
    Brought them to be lamented.

 This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of

    this servitude.

  ADAM.
                                           [ADAM retires]
  OLIVER.
 Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
    prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
  OLIVER.
 O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
 Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
 He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
    a father begot villains.
 [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

  ORLANDO.
 My father
    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have  
    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
    gentleman-like qualities.
 Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.

  OLIVER.

  OLIVER.
 She is at
    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.

  OLIVER.
 I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
    me to try a fall.
 To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
 And so, God keep your worship!

  ROSALIND.

  CELIA.
 Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
    love thee.
 If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
    uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I
    could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
    as mine is to thee.
 Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.

  CELIA.
 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
    ill-favouredly.

  ROSALIND.
 Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
 Mistress, you must come away to your father.

  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
 But if you
    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
    that mustard.
 One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
 By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
    makes a great show.
 With his mouth full of news.
 Then shall we be news-cramm'd.

  CELIA.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  LE BEAU.
 There comes an old man and his three sons-
  CELIA.
 You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
 Speak to
    him, ladies; see if you can move him.
 Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
  ORLANDO.

  CELIA.
 Shout]
  FREDERICK.
 No more, no more.

  FREDERICK.

  FREDERICK.
 What is thy name, young man?
  ORLANDO.
 I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
    His youngest son- and would not change that calling
    To be adopted heir to Frederick.

  ROSALIND.
 Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.

  CELIA.
 Will you go, coz?
  ROSALIND.

                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
  ORLANDO.
 Albeit you have deserv'd
    High commendation, true applause, and love,
    Yet such is now the Duke's condition
    That he misconstrues all that you have done.

  ORLANDO.

    But I can tell you that of late this Duke
    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,  
    Grounded upon no other argument
    But that the people praise her for her virtues
    And pity her for her good father's sake;
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    Will suddenly break forth.

The DUKE's palace

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

  CELIA.
 They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
    will catch them.
  
  CELIA.
 But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
    good earnest.
 Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
    By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.

  CELIA.

  FREDERICK.

    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  
  ROSALIND.
 She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
    Her very silence and her patience,  
    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
 She robs thee of thy name;
    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
    When she is gone.
 Then open not thy lips.
 You, niece, provide yourself.

    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
    And in the greatness of my word, you die.

    Prithee be cheerful.
 Know'st thou not the Duke
    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
  ROSALIND.

    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
    No; let my father seek another heir.
 Alas, what danger will it be to us,
    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
 Now go we in content
    To liberty, and not to banishment.
                    Exeunt

 Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
    More free from peril than the envious court?
    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
    The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
    'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
    That feelingly persuade me what I am.
'
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,  
    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
 Indeed, my lord,
    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 Wherefore do you look
    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
    Thus most invectively he pierceth through
    The body of the country, city, court,
    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
    Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
    To fright the animals, and to kill them up
    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
 I'll bring you to him straight.
 I cannot hear of any that did see her.

  FREDERICK.

Before OLIVER'S house

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting

  ORLANDO.

    This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
 Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
  ADAM.
 What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
    Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
    A thievish living on the common road?
    This I must do, or know not what to do;
    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.

  ADAM.

    At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
    But at fourscore it is too late a week;
    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE

  ROSALIND.
 O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
  TOUCHSTONE.

  ROSALIND.
 Well,.

  SILVIUS.
 Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
    I have by hard adventure found mine own.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
    sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
    Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
    cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember
    the wooing of  peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
    and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
    for my sake.
 Who calls?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

  ROSALIND.

  CORIN.


  JAQUES.

  JAQUES.
 My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
 More at your request than to please myself.

  JAQUES.
 He is to
    disputable for my company.

           Here shall he see
           No enemy
           But winter and rough weather.
 I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
    despite of my invention.
 And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.

                                                Exeunt severally




SCENE VI.
 Yet thou
    liest in the bleak air.

The forest

A table set out.


                         Enter JAQUES

  FIRST LORD.
 He saves my labour by his own approach.
 A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
    A motley fool.
 Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
 Of what kind should this cock come of?
  DUKE SENIOR.
 Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
  ORLANDO.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

  DUKE SENIOR.

  ORLANDO.

  DUKE SENIOR.
 Go find him out.
 Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
    This wide and universal theatre
    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
    Wherein we play in.
 At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail  
    Unwillingly to school.

  ADAM.

  DUKE SENIOR.

            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
              This life is most jolly.

    Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
 I am the Duke
    That lov'd your father.
 Give me your hand,
    And let me all your fortunes understand.
 SCENE I.
 But look to it:
    Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
    Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
    To seek a living in our territory.
 O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
    I never lov'd my brother in my life.

  FREDERICK.

    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
    That every eye which in this forest looks
    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 No, truly.
 Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
    one side.

  CORIN.
 Those that are good manners at the
    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
    country is most mockable at the court.
 Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,
    shallow.

  CORIN.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  CORIN.
 Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God
    make incision in thee! thou art raw.

              All the pictures fairest lin'd
              Are but black to Rosalinde.

  ROSALIND.

                If the cat will after kind,  
                So be sure will Rosalinde.

  ROSALIND.

  CELIA.
 Orlando.
 Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
    What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
    Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
    remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
    again? Answer me in one word.
 It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the  
    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
    relish it with good observance.

  ROSALIND.
 It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
    such fruit.

  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
 And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
    for your society.

  JAQUES.
 God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
 I do desire we may be better strangers.

  JAQUES.

  JAQUES.
 Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO.

  ORLANDO.
 What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO.

  JAQUES.

  JAQUES.
 Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
    our mistress the world, and all our misery.
 I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
    whom I know most faults.
 The worst fault you have is to be in love.
 I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
    Melancholy.
- Do you hear,
    forester?
  ORLANDO.
 Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND.
 And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
    proper?
  ROSALIND.
 By no means, sir.
 I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
    trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
    withal.

  ORLANDO.

  ORLANDO.
 With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
    the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

  ORLANDO.
 Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in  
    so removed a dwelling.
  
  ORLANDO.
 A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
    a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
 But you are no such man; you
    are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
    than seeming the lover of any other.
 That is one of the points in the which women still give
    the lie to their consciences.
 But, in good sooth, are you he that  
    hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
  ORLANDO.
 Yes, one; and in this manner.
 Will you go?
  ORLANDO.

The forest

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind

  TOUCHSTONE.
 When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
 No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
    be said as lovers they do feign.
 Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE.

  AUDREY.

  AUDREY.
 I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
 [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
 Horns? Even so.

  JAQUES.
 I am
    very glad to see you.

  JAQUES.
 Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
    bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

  JAQUES.
 Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
 Come, sweet Audrey;
    We must be married or we must live in bawdry.

    Farewell, good Master Oliver.

The forest

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

  ROSALIND.
 Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
    do not become a man.
 But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA.
 As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.

    Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.

  CELIA.
 An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

  CELIA.
 Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
 Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
 Not true in love?
  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.
 O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
    goose.
 But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.
 If you will see a pageant truly play'd
    Between the pale complexion of true love
    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
    Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
    If you will mark it.

Another part of the forest

Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

  SILVIUS.

    'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!  
    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.

  PHEBE.

    But, mistress, know yourself.

    Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
 Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
 He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
    in love with my anger.

  ROSALIND.
 If you will know my house,
    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.

    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.

  PHEBE.
 Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS.

  PHEBE.

  PHEBE.
 I would have you.
 So holy and so perfect is my love,
    And I in such a poverty of grace,
    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
    To glean the broken ears after the man
    That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
    A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
 Not very well; but I have met him oft;
    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
    That the old carlot once was master of.

    It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
    But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.

    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS.

The forest

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES

  JAQUES.

  ROSALIND.
 Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
 And your experience makes you sad.
 Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
 Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
 I had
    as lief be woo'd of a snail.
 Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
    his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
  
  CELIA.
 Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
    matter.
 What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND.

    Am not I your Rosalind?  
  ORLANDO.
 The poor world is almost six
    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause.
 But these
    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
    eaten them, but not for love.

  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
 Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
 And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
 Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
    sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us.
 What do you say, sister?
  ORLANDO.
 Pray thee, marry us.

  ROSALIND.
 Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO.
 Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.

  ORLANDO.
 I will
    be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.

  ORLANDO.
 A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
    whither wilt?' ROSALIND.
 And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND.
 Marry, to say she came to seek you there.
 You shall never
    take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
    tongue.
 I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
    with thee again.

  ROSALIND.

  ROSALIND.
 I'll go find a
    shadow, and sigh till he come.

  CELIA.
 Which is he that killed the deer?
  LORD.

  JAQUES.
 Yes, sir.

  JAQUES.


                      Enter SILVIUS

  SILVIUS.
 'Od's my will!
    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
    This is a letter of your own device.

  ROSALIND.
 Come, come, you are a fool,
    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
 Why, she defies me,
    Like Turk to Christian.
 She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
 Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND.
'
  SILVIUS.
 Call you this chiding?
  CELIA.
 Alas, poor shepherd!
  ROSALIND.
 West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.

    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
    There's none within.

  CELIA.
 About his neck
    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
    And with indented glides did slip away
    Into a bush; under which bush's shade
    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    The royal disposition of that beast
    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
 And well he might so do,  
    For well I know he was unnatural.
 But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
  OLIVER.
 Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    Made him give battle to the lioness,
    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
    From miserable slumber I awak'd.

  CELIA.
 'Twas I; but 'tis not I.

    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
    To tell this story, that you might excuse
    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
    Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

                                               [ROSALIND swoons]
  CELIA.
 Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
 Look, he recovers.
 I would I were at home.
 Be of good cheer, youth.
 Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

  CELIA.
 Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.

  ROSALIND.
 I do remember in this shepherd boy
    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

  ORLANDO.

    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,  
    Whom he reports to be a great magician,
    Obscured in the circle of this forest.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
    seventh cause.
 How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  TOUCHSTONE.
 According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
    diseases.

  JAQUES.
 Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
  TOUCHSTONE.
 O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
    books for good manners.
 I will name you the degrees.
 The first,
    the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
    Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
    the seventh, the Lie Direct.
 All these you may avoid but the Lie
    Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If.
 I knew when seven
    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
    met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you  
    said so, then I said so.

DUKE.
 Alas! too soon
  We came aboard.

  And this it was, for other means was none:
  The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
  Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
  To him one of the other twins was bound,
  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.

  Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
  To seek thy help by beneficial hap.

  Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

  This very day a Syracusian merchant
  Is apprehended for arrival here;
  And, not being able to buy out his life,

  Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.

 Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

  'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.

  'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
  'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

  But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA.

  You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
  Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
  My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

  What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
 Because that I familiarly sometimes
  Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
  Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
  And make a common of my serious hours.

  When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.

  If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
  Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
 Shall I tell you why?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
  every why hath a wherefore.
 Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
  For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
 In good time, sir, what's that?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
  another dry basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
  there's a time for all things.
 Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Certain ones, then.
 Name them.
 Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
  hair lost by nature.
 But,
  soft, who wafts us yonder?

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA.

  How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
  That thou art then estranged from thyself?
  Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
  That, undividable, incorporate,
  Am better than thy dear self's better part.

  I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
  My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  For if we two be one, and thou play false,
  I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
  Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
 Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
  Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
 I never spake with her in all my life.

  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
  Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
  Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
  Makes me with thy strength to communicate.

  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
  Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
  Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.

  What, was I married to her in my dream?
  Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
  Until I know this sure uncertainty,
  I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
 O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.

  This is the fairy land.
 O spite of spites!
  We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
 Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
 No, I am an ape.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.

  'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
  But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA.

  Come, sir, to dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
ADRIANA.

  Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

  But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.

  Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
  When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 What patch is made our porter?
  My master stays in the street.
  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
    lest he catch cold on's feet.
  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when,
    an you'll tell me wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;
    come again when you may.
 What art thou that keep'st me out
    from the house I owe?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 O Lord, I must laugh!
  Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
LUCE.
  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
  [Within]  And you said no.
 SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.

LUCE.

ANGELO.
 Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.

  Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;
  It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee let me in.
  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no
    feathers and fish have no fin.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
 You have prevail'd.
  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.

  Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
  For there's the house.
 I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
 And may it be that you have quite forgot
  A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
  Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
  Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
  If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
  Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
  Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
  Let not my sister read it in your eye;
  Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
  Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
  Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
  Be secret-false.
 Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
  Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
  Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.

  Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  The folded meaning of your words' deceit.

  Give me thy hand.

LUCIANA.


ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Thou art Dromio, thou art my
  man, thou art thyself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
'
  I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
  wondrous fat marriage.

  I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
  Poland winter.
 That's a fault that water will mend.
 No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
  could not do it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Then she bears some breadth?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 In what part of her body stands Ireland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
  the bogs.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Where Scotland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
  could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
  chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
 Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
  her breath.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Where America, the Indies?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
  rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
  hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
  ballast at her nose.
 Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  Where I will walk till thou return to me.
 I know it well, sir.

  Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
  And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
  And then receive my money for the chain.
 I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
  For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
 What I should think of this cannot tell:
  But this I think, there's no man is so vain
  That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.

  Therefore make present satisfaction,
  Or I'll attach you by this officer.

ANGELO.

SECOND MERCHANT.
 You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

ANGELO.
 Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
  Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 The money that you owe me for the chain.

SECOND MERCHANT.
 Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

OFFICER.
 This touches me in reputation.
 Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
  To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

  Thither I must, although against my will,
  For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

<Exit


SCENE 2

The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA.
 First he denied you had in him no right.

  First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
 Didst speak him fair?
LUCIANA.

  Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
 No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
 What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
ADRIANA.
 The hours come back! That did I never hear.
 O yes.
 Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
    more than he's worth to season.
 There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
  As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  And every one doth call me by my name.
 What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
  but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the
  calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind
  you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Marry, he must have a long spoon
  that must eat with the devil.
 Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

COURTEZAN.
 Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
  A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
  A nut, a cherry-stone;
  But she, more covetous, would have a chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 Mistress, that you know.

  The reason that I gather he is mad,
  Besides this present instance of his rage,
  Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.

  My way is now to hie home to his house,
  And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
  He rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My ring away.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
  return'd.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 Thou art sensible in nothing but
  blows, and so is an ass.
 When I am cold he heats me with
  beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating.
'
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
ADRIANA.

PINCH.
 There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

  I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
 O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.
 Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
 Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
 And did not she herself revile me there?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
 Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
 Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

ADRIANA.
 O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
 More company! The fiend is strong within him.

PINCH.
 He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
  The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
 Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
 God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
ADRIANA.
 What is the sum he owes?
OFFICER.
 Two hundred ducats.

COURTEZAN.


LUCIANA.

OFFICER.
 I see these witches are afraid of swords.
 She that would be your wife now ran from you.
 Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
  PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANY
SERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.
 How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
ANGELO.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

ANGELO.
 I think I had; I never did deny it.

SECOND MERCHANT.
 Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
 These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory

Enter the LADY ABBESS

ABBESS.

ANGELO.

SECOND MERCHANT.
 I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
 Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
  Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
  Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
  A sin prevailing much in youthful men
  Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.

ABBESS.
 As roughly as my modesty would let me.
 And thereof came it that the man was mad.

  The venom clamours of a jealous woman
  Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
 Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
  And it shall privilege him from your hands
  Till I have brought him to his wits again,
  Or lose my labour in assaying it.
 Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.
 Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
  And never rise until my tears and prayers
  Have won his Grace to come in person hither
  And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
 By this, I think, the dial points at five;
  Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
  The place of death and sorry execution,
  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
 Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
  If any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He shall not die; so much we tender him.
 She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
 May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
  Who I made lord of me and all I had
  At your important letters-this ill day
  A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
  That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
  With him his bondman all as mad as he,
  Doing displeasure to the citizens
  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
 Then they fled
  Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
  And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
  And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
  Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

MESSENGER.

  Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
  And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS.
 Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
  She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
  That hath abused and dishonoured me
  Even in the strength and height of injury.

  Beyond imagination is the wrong
  That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
 So befall my soul
  As this is false he burdens me withal!
LUCIANA.
 Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
  But she tells to your Highness simple truth!
ANGELO.
 O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.

  There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
  That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
  Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
  He did arrest me with an officer.

  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
  For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
 Along with them
  They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
  A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
  A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
  A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
  A living dead man.
 This pernicious slave,
  Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
  And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
  And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
  Cries out I was possess'd.
 My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
  That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
 Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
  Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
  After you first forswore it on the mart;
  And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
  And then you fled into this abbey here,
  From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
 I never came within these abbey walls,
  Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
  I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
  And this is false you burden me withal.

COURTEZAN.
 Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
COURTEZAN.
 Go call the Abbess hither.

  I think you are all mated or stark mad.

AEGEON.
 Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
  For lately we were bound as you are now.

  You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
AEGEON.
 Why look you strange on me? You know me well.

AEGEON.
 I am sure thou dost.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

  I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
 I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
 One of these men is genius to the other;
  And so of these.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 O, my old master! who hath bound
ABBESS.
 Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
  And gain a husband by his liberty.

  Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
 And I with him.
 I, gentle mistress.
 That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

ANGELO.
 I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
 No, none by me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
 Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

ABBESS.
 He speaks to me.

  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

Rome.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
    people.
 Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own
    price.
 Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
  FIRST CITIZEN.
 Very well, and could be content to give him good
    report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.
 What he cannot help in his nature you account a
    vice in him.
  [Shouts  
    within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is
    risen.

  FIRST CITIZEN.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 Alack,
    You are transported by calamity
    Thither where more attends you; and you slander
    The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
    When you curse them as enemies.
 Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
    yet.
 Sir, I shall tell you.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 Your belly's answer- What?
    The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
    With other muniments and petty helps
    Is this our fabric, if that they-
  MENENIUS.
 What then?
    Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?
  FIRST CITIZEN.
 Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
    Who is the sink o' th' body-
  MENENIUS.
 The former agents, if they did complain,
    What could the belly answer?  
  MENENIUS.
 I will tell you;
    If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
    Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.
 And though that all at once
    You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.

  FIRST CITIZEN.
 'Though all at once cannot
    See what I do deliver out to each,
    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
    From me do back receive the flour of all,
    And leave me but the bran.
' What say you to' t?
  FIRST CITIZEN.
 It was an answer.
 Your virtue is
    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
    And curse that justice did it.
 He that depends
    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
    And hews down oaks with rushes.

  MARCIUS.
 Hang 'em!
    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
    Corn for the rich men only.
 What is granted them?
  MARCIUS.
 What's the matter?
  MESSENGER.
 The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

  MENENIUS.
 Nay, let them follow.
 But I do wonder
    His insolence can brook to be commanded
    Under Cominius.

  BRUTUS.
                                    Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Is it not yours?
    What ever have been thought on in this state
    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
    Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
    I have the letter here;.
yes, here it is:
    [Reads]  'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
    Whether for east or west.
'
  FIRST SENATOR.
 Our army's in the field;
    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
    To answer us.

  SECOND SENATOR.

  AUFIDIUS.
 Nay more,
    Some parcels of their power are forth already,  
    And only hitherward.

  ALL.
 Farewell.
 When yet
    he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
    with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
    kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
    beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
    that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
    renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
    he was to find fame.

  VIRGILIA.
 Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
    sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
    good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
    than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

  VOLUMNIA.
 Indeed you shall not.

    Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
    'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
    Though you were born in Rome.
' His bloody brow
    With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
    Or all or lose his hire.


         Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher

  VALERIA.
 My ladies both, good day to you.
 I am glad to see your ladyship.
 I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
 He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look  
    upon his schoolmaster.
 Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

  VIRGILIA.
 No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

  VALERIA.

  VALERIA.
 In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
    of your husband.
 O, good madam, there can be none yet.
 Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
    last night.
 Indeed, madam?
  VALERIA.

  VIRGILIA.
 I wish you much
    mirth.
 They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.

  MARCIUS.

  MARCIUS.
 All the contagion of the south light on you,
    You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
    Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
    Farther than seen, and one infect another
    Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
    That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
    From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
    All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
    With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
    Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
    And make my wars on you.
 Not I.
                    [MARCIUS is shut in]
  FIRST SOLDIER.

  ALL.
 A street

Enter certain Romans, with spoils

  FIRST ROMAN.
 See here these movers that do prize their hours
    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up.
 To Aufidius thus
    I will appear, and fight.
 The citizens of Corioli have issued
    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,
    And then I came away.
 Who's yonder
    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
    He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
    Before-time seen him thus.
 Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
    But mantled in your own.

  COMINIUS.
 As with a man busied about decrees:
    Condemning some to death and some to exile;
    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
    To let him slip at will.

  COMINIUS.
 But for our gentlemen,
    The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
    From rascals worse than they.

  COMINIUS.
 Marcius,
    We have at disadvantage fought, and did
    Retire to win our purpose.

  MARCIUS.
 Though I could wish
    You were conducted to a gentle bath
    And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
    Deny your asking: take your choice of those
    That best can aid your action.
 Fear not our care, sir.
 Hence, and shut your gates upon's.

    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.
       Exeunt




SCENE VIII.

  MARCIUS.


       Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid
        of AUFIDIUS.
 If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
    Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
    Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
    Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
    I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
    And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
    That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
    Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
    Our Rome hath such a soldier.

    Hadst thou beheld-
  MARCIUS.
 You shall not be
    The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
    The value of her own.
 They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
   cast up their caps and lances.
 COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare

    May these same instruments which you profane
    Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
    I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be  
    Made all of false-fac'd soothing.

    Bear th' addition nobly ever!
                           [Flourish.
 Trumpets sound, and drums]
  ALL.
 I will go wash;
    And when my face is fair you shall perceive
    Whether I blush or no.
 Send us to Rome
    The best, with whom we may articulate
    For their own good and ours.
 I, that now
    Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg  
    Of my Lord General.
 Marcius, his name?
  CORIOLANUS.
 By Jupiter, forgot!
    I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
 Cornets.
 The town is ta'en.

  AUFIDIUS.
 Condition?
    What good condition can a treaty find
    I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
    I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
    As often as we eat.
 Bolder, though not so subtle.
 Where I find him, were it
    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
    Against the hospitable canon, would I
    Wash my fierce hand in's heart.

  FIRST SOLDIER.

Rome.
 The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
 Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the
    noble Marcius.
 Well, sir.
 In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
    in abundance?
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?
  BOTH TRIBUNES.
 We do it not alone, sir.

  MENENIUS.
 You talk of
    pride.
 O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
    necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
    that you could!
  BOTH TRIBUNES.
 I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
    a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
    be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
    and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
    with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
    morning.

    Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
    Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
    make a crooked face at it.
 You are
    ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
    wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
    a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
    to a second day of audience.
 All
    the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
    knaves.
 Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
    encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are.
 Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
    cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;  
    though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
    hangmen.
 Ha! Marcius coming home?
  VOLUMNIA.
  
  MENENIUS.
 A letter for me?
  VIRGILIA.
 Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

  VIRGILIA.
 O, no, no, no.
 Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?
  VOLUMNIA.
 Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius
    got off.

  VIRGILIA.
 The gods grant them true!
  VOLUMNIA.
 Where is he wounded?
    [To the TRIBUNES]  God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
    home; he has more cause to be proud.
 One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I
    know.

  VOLUMNIA.
 Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
    Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,
    With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
    In honour follows Coriolanus.

    Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!             [Flourish]
  ALL.
 Look, sir, your mother!  
  CORIOLANUS.
 My gracious silence, hail!
    Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
    That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
    Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
    And mothers that lack sons.
 And live you yet?  [To VALERIA]  O my sweet lady,
    pardon.

  MENENIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.

    Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
    The good patricians must be visited;
    From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,
    But with them change of honours.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Cornets.
 All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
    Are spectacled to see him.

  SICINIUS.

  BRUTUS.
  
  BRUTUS.
 O, he would miss it rather
    Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
    And the desire of the nobles.

  SICINIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 So it must fall out
    To him or our authorities.
 For an end,
    We must suggest the people in what hatred
    He still hath held them; that to's power he would  
    Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
    Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
    In human action and capacity
    Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
    Than camels in their war, who have their provand
    Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
    For sinking under them.

  SICINIUS.
  
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
    The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
    Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
    Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
    As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
    A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.

  BRUTUS.
                                Exeunt




SCENE II.

    Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
    hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
    disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
    see't.

  FIRST OFFICER.

  SECOND OFFICER.


         A sennet.
 Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
         OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS,
            MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul.

                         CORIOLANUS stands

  MENENIUS.

    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
    Rather our state's defective for requital
    Than we to stretch it out.

  MENENIUS.
 Your Honours' pardon.

  BRUTUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 If it be,
    The man I speak of cannot in the world
    Be singly counterpois'd.
 His sword, death's stamp,
    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
    Was tim'd with dying cries.
 Alone he ent'red
    The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
    Corioli like a planet.
 Worthy man!
  FIRST SENATOR.
 The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
    To make thee consul.

  CORIOLANUS.
 I do beseech you
    Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
    Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them
    For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
 Please you
    That I may pass this doing.

  SICINIUS.

    Pray you go fit you to the custom, and
    Take to you, as your predecessors have,
    Your honour with your form.

  BRUTUS.
 You see how he intends to use the people.
 We may, sir, if we will.

  FIRST CITIZEN.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
   melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for
    conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.

    We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
    stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes.

  ALL.
                         Exeunt citizens
  MENENIUS.
 O sir, you are not right; have you not known
    The worthiest men have done't?
  CORIOLANUS.
 O me, the gods!
    You must not speak of that.
 Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
    In wholesome manner.
 So, here comes a brace.

    You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.
 How, not your own desire?
  CORIOLANUS.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
  
  CORIOLANUS.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 But this is something odd.
 I will, sir, flatter my sworn
    brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
    condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
    choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
    the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly.
 We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
    you our voices heartily.
 You have received many wounds for your country.
 I will not seal your knowledge with showing them.

  BOTH CITIZENS.

    Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
    To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
 Rather than fool it so,
    Let the high office and the honour go
    To one that would do thus.
 Worthy voices!

             Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

  MENENIUS.

    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon, upon your approbation.

  CORIOLANUS.
 You may, sir.

  MENENIUS.

  SICINIUS.
 Fare you well.

  BRUTUS.
 Amen, sir.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 He should have show'd us
    His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
 Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
    Either his gracious promise, which you might,  
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
    Which easily endures not article
    Tying him to aught.

  BRUTUS.
 Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
    They have chose a consul that will from them take
    Their liberties, make them of no more voice
    Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
    As therefore kept to do so.
 Enforce his pride
    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
    With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
    Thinking upon his services, took from you
    Th' apprehension of his present portance,
    Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
    After the inveterate hate he bears you.
 Say you ne'er had done't-
    Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
    And presently, when you have drawn your number,
    Repair to th' Capitol.
 will will so; almost all
    Repent in their election.
 To th' Capitol, come.
 Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS,
TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS

  CORIOLANUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
    To oppose his hatred fully.
 Welcome home.
 Pass no further.
 What makes this change?  
  MENENIUS.
 Have I had children's voices?
  FIRST SENATOR.
 Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.

  BRUTUS.
 I say again,
    In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
    Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
    Which they have given to beggars.
 Shall remain!  
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
    His absolute 'shall'?
  COMINIUS.
 'Shall'!
    O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
    You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
    Given Hydra here to choose an officer
    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
    The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
    And make your channel his? If he have power,
    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
    Your dangerous lenity.
 You are plebeians,
    If they be senators; and they are no less,
    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
    Most palates theirs.
 Well, on to th' market-place.

  CORIOLANUS.

  BRUTUS.
 They know the corn
    Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
    They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war  
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
    They would not thread the gates.

  MENENIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.

  SICINIUS.
 Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
    As traitors do.

  CORIOLANUS.
 This a consul? No.
 Obey, I charge thee,
    And follow to thine answer.

  SICINIUS.
 Hear me, people; peace!
  PLEBEIANS.

  SICINIUS.

  MENENIUS.

  BRUTUS.
 That is the way to lay the city flat,
    To bring the roof to the foundation,
    And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
    In heaps and piles of ruin.
 Therefore lay hold of him;
    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
    Into destruction cast him.

  MENENIUS.

  AEDILES.
 Lay hands upon him
    And bear him to the rock.

                                    [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]
  CORIOLANUS.
 Down with him, down with him!
                      [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,
                                     and the people are beat in]
  MENENIUS.
 Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.

  COMINIUS.

  CORIOLANUS.

  COMINIUS.
 This man has marr'd his fortune.
 His nature is too noble for the world:
    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for's power to thunder.
                 [A noise within]
    Here's goodly work!
  PATRICIANS.

  MENENIUS.
 Where is this viper
    That would depopulate the city and
    Be every man himself?
  MENENIUS.
 Peace!
  MENENIUS.
 Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt  
    With modest warrant.

    As I do know the consul's worthiness,
    So can I name his faults.
 He consul!
  PLEBEIANS.
 Now the good gods forbid
    That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
    Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
    In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
    Should now eat up her own!
  SICINIUS.
 He's a disease that must be cut away.
 The service of the foot,
    Being once gangren'd, is not then respected  
    For what before it was.
 If it were so-
  SICINIUS.

  MENENIUS.

  FIRST PATRICIAN.

  CORIOLANUS.

  VOLUMNIA.
 O, sir, sir, sir,
    I would have had you put your power well on
    Before you had worn it out.


                    Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS

  MENENIUS.

  VOLUMNIA.

    I would dissemble with my nature where
    My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
    I should do so in honour.

  MENENIUS.

  MENENIUS.

  MENENIUS.
 He must and will.

  CORIOLANUS.

    To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour  
    Than thou of them.
 Come all to ruin.
 Let
    Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
    Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
    With as big heart as thou.
 Do as thou list.
 I'll return consul,
    Or never trust to what my tongue can do
    I' th' way of flattery further.

  VOLUMNIA.
 Arm yourself
    To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd
    With accusations, as I hear, more strong
    Than are upon you yet.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Ay, but mildly.
 Well, mildly be it then- mildly.
 I have; 'tis ready.
  
  SICINIUS.
 Very well.

  BRUTUS.
AEDILE,with the plebeians
  
  SICINIUS.

  BOTH TRIBUNES.
 Shall I be charg'd no further than this present?
    Must all determine here?
  SICINIUS.
 I am content.
 Scratches with briers,
    Scars to move laughter only.
 Consider further,
    That when he speaks not like a citizen,  
    You find him like a soldier; do not take
    His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
    But, as I say, such as become a soldier
    Rather than envy you.

  CORIOLANUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.
 Mark you this, people?
  PLEBEIANS.
 You!
  MENENIUS.
 Is this the promise that you made your mother?  
  COMINIUS.
 Then if I would
    Speak that-
  SICINIUS.

  PLEBEIANS.
 The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
                        [They all shout and throw up their caps]
  PLEBEIANS.
 Go see him out at gates, and follow him,  
    As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
    Give him deserv'd vexation.
 Let a guard
    Attend us through the city.
 Before a gate of the city

Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,
with the young NOBILITY of Rome

  CORIOLANUS.
 The beast
    With many heads butts me away.

  VIRGILIA.
 O heavens! O heavens!
  CORIOLANUS.

    I'll do well yet.

  VIRGILIA.
 Fare ye well;
    Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
    Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
    That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.

    If I could shake off but one seven years
    From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
    I'd with thee every foot.

    Come.
 A street near the gate

Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE

  SICINIUS.
 Now we have shown our power,
    Let us seem humbler after it is done
    Than when it was a-doing.

  BRUTUS.
 They say she's mad.

  VOLUMNIA.
 If that I could for weeping, you should hear-
    Nay, and you shall hear some.

  SICINIUS.
 Bastards and all.

  VOLUMNIA.
 Well, well, we'll leave you.

  SICINIUS.
 Take my prayers with you.

  MENENIUS.
 You have told them home,
    And, by my troth, you have cause.
 You'll sup with me?
  VOLUMNIA.

                                    Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA
  MENENIUS.

A highway between Rome and Antium

Enter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, meeting

  ROMAN.

  VOLSCE.
 It is so, sir.
 I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em.
 There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people
    against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
 Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they
    are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in
    the heat of their division.

  VOLSCE.

  ROMAN.
 The day serves well for them now.
 I am most fortunate thus accidentally to
    encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily
    accompany you home.
 A most royal one: the centurions and their charges,  
    distinctly billeted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on
    foot at an hour's warning.

  ROMAN.
 I have the most cause to be
    glad of yours.
 Well, let us go together.
 A goodly city is this Antium.
 City,
    'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
    Of these fair edifices fore my wars
    Have I heard groan and drop.


                           Enter A CITIZEN

    Save you, sir.
 Which is his house, beseech you?
  CITIZEN.
 Thank you, sir; farewell.
 I'll enter.

Antium.
 Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our
    fellows are asleep.

    Cotus!                                                  Exit

                       Enter CORIOLANUS

  CORIOLANUS.
 The feast smells well, but I
    Appear not like a guest.


                 Re-enter the first SERVINGMAN

  FIRST SERVANT.
  
 Exit
  CORIOLANUS.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Now th' art troublesome.
 A strange one as ever I look'd on.
 True, so I am.
 Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.

                                      [Pushes him away from him]
  THIRD SERVANT.
 And I shall.
 Under the canopy.

  THIRD SERVANT.
 I' th' city of kites and crows.

  THIRD SERVANT.

  AUFIDIUS.
 A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
    And harsh in sound to thine.
 Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet?
  AUFIDIUS.
 The painful service,
    The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
    Shed for my thankless country, are requited
    But with that surname- a good memory
    And witness of the malice and displeasure
    Which thou shouldst bear me.
 But if so be
    Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
    Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
    Longer to live most weary, and present
    My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
    Since I have ever followed thee with hate,  
    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
    It be to do thee service.
 If Jupiter
    Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
    And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
    Than thee, all noble Marcius.
 O, come, go in,
    And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
    Who now are here, taking their leaves of me
    Who am prepar'd against your territories,
    Though not for Rome itself.

  CORIOLANUS.
 absolute sir, if thou wilt have  
    The leading of thine own revenges, take
    Th' one half of my commission, and set down-
    As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
    Thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways,
    Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
    Or rudely visit them in parts remote
    To fright them ere destroy.
 But come in;
    Let me commend thee first to those that shall
    Say yea to thy desires.
 By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
    of him.

  SECOND SERVANT.
 He is simply the rarest
    man i' th' world.

  FIRST SERVANT.
 Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
  THIRD SERVANT.
 He was ever too
    hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.

  FIRST SERVANT.

    But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle
    and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half
    by the entreaty and grant of the whole table.
 He'll go, he says,
    and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all
    down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.
 But when goes this forward?
  THIRD SERVANT.

    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
    breed ballad-makers.
 Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.

  THIRD SERVANT.
 I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.

    His remedies are tame.

 Hail to you both!

  CITIZENS.
 Farewell, farewell.
 Caius Marcius was
    A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
    Self-loving-
  SICINIUS.
 The nobles in great earnestness are going
    All to the Senate House; some news is come
    That turns their countenances.
  
  SICINIUS.

    He and Aufidius can no more atone
    Than violent'st contrariety.

  SECOND MESSENGER.
 O, you have made good work!  
  MENENIUS.
 What's the news? What's the news?
  COMINIUS.

  MENENIUS.
 If!
    He is their god; he leads them like a thing
    Made by some other deity than Nature,
    That shapes man better; and they follow him
    Against us brats with no less confidence
    Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
    Or butchers killing flies.
 You have made good work,
    You and your apron men; you that stood so much  
    Upon the voice of occupation and
    The breath of garlic-eaters!
  COMINIUS.
 He'll shake
    Your Rome about your ears.
 Ay; and you'll look pale
    Before you find it other.
 You have brought
    A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
    S' incapable of help.

  BOTH TRIBUNES.

  MENENIUS.
 Tullus Aufidius,
    The second name of men, obeys his points

 For mine own part,

 Do they still fly to th' Roman?
  LIEUTENANT.
 I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
    When he shall come to his account, he knows not
    What I can urge against him.
 Although it seems,
    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
    To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly
    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
    As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
    That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
    Whene'er we come to our account.

  LIEUTENANT.

    The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
    To expel him thence.
 I think he'll be to Rome
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
    By sovereignty of nature.
 First he was  
    A noble servant to them, but he could not
    Carry his honours even.

Rome.
 No, I'll not go.
 You hear what he hath said
    Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him
    In a most dear particular.

    I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
    That we have bled together.
 Very well.

  MENENIUS.

  MENENIUS.
 Only make trial what your love can do
    For Rome, towards Marcius.
 Well, and say that Marcius
    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
    Unheard- what then?
    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
    With his unkindness? Say't be so?
  SICINIUS.
 Therefore I'll watch him
    Till he be dieted to my request,
    And then I'll set upon him.

  SICINIUS.

  FIRST WATCH.

  MENENIUS.

  FIRST WATCH.
  
  MENENIUS.
 I tell thee, fellow,
    Thy general is my lover.

    Therefore go back.
 Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always
    factionary on the party of your general.
 Can you, when
    you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in
    a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think
    to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the
    virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
    intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
    think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
    in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore
    back to Rome and prepare for your execution.

  MENENIUS.
 I mean thy general.
 My general cares not for you.
 Back- that's the utmost of  
    your having.
 Back.
 How! away!
  CORIOLANUS.
 Though I owe
    My revenge properly, my remission lies
    In Volscian breasts.
 What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
  MENENIUS.

    He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another.
 For you, be that you are, long;
    and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was
    said to: Away!                                          Exit
  FIRST WATCH.
 The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the
    oak not to be wind-shaken.
 My partner in this action,
    You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly
    I have borne this business.
 This last old man,
    Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
    Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
    Nay, godded me indeed.
 Their latest refuge
    Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
    Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd
    The first conditions, which they did refuse
    And cannot now accept.
 But out, affection!
    All bond and privilege of nature, break!
    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
 Sink, my knee, i' th' earth;       [Kneels]
    Of thy deep duty more impression show
    Than that of common sons.

  VOLUMNIA.
 O, stand up blest!
    Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
    I kneel before thee, and unproperly
    Show duty, as mistaken all this while
    Between the child and parent.
 Do you know this lady?
  CORIOLANUS.
 The noble sister of Publicola,
    The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,  
    And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
  VOLUMNIA.
 The god of soldiers,
    With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
    Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
    To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars
    Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
    And saving those that eye thee!
  VOLUMNIA.

  CORIOLANUS.
 That's my brave boy.
 Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
    Are suitors to you.
 O, no more, no more!
    You have said you will not grant us any thing-
    For we have nothing else to ask but that
    Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
    That, if you fail in our request, the blame
    May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.
 Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
    Hear nought from Rome in private.
 For how can we,
    Alas, how can we for our country pray,
    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
    Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
    The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
    Our comfort in the country.

  CORIOLANUS.
 Not of a woman's tenderness to be
    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
 No, our suit
    Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
    May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
    'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
    Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest  
    For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
    The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
    But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
    To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.
 He turns away.

    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
    Than pity to our prayers.
 So we will home to Rome,
    And die among our neighbours.

    I am hush'd until our city be afire,
    And then I'll speak a little.

                              [He holds her by the hand, silent]

    I'll frame convenient peace.

 There is no more mercy in him than there is

 Some twenty years.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
    The Queen, and Princess.
 I will remain
    The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;
    My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
    Who to my father was a friend, to me
    Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
    Though ink be made of gall.
 Be brief, I pray you.
 How, how? Another?
    You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
    And sear up my embracements from a next
    With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here  
                                              [Puts on the ring]
    While sense can keep it on.
 And, sweetest, fairest,
    As I my poor self did exchange for you,
    To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
    I still win of you.
 Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight
    If after this command thou fraught the court
    With thy unworthiness, thou diest.

    I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
    Subdues all pangs, all fears.

  CYMBELINE.
 That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
  IMOGEN.
 Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
    A seat for baseness.
 No; I rather added
    A lustre to it.
 O thou vile one!
  IMOGEN.
 Almost, sir.
 You have done
    Not after our command.
 Away with her,
    And pen her up.

    Here is your servant.
 How now, sir! What news?
  PISANIO.

  QUEEN.
 Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
    To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
    I would they were in Afric both together;
    Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
    The goer-back.

  PISANIO.

  IMOGEN.
 About some half-hour hence,
    Pray you speak with me.

  FIRST LORD.
 [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
    side the town.
 The villain would not stand me.
 Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
    added to your having, gave you some ground.
 I would they had not come between us.
  
  SECOND LORD.
 And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
  SECOND LORD.
 [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
    damn'd.

  SECOND LORD.

  CLOTEN.
 It was: his queen, his queen!
  IMOGEN.
 Then wav'd his handkerchief?
  PISANIO.

  IMOGEN.
 Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
    And that was all?
  PISANIO.
 No, madam; for so long
    As he could make me with his eye, or care
    Distinguish him from others, he did keep
    The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
    Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
    Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
    How swift his ship.

    I will attend the Queen.
 Madam, I shall.
 But I could then have look'd on him
    without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his
    endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by
    items.

  PHILARIO.
 You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
    is with that which makes him both without and within.

  IACHIMO.
 Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
    divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it
    but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay  
    flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality.

 I do nothing doubt you have store of

  PHILARIO.
 With five times so much conversation I should get ground
    of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had
    I admittance and opportunity to friend.
 No, no.
 You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,  
    and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt.
 What's that?
  POSTHUMUS.
 A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
    more- a punishment too.

  POSTHUMUS.
 This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver  
    purpose, I hope.

  PHILARIO.

  POSTHUMUS.
 Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon
    her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am
    no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain
    unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill
    opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall  
    answer me with your sword.
 I will fetch my gold and
    have our two wagers recorded.

 No further service, Doctor,

    Who shall take notice of thee.

    kindnesses I am most infinitely tied.
 Thanks, fairest lady.

  IMOGEN.

  IACHIMO.
 When he was here
    He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
    Not knowing why.
 I never saw him sad.

    There is a Frenchman his companion, one
    An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves  
    A Gallian girl at home.
 Not he, I hope.

    Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
    To pity too.
 What do you pity, sir?  
  IACHIMO.
 Am I one, sir?
    You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
    Deserves your pity?
  IACHIMO.
 I pray you, sir,
    Deliver with more openness your answers
    To my demands.
 Had I this cheek
    To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
    Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
    To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which
    Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
    Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
    Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
    That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
    Made hard with hourly falsehood- falsehood as
    With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
    Base and illustrious as the smoky light
    That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit
    That all the plagues of hell should at one time
    Encounter such revolt.

  IMOGEN.
 Let me hear no more.
 O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
    With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
    So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
    Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd
    With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
    Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures
    That play with all infirmities for gold
    Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
    As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;
    Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
    Recoil from your great stock.

  IMOGEN.

  IMOGEN.
 Let me my service tender on your lips.
 If thou wert honourable,
    Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
    For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.

    Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
    From thy report as thou from honour; and
    Solicits here a lady that disdains
    Thee and the devil alike.
- What ho, Pisanio!-
    The King my father shall be made acquainted
    Of thy assault.
 If he shall think it fit
    A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
    As in a Romish stew, and to expound
    His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
    He little cares for, and a daughter who
    He not respects at all.

  IMOGEN.

  IACHIMO.
 I had almost forgot
    T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,
    And yet of moment too, for it concerns
    Your lord; myself and other noble friends
    Are partners in the business.

  IMOGEN.
 Willingly;
    And pawn mine honour for their safety.
 I will make bold
    To send them to you only for this night;
    I must aboard to-morrow.

  IMOGEN.
 Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
    By length'ning my return.

    I have outstood my time, which is material
    'To th' tender of our present.

  IMOGEN.
 Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
    upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and
    then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
    borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my
    pleasure.
 What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
    bowl.

    That such a crafty devil as is his mother
    Should yield the world this ass! A woman that

    And leave eighteen.
 Who's there? My woman? Helen?

 Mine eyes are weak;
    Fold down the leaf where I have left.

    Of any king's in Europe! I do think
    I saw't this morning; confident I am
    Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
 I hope so.

    She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,

 I hope you know that we

 If you can make't apparent
    That you have tasted her in bed, my hand

    You had of her pure honour gains or loses

 The roof o' th' chamber
    With golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons-

    Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
    Depending on their brands.
 Then, if you can,                [Shows the bracelet]
    Be pale.
 Is it that
    Which I left with her?
  IACHIMO.
 She gave it me, and said
    She priz'd it once.
 She writes so to you, doth she?  
  POSTHUMUS.
 Back my ring.

    Render to me some corporal sign about her,
    More evident than this; for this was stol'n.

  IACHIMO.
 Her attendants are
    All sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it!
    And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.

    The cognizance of her incontinency
    Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
 Never talk on't;
    She hath been colted by him.

  IACHIMO.
 Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.

  POSTHUMUS.
 O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
    I will go there and do't, i' th' court, before
    Her father.
 Quite besides
    The government of patience! You have won.
 With all my heart.
 So doth my wife
    The nonpareil of this.
 I'll write against them,
    Detest them, curse them.

Britain.
 Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
  LUCIUS.

  CLOTEN.

  CLOTEN.

  CYMBELINE.

  CYMBELINE.
 Make pastime with us a day or
    two, or longer.

  LUCIUS.

  CYMBELINE.
 How look I
    That I should seem to lack humanity
    So much as this fact comes to? [Reads] 'Do't.
 Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
 But first of all,
    How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
    That we shall make in time from our hence-going
    And our return, to excuse.
 But first, how get hence.

    Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
    We'll talk of that hereafter.
 There's no more to say;
    Accessible is none but Milford way.
 To apprehend thus
    Draws us a profit from all things we see,
    And often to our comfort shall we find
    The sharded beetle in a safer hold
    Than is the full-wing'd eagle.
 We, poor unfledg'd,
    Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not
    What air's from home.
 Uncertain favour!
  BELARIUS.
 My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft-
    But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
    Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
    I was confederate with the Romans.
 So
    Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
    This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
    Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid
    More pious debts to heaven than in all  
    The fore-end of my time.
 He that strikes
    The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;
    To him the other two shall minister;
    And we will fear no poison, which attends
    In place of greater state.
 I'll meet you in the valleys.

    Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
    They take for natural father.
 The game is up.

Wales, near Milford Haven

Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN

  IMOGEN.

  PISANIO.
 That part thou, Pisanio, must act
    for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers.
 Some jay of Italy,
    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him.
 To pieces with me! O,
    Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
    By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
    Put on for villainy; not born where't grows,
    But worn a bait for ladies.
 Good madam, hear me.

    Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
    But now thou seem'st a coward.

  PISANIO.
 Hence, vile instrument!
    Thou shalt not damn my hand.
 Why, I must die;  
    And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
    No servant of thy master's.
 What is here?
    The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
    All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
    Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
    Be stomachers to my heart.
 And thou, Posthumus,
    That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King
    My father, and make me put into contempt the suits
    Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
    It is no act of common passage but
    A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
    To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
    That now thou tirest on, how thy memory  
    Will then be pang'd by me.
 Wherefore then
    Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd
    So many miles with a pretence? This place?
    Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
    The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
    For my being absent?- whereunto I never
    Purpose return.

  IMOGEN.
 Talk thy tongue weary- speak.

  PISANIO.
 You shall be miss'd at court,
    And that will well confirm it.
 If not at court,
    Then not in Britain must you bide.
 Prithee think
    There's livers out of Britain.
 Th' ambassador,
  LUCIUS the Roman, comes to Milford Haven
    To-morrow.

  PISANIO.
 First, make yourself but like one.

  PISANIO.
 Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
    Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
    Your carriage from the court.
 May the gods
    Direct you to the best!
  IMOGEN.
 Amen.
 CYMBELINE'S palace

Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, and LORDS

  CYMBELINE.

  LUCIUS.

    So farewell, noble Lucius.

  LUCIUS.

  CLOTEN.
 Fare you well.

  CYMBELINE.
 'Tis all the better;
    Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

  CYMBELINE.
 Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
    How it goes here.


                 Re-enter MESSENGER

  CYMBELINE.
 Please you, sir,
    Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer  
    That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.
 Her doors lock'd?
    Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
    Prove false!                                            Exit
  QUEEN.

  QUEEN.
 She being down,
    I have the placing of the British crown.


                   Re-enter CLOTEN

    How now, my son?
  CLOTEN.
 I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,
    And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
    Than lady, ladies, woman.
 I love her therefore; but
    Disdaining me and throwing favours on  
    The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
    That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point
    I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
    To be reveng'd upon her.
 Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
    Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
    Thou art straightway with the fiends.

  PISANIO.
 Close villain,
    I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
    Thy heart to find it.

  PISANIO.
 O my all-worthy lord!
  CLOTEN.

  CLOTEN.

  PISANIO.
                                Exit
  CLOTEN.
 Thou bid'st me to my loss; for true to thee
    Were to prove false, which I will never be,
    To him that is most true.

Wales.
 I see a man's life is a tedious one.
 O Jove! I think
    Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
    Where they should be reliev'd.
 Now I think on thee
    My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
    At point to sink for food.

    I were best not call; I dare not call.
 Yet famine,
    Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
 Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.

    Such a foe, good heavens!                 Exit into the cave

            Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

  BELARIUS.
 Now, peace be here,
    Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
  GUIDERIUS.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in.
.
 Good masters, harm me not.

    I would have left it on the board, so soon
    As I had made my meal, and parted
    With pray'rs for the provider.
 Whither bound?
  IMOGEN.
 What's your name?
  IMOGEN.
 Prithee, fair youth,
    Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds  
    By this rude place we live in.
 Most welcome!
    Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Would I could free't!
  ARVIRAGUS.
 [Whispering] Hark, boys.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 I pray draw near.
 He creates
    Lucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes,
    For this immediate levy, he commands
    His absolute commission.
 We will discharge our duty.
 Near the cave of BELARIUS

Enter CLOTEN alone

  CLOTEN.
 How fit his garments serve me! Why should
    his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be
    fit too? The rather- saving reverence of the word- for 'tis said
    a woman's fitness comes by fits.

Wales.
 Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
 The breach of custom
    Is breach of all.
  
    I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
    Stealing so poorly.
 I love thee; I have spoke it.

  BELARIUS.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 To th' field, to th' field!
    We'll leave you for this time.
 Pray be not sick,
    For you must be our huswife.
 Well, or ill,
    I am bound to you.

  BELARIUS.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 How angel-like he sings!
  GUIDERIUS.
 Nobly he yokes
    A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
    Was that it was for not being such a smile;
    The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
    From so divine a temple to commix
    With winds that sailors rail at.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 Grow patience!
    And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine  
    His perishing root with the increasing vine!
  BELARIUS.
 I fear some ambush.
 A thing
    More slavish did I ne'er than answering  
    'A slave' without a knock.

  GUIDERIUS.
 To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
    An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
    Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
    My dagger in my mouth.
 No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
    Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,
    Which, as it seems, make thee.

  CLOTEN.
 Thou precious varlet,
    My tailor made them not.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Were it toad, or adder, spider,
    'Twould move me sooner.
 None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.

  GUIDERIUS.

  BELARIUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Although perhaps
    It may be heard at court that such as we
    Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
    May make some stronger head- the which he hearing,
    As it is like him, might break out and swear
    He'd fetch us in; yet is't not probable
    To come alone, either he so undertaking
    Or they so suffering.

  ARVIRAGUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 I would revenges,
    That possible strength might meet, would seek us through,
    And put us to our answer.

    We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
    Where there's no profit.
 Poor sick Fidele!
    I'll willingly to him; to gain his colour
    I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blood,
    And praise myself for charity.
 My ingenious instrument!
    Hark, Polydore, it sounds.
 Is he at home?
  BELARIUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 Look, here he comes,
    And brings the dire occasion in his arms
    Of what we blame him for!
  ARVIRAGUS.
 The bird is dead
    That we have made so much on.
 I had rather
    Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
    To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch,
    Than have seen this.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 Prithee have done,
    And do not play in wench-like words with that
    Which is so serious.
 To th' grave.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten
    Is quite forgot.
 'Tis true.

  GUIDERIUS.


                      SONG

  GUIDERIUS.
 Fear no more the lightning flash,
  ARVIRAGUS.
      All lovers young, all lovers must
             Consign to thee and come to dust.
 No exorciser harm thee!
  ARVIRAGUS.
 Upon their faces.

    Come on, away.

    The ground that gave them first has them again.
 [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven.
 But 'tis not so;
    'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
    Which the brain makes of fumes.
 Good faith,
    I tremble still with fear; but if there be  
    Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
    As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
    The dream's here still.
 Pisanio,
    All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
    And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
    Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
    Hath here cut off my lord.

  LUCIUS.
 When expect you them?
  CAPTAIN.
 Last night the very gods show'd me a vision-
    I fast and pray'd for their intelligence- thus:
    I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
    From the spongy south to this part of the west,
    There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends,
    Unless my sins abuse my divination,
    Success to th' Roman host.
 Dream often so,
    And never false.
 Young one,
    Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems
    They crave to be demanded.
 I may wander
    From east to occident; cry out for service;
    Try many, all good; serve truly; never
    Find such another master.
 Thy name?
  IMOGEN.
 Go with me.

  IMOGEN.
 Come, arm him.

Britain.
 Again! and bring me word how 'tis with her.

    I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
    All parts of his subjection loyally.
 For Cloten,
    There wants no diligence in seeking him,
    And will no doubt be found.
 So please your Majesty,
    The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
    Are landed on your coast, with a supply
    Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.
 I thank you.
 Let's withdraw,
    And meet the time as it seeks us.

    All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
    Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
      Exit




SCENE IV.
 What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
    From action and adventure?
  GUIDERIUS.

  ARVIRAGUS.
 Many years,
    Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
    From my remembrance.
 Pray, sir, to th' army.

  ARVIRAGUS.

  GUIDERIUS.
 So say I.
 [Aside] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn
    Till it fly out and show them princes born.

ACT V.
 The Roman camp

Enter POSTHUMUS alone, with a bloody handkerchief

  POSTHUMUS.
 But alack,
    You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
    To have them fall no more.

    But Imogen is your own.

    Gods, put the strength o' th' Leonati in me!
    To shame the guise o' th' world, I will begin
    The fashion- less without and more within.
 A field of battle between the British and Roman camps

Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman army at one door, and the British army
at another, LEONATUS POSTHUMUS following like a poor soldier.
  Alarums.
 The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
    Takes off my manhood.

    If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
    This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
    Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.
 Then re-enter LUCIUS and IACHIMO,
                         with IMOGEN

  LUCIUS.
 'Tis their fresh supplies.
 Or betimes
    Let's reinforce or fly.

  POSTHUMUS.
                             Exit
  POSTHUMUS.
 Great the slaughter is
    Here made by th' Roman; great the answer be
    Britons must take.
 So 'tis reported;  
    But none of 'em can be found.

Britain.
 A prison

Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS

  FIRST GAOLER.
                Exeunt GAOLERS
  POSTHUMUS.
 My conscience, thou art fetter'd
    More than my shanks and wrists; you good gods, give me
    The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
    Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
    So children temporal fathers do appease;
    Gods are more full of mercy.
 To satisfy,
    If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take  
    No stricter render of me than my all.
 And so, great pow'rs,
    If you will take this audit, take this life,
    And cancel these cold bonds.
 Great Nature like his ancestry
              Moulded the stuff so fair
            That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world
              As great Sicilius' heir.
   Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
              Take off his miseries.


  BROTHERS.
 No more, you petty spirits of region low,
    Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
    Accuse the Thunderer whose bolt, you know,
    Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts?
    Poor shadows of Elysium, hence and rest
    Upon your never-withering banks of flow'rs.
 Be content;
    Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift;
    His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
 Rise and fade!
    He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,
    And happier much by his affliction made.

  ALL.

  GAOLER.
 And how you
    shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to
    tell one.
 I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct
    them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.
 Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.

  GAOLER.
                         Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
  GAOLER.
 Yet, on my conscience, there are verier
    knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some
    of them too that die against their wills; so should I, if I were
    one.

  BELARIUS.


             Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES

    There's business in these faces.

  CORNELIUS.
 Hail, great King!
    To sour your happiness I must report  
    The Queen is dead.
 How ended she?
  CORNELIUS.
 More, sir, and worse.

  CYMBELINE.
 Consider, sir, the chance of war.
 Never master had
    A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
    So tender over his occasions, true,
    So feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join
    With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness
    Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm
    Though he have serv'd a Roman.

  CYMBELINE.
' Ne'er thank thy master.
 I humbly thank your Highness.
 I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
    And yet I know thou wilt.
 The boy disdains me,
    He leaves me, scorns me.
 Briefly die their joys
    That place them on the truth of girls and boys.

    Why stands he so perplex'd?
  CYMBELINE.
 Is not this boy reviv'd from death?
  ARVIRAGUS.
 The same dead thing alive.

    Since she is living, let the time run on
    To good or bad.
 On, speak to him.

  CYMBELINE.

  CYMBELINE.
 I stand on fire.
 This Posthumus,
    Most like a noble lord in love and one
    That had a royal lover, took his hint;
    And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein
    He was as calm as virtue- he began
    His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,
    And then a mind put in't, either our brags
    Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description
    Prov'd us unspeaking sots.
 Nay, nay, to th' purpose.

    He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
    And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
    Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him
    Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
    Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
    In suit the place of's bed, and win this ring
    By hers and mine adultery.
 He, true knight,
    No lesser of her honour confident
    Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
    And would so, had it been a carbuncle
    Of Phoebus' wheel; and might so safely, had it
    Been all the worth of's car.
 Being thus quench'd
    Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
    Gan in your duller Britain operate  
    Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
    And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd
    That I return'd with simular proof enough
    To make the noble Leonatus mad,
    By wounding his belief in her renown
    With tokens thus and thus; averring notes
    Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet-
    O cunning, how I got it!- nay, some marks
    Of secret on her person, that he could not
    But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
    I having ta'en the forfeit.
 Whereupon-
    Methinks I see him now-
  POSTHUMUS.
 [Coming forward] Ay, so thou dost,
    Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
    Egregious murderer, thief, anything
    That's due to all the villains past, in being,
    To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
    Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out
    For torturers ingenious.
 Every villain
    Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus, and
    Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen!
    My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
    Imogen, Imogen!
  IMOGEN.
 How comes these staggers on me?  
  PISANIO.
 How fares my mistress?
  IMOGEN.
 O, get thee from my sight;
    Thou gav'st me poison.
 O gods!
    I left out one thing which the Queen confess'd,
    Which must approve thee honest.
 Have you ta'en of it?
  IMOGEN.

  IMOGEN.
                              [Embracing him]
  POSTHUMUS.
 [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this
      youth, I blame ye not;
    You had a motive for't.

  CYMBELINE.

  CYMBELINE.

  PISANIO.
 Prithee, valiant youth,
    Deny't again.

  GUIDERIUS.
 I have spoke it, and I did it.
 Stay, sir King.

    This man is better than the man he slew,
    As well descended as thyself, and hath
    More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
    Had ever scar for.
 We will die all three;
    But I will prove that two on's are as good
    As I have given out him.

  GUIDERIUS.

  BELARIUS.

  CYMBELINE.
 He it is that hath
    Assum'd this age; indeed a banish'd man;
    I know not how a traitor.

  BELARIUS.
 Mighty sir,
    These two young gentlemen that call me father,
    And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
    They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
    And blood of your begetting.
 My breeding was, sir, as
    Your Highness knows.
 Beaten for loyalty
    Excited me to treason.
 But, gracious sir,
    Here are your sons again, and I must lose
    Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.

  CYMBELINE.
 O, what am I?
    A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
    Rejoic'd deliverance more.
 Ay, my good lord.
 And at first meeting lov'd,
    Continu'd so until we thought he died.
 See,
    Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
    And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
    On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
    Each object with a joy; the counterchange
    Is severally in all.

    [To BELARIUS] Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
 You are my father too, and did relieve me
    To see this gracious season.
 All o'erjoy'd
    Save these in bonds.

  POSTHUMUS.
 I am, sir,  
    The soldier that did company these three
    In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
    The purpose I then follow'd.
 Take that life, beseech you,
    Which I so often owe; but your ring first,
    And here the bracelet of the truest princess
    That ever swore her faith.

  LUCIUS.
 Read, and declare the meaning.
 Well,
    My peace we will begin.
 So through Lud's Town march;
    And in the temple of great Jupiter
    Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.

  Marcellus, Officer.

  Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.

  Rosencrantz, courtier.

  A Priest.

 You come most carefully upon your hour.
 For this relief much thanks.
 Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran.
 Friends to this ground.

  Mar.

  Fran.
 Give you good night.

    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran.
 A piece of him.
 Welcome, good Marcellus.

  Hor.
 See, it stalks away!
  Hor.
  
  Mar.
 Is it not like the King?
  Hor.
 As thou art to thyself.

  Mar.
 In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor.
 That can I.

    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.

    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor.
 'Tis here!
  Mar.
 'Tis gone!

  Hor.

  Hor.

    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
 So much for him.

    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
 In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
 We doubt it nothing.

                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.

    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit.

    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham.

    Thou know'st 'tis common.
 All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.

  King.

    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.

  Ham.
 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
 Come away.
 O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely.
 Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married.
 I am glad to see you well.
 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
 Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
 My good lord!
  Ham.
 I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.

  Hor.
 I saw him once.

    These hands are not more like.

  Ham.

  Ham.
 But this troubles me.

    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar.

  Ham.
 What, look'd he frowningly.

  Ham.
 Nay, very pale.
 Longer, longer.

  Hor.
 I warr'nt it will.

  Ham.
 Our duty to your honour.
  
  Ham.

Exit.





Scene III.


Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
 For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
 Think it no more.

    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head.
 Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.

    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  
  Pol.

  Oph.
 I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol.
 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

  Oph.





Scene IV.
 The platform before the Castle.


  Ham.
 The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

  Hor.
 Indeed? I heard it not.
 Is it a custom?
  Ham.
 Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee.

  Hor.
 It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
 Do not, my lord!
  Ham.

  Hor.

    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
 My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
 Unhand me, gentlemen.

    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on.
 I'll follow thee.

  Hor.

  Hor.
 Have after.

  Mar.
 Nay, let's follow him.


  Ham.

  Ghost.

  Ghost.
 Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost.

  Ghost.

  Ham.
 But that I am forbid  
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand an end
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.

  Ham.
 Murther?
  Ghost.
 I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this.
 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.

    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
                      Exit.
 O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up.
 (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
 Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham.

  Hor.
 Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar.
 Nor I, my lord.
 Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.

  Ham.

  Hor.

  Ham.
 Never make known what you have seen to-night.

  Hor.
 Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.

    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.

  Ghost.
 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham.

    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),  
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
]
  Ham.
  
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II.
 I will, my lord.

  Rey.

  Rey.
 But, my good lord-
  Pol.
'
  Pol.
 At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.

    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son.
 My lord, I have.
 God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey.
  
  Rey.

  Rey.
 With what, i' th' name of God I
  Oph.

  Pol.
 Long stay'd he so.
 That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.

    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him.


Scene II.
 What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of.
 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres.

  King.
 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
 Thou still hast been the father of good news.

  Pol.

  Pol.
 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.


              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt.

    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.

    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.

  Queen.
 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
 A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.

    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this.
 I will be faithful.
]  

          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.

      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
    it.
 But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol.
 But what might you think,  
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
 How may we try it further?
  Pol.
 You know sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.

  Queen.
 So he does indeed.

  Pol.

    Mark the encounter.
 But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
 O, give me leave.

  Pol.
 Excellent well.
 To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.

  Ham.
 Conception is a blessing, but not
    as your daughter may conceive.
 He said I was a fishmonger.
 He is far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
    for love- very near this.

  Pol.
 Between who?
  Pol.
 I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
    him and my daughter.
- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
    my leave of you.

  Ham.

  Guil.

    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.

  Ham.

  Ros.

  Ham.

  Ros.
 We think not so, my lord.

  Guil.
 Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
 Why, anything- but to th' purpose.
 I know the good King and Queen
    have sent for you.
 [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham.
- If you love me, hold
    not off.

  Ham.
 I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.

  Ham.

  Ros.
 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros.
 No indeed are they not.
  
  Ham.
 How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros.

  Ham.
 Is't possible?
  Guil.
 O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
 Do the boys carry it away?  
  Ros.
 There are the players.
 Your hands, come! Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.
 I am but mad north-north-west.

  
                            Enter Polonius.
 My lord, I have news to tell you.
 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
    the only men.

  Ham.
 Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine.
 Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.
 What speech, my good lord?
  Ham.
 Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.


  1.
 His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command.
 For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
 Play.

  Pol.
 Play.

  Ham.

 And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros.
 Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
 Did he receive you well?
  Ros.

  Guil.
 They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
 I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness.
- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.
- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.

    O heavy burthen!
  Pol.


  Ham.
 To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to.
 'Tis a consummation  
    Devoutly to be wish'd.

    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause.

  Oph.
 Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham.

    I pray you, now receive them.
 My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich.
 Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

  Ham.
 I loved you
    not.

  Ham.
 Farewell.
 If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
    calumny.
 Get thee to a nunnery.
 Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them.

  Oph.
 O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham.
 I have heard of your paintings too, well enough.
 There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.

    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself.

Elsinore.


Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.


  Ham.
 I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
    Termagant.
 Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.

  Ham.
 That's villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
 Go  
    make you ready.


            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both.
 We will, my lord.
 Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning.
 Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.
 If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy.
 I must be idle.

  King.
 No, nor mine now.

  Ham.
 Ay, my lord.

  Queen.
 Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.

  Oph.
 The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action.

  Ham.
 We shall know by this fellow.
                     [Exit.
 As woman's love.

      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.

      But, orderly to end where I begun,  
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
 'Tis deeply sworn.

  Ham.

  King.
 What do you call the play?
  Ham.


                         Enter Lucianus.
 Still better, and worse.
 His name's Gonzago.
  
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian.
 You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
 Give o'er the play.
 Give me some light! Away!
  All.
 Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.

  Hor.

    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
 Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
 Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil.
  
  Ham.

  Ham.
 I am tame, sir; pronounce.

  Ham.

  Ros.

  Ham.
 We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
 To withdraw with you- why do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
    into a toil?
  Guil.
 I do not well understand that.
 But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony.
 Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak.
 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
    you cannot play upon me.

  Ham.
- I will come by-and-by.

  Pol.
 I will say so.
                                      Exit.

                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.
]  
    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world.
 Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.

    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
 I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range.

    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
 The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
    What's near it with it.
 It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin.

                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.
 But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.

    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
 What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.

    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.

    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes.
              Exit.
 [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.


  Pol.
 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
 Why, how now, Hamlet?  
  Ham.
 You shall not budge I
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.

  Queen.
 What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol.
 Is it the King?
  Queen.
 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham.
 Take thy fortune.
 What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
 Proclaim no shame  
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
 O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.

  Ham.
 Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen.
 O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
 Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost.

    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
 Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen.
 This is the very coinage of your brain.

  Ham.
 Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music.

    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
 What shall I do?
  Ham.

  Queen.
 Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
 Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
 There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery.
 Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon.

    Good night, mother.

Elsinore.
 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure.
 [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.


  Ham.
 Safely stow'd.

  Gentlemen.


               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ham.

  Ros.

  Ham.
 I am glad of it.
 Of nothing.

    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence.
 To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause.
 But where is he?
  Ros.
 Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham.

  King.
 Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
 Your fat king and your lean beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table.
 That's the
    end.

  King.
 In heaven.
 Send thither to see.
]
  King.
 Therefore prepare thyself.
 Good.
 So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
 I see a cherub that sees them.
 But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.

  Ham.
 My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
    one flesh; and so, my mother.

  King.
 Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet.
 Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
 I will do't, my lord.

  For.

                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].
 Who commands them, sir?
  Capt.
 Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt.

    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
 Yes, it is already garrison'd.

    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd.

Elsinore.

  Gent.
 She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense.
 Let her come in.


                 Enter Ophelia distracted.
 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph.


  Queen.
  
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.

  Oph.


            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.
 O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
    Give, me superfluous death.
 Alack, what noise is this?
  King.
 No, let's come in!
  Laer.
 Do not fear our person.
 Let him go, Gertrude.
 How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation.
 None but his enemies.

  King.
 Will you know them then?
  Laer.

  King.

    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
'
  Laer.
 How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.


  Oph.
 We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.

    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.

    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.

 (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King.
 Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of  
    very warlike appointment gave us chase.

  King.
 O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong.

  Laer.
 You shortly shall hear more.

    Leave us.
 But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.
'
  King.

  King.
 It falls right.

  Laer.
 He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast.

  Laer.

  Laer.

    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal.
 If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.

    'Twere better not assay'd.
 Soft! let me see.
 Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
 Drown'd, drown'd.

    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.
 Let's follow, Gertrude.

ACT V.

Elsinore.
 A churchyard.
 Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other.
 How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other.
 Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown.
 Here lies the water; good.
 But is this law?
  Clown.
 Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.

  Other.
 If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other.
 Go to!
  Clown.
 To't again, come!
  Other.
 Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
 (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
 (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
           For such a guest is meet.


  Ham.
 Not a jot more, my lord.

  Ham.
 Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor.
 I  
    will speak to this fellow.


  Ham.

  Clown.

    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
 Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown.
 How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us.
 By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
    his kibe.
 How long is that since?
  Clown.
 Why, because 'a was mad.
 There the men are as mad as
    he.
 I have been sexton here, man and boy  
    thirty years.
 How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown.
 A tanner will last
    you nine year.
 Nay, I know not.

  Ham.
 Here hung those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft.

  Hor.
 Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
  Hor.
 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

  Laer.
 Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
 [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.

    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear.
 Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
 I lov'd Ophelia.
 Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum.
 O, he is mad, Laertes.
 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
 This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.

    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
 I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

    We'll put the matter to the present push.

    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.





Scene II.
 A hall in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
 Remember it, my lord!
  Ham.
 Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes.
 Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor.
 Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold  
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.

  Hor.

  Ham.

  Hor.
 How was this seal'd?
  Ham.
 Why, what a king is this!
  Ham.
 I humbly thank you, sir.
 [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor.
 'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
  
  Osr.
 But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
 Sir, this is the matter-
  Ham.

                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.
]
  Osr.
 Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.

  Ham.

    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
 All's golden words are
    spent.
 Well, sir?  
  Osr.

  Ham.
 That's two of his weapons- but well.

  Osr.
 The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

  Ham.
 Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham.
] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.

  Hor.
 My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall.
]
  Hor.

  Hor.
 Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
    the fall of a sparrow.
 Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
 Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
 I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.

    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction.
 What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
 If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.

  Ham.

    Give us the foils.

  Laer.
 Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham.

  King.
 I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

  Laer.

  Ham.
 No.
 Judgment!
  Osr.
 Well, again!
  King.
 Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
 What say you?
  Laer.
  
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
 Good madam!
  King.

  Ham.
 Come, let me wipe thy face.
 I do not think't.

  Laer.
 [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
                               Play.

  Osr.

  Ham.
 Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor.

    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

  Queen.
]
  Ham.
 O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.

    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd.
 Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again.

    I can no more.
 Treason! treason!
  King.

  Ham.

  Laer.

    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
 Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.

    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.
 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.

    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.
 Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

    So bloodily hast struck.

 So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
    And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
    To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.

    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
    Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood.
 Those opposed eyes
    Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
    All of one nature, of one substance bred,
    Did lately meet in the intestine shock
    And furious close of civil butchery,
    Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks
    March all one way and be no more oppos'd
    Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.
 Then let me hear
    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
    What yesternight our Council did decree
    In forwarding this dear expedience.
 This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;
    For more uneven and unwelcome news
    Came from the North, and thus it did import:
    On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,
    Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
    That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
    At Holmedon met,
    Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;  
    As by discharge of their artillery
    And shape of likelihood the news was told;
    For he that brought them, in the very heat
    And pride of their contention did take horse,
    Uncertain of the issue any way.

  King.

    But let him from my thoughts.

  West.
                                 Exeunt.


Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff.
 What, none?
  Fal.
 No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to  
    an egg and butter.
 As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not
    a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?  
  Fal.
 How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy
    quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?
  Prince.

  Fal.

  Prince.
 No; thou shalt.
 Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
 Zounds, where thou wilt, lad! I'll make one.

  Fal.


                             Enter Poins.


    Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match.
 Good morrow, Ned.
 Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his
    bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs.
 Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil.
 But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock
    early, at Gadshill! There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with
    rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses.

  Prince.

  Fal.

London.
 The Palace.
 My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
    Unapt to stir at these indignities,
    And you have found me, for accordingly
    You tread upon my patience; but be sure
    I will from henceforth rather be myself,
    Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,
    Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
    And therefore lost that title of respect
    Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
 My lord-
  King.
  
    O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
    And majesty might never yet endure
    The moody frontier of a servant brow.

    Tou have good leave to leave us.

    But I remember, when the fight was done,
    When I was dry with rage and extreme toll,
    Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
    Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dress'd,
    Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd  
    Show'd like a stubble land at harvest home.

    With many holiday and lady terms
    He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
    My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.

  King.

  Hot.
 Revolted Mortimer?
    He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,  
    But by the chance of war.

    Here comes your uncle.


                          Enter Worcester.
 Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
  Hot.
 Was not he proclaim'd
    By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?
  North.
 But soft, I pray you.
 I cry you mercy.
 Those same noble Scots
    That are your prisoners-
  Hot.
 Hear you, cousin, a word.
 All studies here I solemnly defy
    Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke;
    And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-
    But that I think his father loves him not
    And would be glad he met with some mischance,
    I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.

  Wor.

    In Richard's time- what do you call the place-
    A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
    'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
    His uncle York- where I first bow'd my knee
    Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke-
    'S blood!
    When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh-
  North.
 [To Northumberland] You, my lord,
    Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
    Shall secretly into the bosom creep
    Of that same noble prelate well-belov'd,
    The Archbishop.

  Hot.
 Of York, is it not?
  Wor.
 Upon my life, it will do well.
 Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
 And so they shall.
  
  Hot.
 No further go in this
    Than I by letters shall direct your course.

    When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
    I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,
    Where you and Douglas, and our pow'rs at once,
    As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
    To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
    Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

  North.
 An inn yard.


  2.

  2.
 I think it be two o'clock.

  Gads.

  1.
 I pray thee lend me thine.
 Car.
 That's even as fair as- 'at hand, quoth the chamberlain'; for
    thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction
    doth from labouring: thou layest the plot how.
 I heard him tell it
    to one of his company last night at supper- a kind of auditor;  
    one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.

  Cham.
 I pray thee keep that for the hangman;
    for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of
    falsehood may.
 What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'll make
    a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me,
    and thou knowest he is no starveling.
 What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water
    in foul way?
  Gads.
 We steal as in
    a castle, cocksure.

  Cham.
 Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night
    than to fernseed for your walking invisible.

  Gads.
 Give me thy hand.

  Gads.
 Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men.
 Bid the ostler
    bring my gelding out of the stable.


  Poins.


  Fal.
 Poins! Poins, and be hang'd! Poins!
  Prince.
 I'll go seek him.

                                                  [Steps aside.
 If I travel but
    four foot by the squire further afoot, I shall break my wind.
 I have forsworn his company  
    hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitch'd
    with the rogue's company.
 If the rascal have not given me
    medicines to make me love him, I'll be hang'd.
 It could not be
    else.
 Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles
    afoot with me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well
    enough.
 [comes forward] Peace, ye fat-guts! Lie down, lay thine ear
    close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of
    travellers.
 Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblood,
    I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin
    in thy father's exchequer.
 What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
  Prince.
 Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be
    ta'en, I'll peach for this.


             Enter Gadshill, [Bardolph and Peto with him].

  Poins.
 [comes fortward] O, 'tis our setter.
 I know his voice.

  Gads.
 There's enough to make us all.

  Fal.
 To be hang'd.

  Prince.

  Peto.
 Zounds, will they not rob us?
  Prince.
 Stand close.


  Traveller.
 You are grandjurors, are ye? We'll jure ye,
    faith!
                            Here they rob and bind them.


            Enter the Prince and Poins [in buckram suits].

  Poins.


  Fal.
 Villains!

  Prince.
 Now merrily to horse.
 Falstaff sweats to death
    And lards the lean earth as he walks along.





Scene III.
 'But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to
    be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.
' Say you so, say you so?
    I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you
    lie.
 Is there not my father, my uncle, and
    myself; Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen
    Glendower? Is there not, besides, the Douglas? Have I not all
    their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month,
    and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan
    rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very
    sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the King and lay open
    all our proceedings.
 O, I could divide myself and go to buffets
    for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action!
    Hang him, let him tell the King! we are prepared.

  Lady.

    Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,
    And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
    That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
    Like bubbles ill a late-disturbed stream,
    And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,  
    Such as we see when men restrain their breath
    On some great sudden hest.
 O, what portents are these?
    Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
    And I must know it, else he loves me not.
 What, ho!

                    [Enter a Servant.

  Hot.
 What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
  Serv.
 It is, my lord.
 O esperance!
    Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.

                                                 [Exit Servant.
 What is it carries you away?
  Hot.
 Why, my horse, my love- my horse!
  Lady.
 Out, you mad-headed ape!
    A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
    As you are toss'd with.

  Lady.

    Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not;
    I care not for thee, Kate.

  Hot.
 How? so far?
  Hot.
 Not an inch further.
                                Exeunt.


Enter Prince and Poins.

  Poins.
 Francis!                                  [Exit Poins.

  Fran.
 Forsooth, five years, and as much as to-
  Poins.
 [within] Francis!
  Fran.
 O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in England I
    could find in my heart-
  Poins.
 [within] Francis!
  Fran.
 Anon, sir.

  Prince.
 How old art thou, Francis?
  Fran.
 Ask me when thou
    wilt, and, thou shalt have it.
 [within] Francis!
  Fran.
 Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,
    Francis, a Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt.
 In Barbary,
    sir, it cannot come to so much.
 What, sir?
  Poins.
 The Drawer stands amazed,
                                    not knowing which way to go.


                         Enter Vintner.
 Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
 Shall we be merry?
  Poins.
 I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours
    since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this
    present this twelve o'clock at midnight.
                                 [Exit.
 Call in ribs, call
    in tallow.
 Welcome, Jack.
 Where hast thou been?
  Fal.
 Ere I lead this life long, I'll
    sew nether-stocks, and mend them and foot them too.
 A
    plague of all cowards I say still!
  Prince.
 A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a
    dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock
    of wild geese, I'll never wear hair on my face more.
 Are not you a coward? Answer me to that- and Poins there?
  Poins.

  Fal.
 O villain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st
    last.
 All is one for that.
) A plague of all cowards
    still say I.
 Where is it, Taken from us it is.
 What, a hundred, man?
  Fal.
 How was it?
  Gads.

  Fal.
 What, fought you with them all?
  Fal.
 All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with
    fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish! If there were not two or
    three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legg'd
    creature.
 Nay, that's past praying for.
 I tell thee
    what, Hal- if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.

    Thou knowest my old ward.

    Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.
 I made me
    no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.

  Prince.
 Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
 Dost thou hear me, Hal?
  Prince.
 So, two more already.

  Fal.
 These lies are like their father that begets them- gross as
    a mountain, open, palpable.
 Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
 What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strappado or
    all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion.

  Prince.
 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
    neat's-tongue, you bull's sizzle, you stockfish- O for breath to
    utter what is like thee!- you tailor's yard, you sheath, you
    bowcase, you vile standing tuck!
  Prince.
 I was now a coward on
    instinct.
 O Jesu, my lord the Prince!
  Prince.
 Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him
    back again to my mother.

  Fal.
 Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
 O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago
    and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush'd
    extempore.
 I do.
  
  Bard.
 Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

  Prince.
 That same mad fellow of the North, Percy, and he of
    Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold,
    and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
    hook- what a plague call you him?
  Poins.
 You have hit it.
 Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

  Fal.

  Prince.
 Well, here is my leg.

  Host.
 Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.
 O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!
  Fal.
 O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as
    ever I see!
  Fal.
 That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's
    word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of
    thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth
    warrant me.
 Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A
    question to be ask'd.
 What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
  Fal.
 My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
 The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
 Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me.
 I would your Grace would take me with you.

  Prince.

  Fal.
 That he is old (the more the pity) his white
    hairs do witness it; but that he is (saving your reverence) a
    whoremaster, that I utterly deny.
 O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most monstrous watch
    is at the door.
 Out, ye rogue! Play out the play.

  Fal.
 I deny your major.
 If you will deny the sheriff, so; if not,
    let him enter.
 Call in the sheriff.

                            [Exeunt Manent the Prince and Peto.
 If he have robb'd these men,
    He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
 Good night, my noble lord.

                                            Exit [with Carrier].
 Go call him
    forth.

 .
 I'll to
    the court in the morning .
 Be with me betimes
    in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto.
 These promises are fair, the parties sure,
    And our induction full of prosperous hope.

  Hot.
 Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
    Will you sit down?
    And uncle Worcester.

  Glend.
 I cannot blame him.
 At my nativity
    The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
    Of burning cressets, and at my birth
    The frame and huge foundation of the earth  
    Shak'd like a coward.

  Hot.
 I say the earth did shake when I was born.

  Glend.

    These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,
    And all the courses of my life do show
    I am not in the roll of common men.
 Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.
 And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil-
    By telling truth.

    If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
    And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.

  Glend.
 Home without boots, and in foul weather too?
    How scapes he agues, in the devil's name
  Glend.
 Shall we divide our right
    According to our threefold order ta'en?
  Mort.

    And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
    Which being sealed interchangeably
    (A business that this night may execute),
    To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
    And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
    To meet your father and the Scottish bower,
    As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.

    [To Glend.

  Glend.

  Glend.
 Not wind? It shall, it must! You see it doth.

  Mort.

  Glend.
 I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
    For I was train'd up in the English court,
    Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
    Many an English ditty lovely well,
    And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-
    A virtue that was never seen in you.
 Marry,
    And I am glad of it with all my heart!
    I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
    Than one of these same metre ballet-mongers.
 I had rather live
    With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
    Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
    In any summer house in Christendom).
 In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
    Exceedingly well read, and profited
    In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,
    And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
    As mines of India.
 Faith, he does.

    But I will never be a truant, love,
    Till I have learnt thy language: for thy tongue
    Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
    Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r,  
    With ravishing division, to her lute.

  Lady P.
 Go, ye giddy goose.

                                                The music plays.

  Lady P.

  Lady P.
 No.

  Lady P.
 To the Welsh lady's bed.
 Peace! she sings.

                               Here the Lady sings a Welsh song.

    Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
    A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
    And such protest of pepper gingerbread
    To velvet guards and Sunday citizens.
 I will not sing.
 'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast-teacher.
 You are as slow
    As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.

  Mort.

                                                         Exeunt.


  King.
 Lords, give us leave.

    Yet such extenuation let me beg
    As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,
    Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
    By, smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
    I may, for some things true wherein my youth
    Hath faulty wand'red and irregular,
    And pardon on lily true submission.

  King.
 God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,
    At thy affections, which do hold a wing,
    Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.

    By being seldom seen, I could not stir
    But, like a comet, I Was wond'red at;
    That men would tell their children, 'This is he!'
    Others would say, 'Where? Which is Bolingbroke?'
    And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
    And dress'd myself in such humility
    That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
    Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
    Even in the presence of the crowned King.

    The skipping King, he ambled up and down
    With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
    Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state;
    Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools;
    Had his great name profaned with their scorns
    And gave his countenance, against his name,
    To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
    Of every beardless vain comparative;
    Grew a companion to the common streets,
    Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
    That, being dally swallowed by men's eyes,
    They surfeited with honey and began
    To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
    More than a little is by much too much.

    Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
    This infant warrior, in his enterprises
    Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,
    Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,  
    To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
    And shake the peace and safety of our throne.


    How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed.





Scene III.

  Bard.
 Thou art our
    admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop- but 'tis in the
    nose of thee.

  Fal.
 God reward me for
    it!
  Bard.
 Ye lie, hostess.
 He had his part of it; let him pay.

  Fal.
 How? the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup.


      Enter the Prince [and Poins], marching; and Falstaff meets
          them, playing upon his truncheon like a fife.
 Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

  Fal.
 The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had my
    pocket pick'd.

  Prince.
  
  Prince.
 There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.

  Fal.

  Host.

  Fal.
 Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
    otherwise.

  Host.
 Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
  Fal.
 What beast? Why, an otter.

  Prince.
 Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to
    have her.
 So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought
    him a thousand pound.

  Prince.

  Prince.
 It is all fill'd up with guts and midriff.
 Hostess, I forgive thee.
 [Exit Hostess.
] Now, Hal, to the
    news at court.

    The money is paid back again.

  Prince.

  Prince.
 My lord?

  Hot.

    Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
 Thou art the king of honour.

  Hot.
 Letters from him? Why comes he not himself?
  Mess.

  Hot.
 He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
    And at the time of my departure thence
    He was much fear'd by his physicians.
 I would the state of time had first been whole
    Ere he by sickness had been visited.
 Sick now? droop now? This sickness doth infect
    The very lifeblood of our enterprise.
 Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

  Hot.
 Were it good
    To set the exact wealth of all our states
    All at one cast? to set so rich a man
    On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
    It were not good; for therein should we read
    The very bottom and the soul of hope,
    The very list, the very utmost bound
    Of all our fortunes.

  Doug.
 But yet I would your father had been here.

  Hot.
 Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
 No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March,
    This praise doth nourish agues.

    Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
    Meet, and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.

    that Glendower were come!
  Ver.
 Forty let it be.
 Die all, die merrily.


  Fal.

  Bard.
 Will you give me money, Captain?
  Fal.
 Lay out, lay out.

  Fal.
 A mad fellow met me
    on the way, and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and
    press'd the dead bodies.
 I'll
    not march through Coventry with them, that's flat.
 Nay, and the
    villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on;
    for indeed I had the most of them out of prison.
 There's but a
    shirt and a half in all my company; and the half-shirt is two  
    napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a
    herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth,
    stol'n from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose innkeeper
    of Daventry.


  Prince.
 Tut, tut! good enough to toss; food for powder, food for
    powder.
 Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare-
    too beggarly.
 No, I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on the
    ribs bare.
 Percy 's already in the
    field.
 I fear we shall stay too long.
                  Exit.


Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, Vernon.
 We'll fight with him to-night.

  Doug.
 You give him then advantage.
 Why say you so? Looks he no for supply?
  Ver.

  Wor.

  Hot.

  Wor.
  

                 Enter Sir Walter Blunt.

  Blunt.
 The King hath sent to know
    The nature of your griefs; and whereupon
    You conjure from the breast of civil peace
    Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
    Audacious cruelty.

    But.
  
  Blunt.

  Blunt.
 Pray God you do.

  Sir M.

  Arch.
 But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
    And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head
    Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.

  Arch.
 Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well oppos'd.

ACT V.

The King's camp near Shrewsbury.
 The southern wind
    Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
    And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
    Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day.
 Theft with the losers let it sympathize,
    For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
 Enter Worcester [and Vernon].

    This is not well, my lord; this is not well.

    What say you to it? Will you again unknit
    This churlish knot of all-abhorred war,
    And move in that obedient orb again
    Where you did give a fair and natural light,
    And be no more an exhal'd meteor,
    A prodigy of fear, and a portent
    Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
  Wor.

  King.

    To this we swore our aid.

    And never yet did insurrection want
    Such water colours to impaint his cause,
    Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
    Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.
  
    For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
    I have a truant been to chivalry;
    And so I hear he doth account me too.
 No, good Worcester, no!
    We love our people well; even those we love
    That are misled upon your cousin's part;
    And, will they take the offer of our grace,
    Both he, and they, and you, yea, every man
    Shall be my friend again, and I'll be his.
 But if he will not yield,
    Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,
    And they shall do their office.
 It will not be accepted, on my life.

  Prince.

    Say thy prayers, and farewell.
 I would be loath to pay him before his day.
 Yea, but how if honour prick  
    me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? No.
 Or take away the grief of a wound? No.
 A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died a
    Wednesday.
 Doth he feel it? No.
 Therefore I'll
    none of it.





Scene II.
 'Twere best he did.

    My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;  
    It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
    And an adopted name of privilege-
    A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.

    Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.

  Doug.

Exit.
 Did you beg any, God forbid!
  Wor.

  Wor.
 Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
    Upon his follies.
 My lord, prepare.
 The King comes on apace.

Plain between the camps.

  Blunt.
 Where?
  Doug.
 This, Douglas? No.
 A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
    A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
    Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
  Hot.
 I have led my
    rag-of-muffins where they are pepper'd.
 I have paid  
    Percy; I have made him sure.
 He is indeed, and living to kill thee.

  Prince.

  King.
 I will do so.

  West.


  Doug.
 I have two boys  
    Seek Percy and thyself about the field;
    But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
    I will assay thee.


   They fight.


  Prince.

  King.
 Stay and breathe awhile.
 Make up to Clifton; I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
 Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

  Hot.


  Fal.


   Enter Douglas.
 He fighteth with Falstaff, who falls down as if  
      he were dead.
 O Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
    I better brook the loss of brittle life
    Than those proud titles thou hast won of me.
]
  Prince.
 For worms, brave Percy.

    Embowell'd will I see thee by-and-by;
    Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.

  
  Fal.
 To die is to be a
    counterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not
    the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
    liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image
    of life indeed.
 Why may not he rise as well as I?
    Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.


   He takes up Hotspur on his hack.
 Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
    Thy maiden sword.

  Prince.
 I'll take it
    upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh.

  John.

  Prince.

                                           A retreat is sounded.

    Come, brother, let's to the highest of the field,
    To see what friends are living, who are dead.
 At my tent
    The Douglas is, and I beseech Your Grace
    I may dispose of him.

  King.
 With all my heart.

  Prince.

    You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland,
    Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
    To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
    Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.

Warkworth.
 Before NORTHUMBERLAND'S Castle

Enter LORD BARDOLPH

  LORD BARDOLPH.
 What shall I say you are?
  LORD BARDOLPH.
 Tell thou the Earl
    That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 O, such a day,
    So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
    Came not till now to dignify the times,
    Since Cxsar's fortunes!
  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence;  
    A gentleman well bred and of good name,
    That freely rend'red me these news for true.


                         Enter TRAVERS

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
    On Tuesday last to listen after news.
 Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
  TRAVERS.
 Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
    Give then such instances of loss?
  LORD BARDOLPH.
  

                        Enter Morton

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
    Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
    To fright our party.
'
  MORTON.
 Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.

  MORTON.

    In poison there is physic; and these news,
    Having been well, that would have made me sick,
    Being sick, have in some measure made me well;
    And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,
    Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
    Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
    Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
    Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,
    Are thrice themselves.
 Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
    A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
    Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!
    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
    Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.

    Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
    The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
    To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland!
    Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature's hand
    Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!  
    And let this world no longer be a stage
    To feed contention in a ling'ring act;
    But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
    Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
    On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
    And darkness be the burier of the dead!
  LORD BARDOLPH.

  MORTON.
' It was your pre-surmise
    That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
 And, my most noble lord,
    I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:
    The gentle Archbishop of York is up
    With well-appointed pow'rs.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  FALSTAFF.
 Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me.
 I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in
    other men.

    Where's Bardolph?
  PAGE.
 I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
    Smithfield.
 An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were
    mann'd, hors'd, and wiv'd.


              Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT

  PAGE.

  FALSTAFF.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  SERVANT.
 Sir John!
  FALSTAFF.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  FALSTAFF.
 I
    am glad to see your lordship abroad.
 An't please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return'd
    with some discomfort from Wales.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 Rather an't please you, it
    is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that
    I am troubled withal.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 Your means are very slender, and your waste is
    great.
 I would it were otherwise; I would my means were greater
    and my waist slenderer.

  FALSTAFF.
 The young Prince hath misled me.
 I am the fellow with the
    great belly, and he my dog.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 I hear you are
    going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the
    Earl of Northumberland.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle.
 With him, we may.
 Yea, marry, there's the point;
    But if without him we be thought too feeble,
    My judgment is we should not step too far
    Till we had his assistance by the hand;
    For, in a theme so bloody-fac'd as this,
    Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
    Of aids incertain, should not be admitted.
 'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
    It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

  LORD BARDOLPH.
 Yes, if this present quality of war-
    Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot-
    Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
    We see th' appearing buds; which to prove fruit
    Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair
    That frosts will bite them.
 What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?
  HASTINGS.
 So is the unfirm King
    In three divided; and his coffers sound
    With hollow poverty and emptiness.

  HASTINGS.
 What trust is in these times?
    They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die
    Are now become enamour'd on his grave.

 O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.
 Here, here.
 Yea, good Master Snare; I have ent'red him and all.

  SNARE.
 If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
 No, nor I neither; I'll be at your elbow.
 I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
    infinitive thing upon my score.

    Good Master Snare, let him not scape.
 Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the channel.


              Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and his men

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 For what sum?
  HOSTESS.
 How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
    temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not
    ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by
    her own?
  FALSTAFF.
 What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
  HOSTESS.
 Deny it, if thou
    canst.
 Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
    manner of wrenching the true cause the false way.
 It is not a  
    confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more
    than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level
    consideration.
 Pray thee, peace.
 I say to you I do
    desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty
    employment in the King's affairs.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 Come hither, hostess.
 Now, Master Gower, what news?
  GOWER.
 By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain to pawn
    both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers.

  FALSTAFF.

  HOSTESS.
 Let it alone; I'll make other shift.
 You'll be a fool  
    still.
 Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown.
 Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
  FALSTAFF.
 I hope, my lord, all's well.
 My lord!
  CHIEF JUSTICE.
 This is the right fencing grace, my lord; tap for
    tap, and so part fair.

  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  PRINCE.

  PRINCE.
 Belike then my appetite was not-princely got; for, by my
    troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer.
 But
    indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my
    greatness.

  POINS.

  POINS.
 Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you will
    tell.
 Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now
    my father is sick; albeit I could tell to thee- as to one it
    pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend- I could be
    sad and sad indeed too.
 It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed
    fellow to think as every man thinks.
 Never a man's thought in the
    world keeps the road-way better than thine.

  POINS.
 By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it with mine
    own ears.
 'A calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I
    could discern no part of his face from the window.
 Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
  PAGE.
 Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but that moves
    not him.
 Though that be sick, it dies not.
 I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my dog;
    and he holds his place, for look you how he writes.

  PRINCE.
 He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.
 Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits
    of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
 At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.

  PRINCE.
 Sup any women with him?
  PAGE.

  PRINCE.

  PRINCE.
 Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your master that
    I am yet come to town.

  PAGE.
 And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
 Fare you well; go.
 From a prince to a prentice? A low transformation! That
    shall be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with the
    folly.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Before the castle

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
    And but my going nothing can redeem it.

  LADY PERCY.

    He had no legs that practis'd not his gait;
    And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
    Became the accents of the valiant;
    For those who could speak low and tardily
    Would turn their own perfection to abuse
    To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
    In diet, in affections of delight,
    In military rules, humours of blood,
    He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
    That fashion'd others.
 Come, come, go in with me.
 'Tis with my mind
    As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
    That makes a still-stand, running neither way.

    Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,
    But many thousand reasons hold me back.
 The Prince once set a dish
    of apple-johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir
    Johns; and, putting off his hat, said 'I will now take my leave
    of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.
' It ang'red him
    to the heart; but he hath forgot that.

  FRANCIS.
 Why, then, cover and set them down; and see if thou canst
    find out Sneak's noise; Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some
    music.
 Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
    they'll come in straight.
 Bardolph hath brought word.

  THIRD DRAWER.

    Lo, here comes Sir John.
  [Exit FRANCIS]- [Singing]  'And was a worthy king'- How
    now, Mistress Doll!
  HOSTESS.
 So is all her sect; and they be once in a calm, they are
    sick.

  DOLL.
 By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never meet
    but you fall to some discord.
 Sir, Ancient Pistol's below and would speak with you.

  DOLL.

  HOSTESS.
 I am in good
    name and fame with the very best.
 Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John; there comes no
    swaggerers here.
 Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me; and your ancient
    swagg'rer comes not in my doors.
 Receive' says he 'no swaggering
    companions.
 No, I'll no swagg'rers.

                                                    Exit FRANCIS
  HOSTESS.

  DOLL.
 I
    cannot abide swagg'rers.

  DOLL.
 I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
 Away, you bottle-ale rascal! you
    basket-hilt stale juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir?
    God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!
  PISTOL.
 No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here.

  BARDOLPH.

  PISTOL.
 These be good humours, indeed! Shall packhorses,
    And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
    Which cannot go but thirty mile a day,
    Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals,
    And Troiant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with
    King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
 Be gone, good ancient; this will grow to a brawl anon.

  PISTOL.

                                         [Laying down his sword]
    Come we to full points here, and are etceteras nothings?
  FALSTAFF.
 Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat shilling.
 Give me my rapier, boy.

  DOLL.
 Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping house afore
    I'll be in these tirrits and frights.
 Have you turn'd him out a doors?
  BARDOLPH.
 You have hurt him, sir, i'
    th' shoulder.
 A rascal! to brave me!
  DOLL.
 Come on, you whoreson
    chops.
 Do, an thou dar'st for thy heart.
 Peace, good Doll! Do not speak like a death's-head; do
    not bid me remember mine end.
 Sirrah, what humour's the Prince of?
  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
  
  DOLL.
 Why does the Prince love him so, then?
  FALSTAFF.

  PRINCE.
 Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says th'
    almanac to that?  
  POINS.

  FALSTAFF.
 I am old, I am old.
 What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive money a
    Thursday.

  DOLL.
 By my troth, thou't set me a-weeping, an thou say'st so.

  PRINCE & POINS.
  
  PRINCE.
 O, the Lord preserve thy Grace! By my troth, welcome to
    London.
 Now the Lord bless that sweet face of thine.
 Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
    flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
 My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all
    to a merriment, if you take not the heat.

  PRINCE.

  FALSTAFF.
 You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to
    try my patience.
 No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within
    hearing.
  
  PRINCE.

  PRINCE.
 See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not
    make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us? Is
    she of the wicked? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is thy
    boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his
    nose, of the wicked?
  POINS.
 For the boy- there is a good angel about him;
    but the devil outbids him too.
 What's a joint of mutton or two in a
    whole Lent?
  PRINCE.
 Peto, how now! What news?
  PETO.
 By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame
    So idly to profane the precious time,
    When tempest of commotion, like the south,
    Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
    And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
 Falstaff, good night.


                        Exeunt PRINCE, POINS, PETO, and BARDOLPH

  FALSTAFF.
  [Knocking within]  More
    knocking at the door!

                      Re-enter BARDOLPH

    How now! What's the matter?
  BARDOLPH.
 O, run Doll, run, run, good Come.

Westminster.
 Make good speed.
 Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.

  KING.

    'Tis not ten years gone
    Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
    Did feast together, and in two years after
    Were they at wars.

  WARWICK.
 There is a history in all men's lives,
    Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd;
    The which observ'd, a man may prophesy,
    With a near aim, of the main chance of things
    As yet not come to life, who in their seeds
    And weak beginning lie intreasured.

    Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
    The numbers of the feared.
 Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir; give me
    your hand, sir.
 Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
 Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
  SHALLOW.
 By yea and no, sir.
 I dare say my cousin William is become
    a good scholar; he is at Oxford still, is he not?
  SILENCE.
 You were call'd 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
 Dead, sir.
  
  SHALLOW.
 Jesu, Jesu, dead! drew a good bow; and dead! 'A shot a
    fine shoot.
 John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on
    his head.
 Thereafter as they be- a score of good ewes may be worth
    ten pounds.
 My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain, Sir
    John Falstaff- a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant  
    leader.

  SHALLOW.
 He greets me well, sir; I knew him a good back-sword man.
 'Better accommodated!' It is good; yea, indeed, is it.

  BARDOLPH.
 Welcome, good Sir
    John.
 Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the
    peace.
 Fie! this is hot weather.
 Let me see them, I beseech you.

  SHALLOW.
 Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Let
    me see, let me see, let me see.
 So, so, so, so,- so, so- yea,
    marry, sir.
 Rafe Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them do
    so, let them do so.
 Yea, an't please you.
 Very singular good! In faith, well said, Sir
    John; very well said.

  FALSTAFF.
 You need not to have prick'd me; there are
    other men fitter to go out than I.

  FALSTAFF.
 Shadow will serve for summer.

  SHALLOW.
 Is thy name Wart?
  WART.
 Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it.
 Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as
    thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
  FEEBLE.
 I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend
    him and make him fit to go.

  FEEBLE.
 Here, sir.
 Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown.
 You must have
    but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.
 I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
 O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the
    windmill in Saint George's Field?
  FALSTAFF.
 Never, never; she would always say she could not abide
    Master Shallow.

  SHALLOW.
 She was then
    a bona-roba.

  SHALLOW.

  SHALLOW.
 In very
    truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd, sir, as go.
 And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake,
    stand my friend.
 You shall have
    forty, sir.
 Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

  FALSTAFF.
 He
    presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
    level at the edge of a penknife.
 Put me a caliver into
    Wart's hand, Bardolph.
 Traverse- thus, thus, thus.
 Come, manage me your caliver.
 He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it right.
 These fellows will do well.

  FALSTAFF.
 God keep you.
 I do see the bottom of
    justice Shallow.

  ARCHBISHOP.
 West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
    In goodly form comes on the enemy;
    And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
    Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
 Health and fair greeting from our general,
    The Prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
 Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.

    I have in equal balance justly weigh'd  
    What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
    And find our griefs heavier than our offences.

  WESTMORELAND.
 Why not to him in part, and to us all
    That feel the bruises of the days before,
    And suffer the condition of these times
    To lay a heavy and unequal hand
    Upon our honours?
  WESTMORELAND.
 Were you not restor'd
    To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories,
    Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's?
  MOWBRAY.
 you overween to take it so.
 That argues but the shame of your offence:
    A rotten case abides no handling.
  
    I muse you make so slight a question.
 This will I show the general.
 Please you, lords,
    In sight of both our battles we may meet;
    And either end in peace- which God so frame!-
    Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
    Which must decide it.
 My lord, we will do so.

  MOWBRAY.
 Note this: the King is weary
    Of dainty and such picking grievances;
    For he hath found to end one doubt by death
    Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
    And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
    And keep no tell-tale to his memory
    That may repeat and history his los
    To new remembrance.
 'Tis very true;
    And therefore be assur'd, my good Lord Marshal,
    If we do now make our atonement well,
    Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
    Grow stronger for the breaking.
 Who hath not heard it spoken
    How deep you were within the books of God?
    To us the speaker in His parliament,
    To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself,
    The very opener and intelligencer
    Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,
    And our dull workings.
 O, who shall believe
    But you misuse the reverence of your place,
    Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n
    As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
    In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
    Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
    The subjects of His substitute, my father,
    And both against the peace of heaven and him
    Have here up-swarm'd them.
 Good my Lord of Lancaster,
    I am not here against your father's peace;
    But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,
    The time misord'red doth, in common sense,
    Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form  
    To hold our safety up.
 I sent your Grace
    The parcels and particulars of our grief,
    The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,
    Whereon this hydra son of war is born;
    Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
    With grant of our most just and right desires;
    And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
    Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

    If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
    And so success of mischief shall be born,
    And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
    Whiles England shall have generation.

  ARCHBISHOP.
 I give it you, and will maintain my word;
    And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
 Let them have pay, and part.

                                                    Exit Officer
  ARCHBISHOP.
 To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
 I am glad of it.

                                                 [Shouts within]
  PRINCE JOHN.
 My lord, our army is dispers'd already.

  WESTMORELAND.
 Will you thus break your faith?
  PRINCE JOHN.

    Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
    Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.
  
    Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.
          Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Enter FALSTAFF and COLVILLE, meeting

  FALSTAFF.
 My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me.
 Do you
    think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I, in my poor and
    old motion, the expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
    the very extremest inch of possibility; I have found'red nine
    score and odd posts; and here, travel tainted as I am, have, in  
    my pure and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colville of the
    Dale,a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
 Here he is, and here I yield him; and I
    beseech your Grace, let it be book'd with the rest of this day's
    deeds; or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad
    else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colville kissing my
    foot; to the which course if I be enforc'd, if you do not all
    show like gilt twopences to me, and I, in the clear sky of fame,
    o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the
    element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the word
    of the noble.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 Let it shine, then.
 Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good,
    and call it what you will.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 Is thy name Colville?  
  COLVILLE.

  PRINCE JOHN.

  PRINCE JOHN.

                                         Exeunt BLUNT and others
    And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.
 They
    are generally fools and cowards-which some of us should be too,
    but for inflammation.
 The second property of
    your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood; which before,
    cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the
    badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it,
    and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes.
 It
    illumineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the
    rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital
    commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their
    captain, the heart, who, great and puff'd up with this retinue,
    doth any deed of courage- and this valour comes of sherris.


                           Enter BARDOLPH

    How now, Bardolph!
  BARDOLPH.
 The army is discharged all and gone.
                                  Exeunt




SCENE IV.

    Only we want a little personal strength;
    And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,
    Come underneath the yoke of government.

  KING.

  KING.
 Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
  PRINCE HUMPHREY.

    He hath a tear for pity and a hand
    Open as day for melting charity;
    Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, he is flint;
    As humorous as winter, and as sudden  
    As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
  
  KING.

  HARCOURT.
 From enemies heaven keep your Majesty;
    And, when they stand against you, may they fall
    As those that I am come to tell you of!
    The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
    With a great power of English and of Scots,
    Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.
 And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
    Will Fortune never come with both hands full,
    But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
    She either gives a stomach and no food-
    Such are the poor, in health- or else a feast,  
    And takes away the stomach- such are the rich
    That have abundance and enjoy it not.
 O my royal father!
  WESTMORELAND.

  WARWICK.
 Be patient, Princes; you do know these fits
    Are with his Highness very ordinary.
 Another chamber

The KING lying on a bed; CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK,
and others in attendance

  KING.
 Call for the music in the other room.
 How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!
    How doth the King?
  PRINCE HUMPHREY.
 Exceeding ill.

  PRINCE.
 If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.
 Not so much noise, my lords.
 Doth the King call?  
  WARWICK.

  KING.
 The Prince of Wales! Where is he? Let me see him.

  WARWICK.
 This door is open; he is gone this way.
 See, sons, what things you are!
    How quickly nature falls into revolt
    When gold becomes her object!
    For this the foolish over-careful fathers  
    Have broke their sleep with thoughts,
    Their brains with care, their bones with industry;
    For this they have engrossed and pil'd up
    The cank'red heaps of strange-achieved gold;
    For this they have been thoughtful to invest
    Their sons with arts and martial exercises;
    When, like the bee, tolling from every flower
    The virtuous sweets,
    Our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey pack'd,
    We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,
    Are murd'red for our pains.
 This bitter taste
    Yields his engrossments to the ending father.
 Come hither to me, Harry.

    What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
    Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself;
    And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
    That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.

    England shall double gild his treble guilt;
    England shall give him office, honour, might;
    For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks
    The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
    Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.

    Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!
  PRINCE.
 There is your crown,
    And he that wears the crown immortally
    Long guard it yours!  [Kneeling]  If I affect it more
    Than as your honour and as your renown,
    Let me no more from this obedience rise,
    Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
    Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending!
    God witness with me, when I here came in
    And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
    How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
    O, let me in my present wildness die,
    And never live to show th' incredulous world
    The noble change that I have purposed!
    Coming to look on you, thinking you dead-
    And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
    I spake unto this crown as having sense,
    And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
    Hath fed upon the body of my father;
    Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.
 God knows, my son,
    By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
    I met this crown; and I myself know well
    How troublesome it sat upon my head:
    To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
    Better opinion, better confirmation;
    For all the soil of the achievement goes
    With me into the earth.
 And now my death
    Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd
    Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;  
    So thou the garland wear'st successively.

    Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
    Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
    And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
    Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
    By whose fell working I was first advanc'd,
    And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
    To be again displac'd; which to avoid,
    I cut them off; and had a purpose now
    To lead out many to the Holy Land,
    Lest rest and lying still might make them look
    Too near unto my state.
 Therefore, my Harry,
    Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
    With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,
    May waste the memory of the former days.

    More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
    That strength of speech is utterly denied me.

    How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
    And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
  PRINCE.


       Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WARWICK, LORDS, and others

  KING.
 Upon thy sight
    My worldly business makes a period.
 SHALLOW'S house

Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and PAGE

  SHALLOW.
 You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
 Why, Davy!

                            Enter DAVY

  DAVY.
 With red wheat, Davy.

  SHALLOW.
 Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
  SHALLOW.

  SHALLOW.

  DAVY.

  DAVY.
 I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God
    forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his
    friend's request.
 Come, Sir John.

    [Exit SHALLOW]  Bardolph, look to our horses.
 It is
    certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught,
    as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed
    of their company.
 O, it is much that a lie with a slight
    oath, and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
    had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh till
    his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
  SHALLOW.
 Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
 He's walk'd the way of nature;
    And to our purposes he lives no more.

  WARWICK.
 Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry.

    O that the living Harry had the temper
    Of he, the worst of these three gentlemen!
    How many nobles then should hold their places
    That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
  CHIEF JUSTICE.

  GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE.

  PRINCE JOHN.
 We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
 Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
  PRINCE HUMPHREY.
 This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
    Sits not so easy on me as you think.

    Sorrow so royally in you appears
    That I will deeply put the fashion on,
    And wear it in my heart.

    For me, by heaven, I bid you be assur'd,
    I'll be your father and your brother too;
    Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
 You all look strangely on me; and you most.
 I am assur'd, if I be measur'd rightly,
    Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

    Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
    Be now the father, and propose a son;
    Hear your own dignity so much profan'd,
    See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
    Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
    And then imagine me taking your part
    And, in your power, soft silencing your son.

    After this cold considerance, sentence me;
    And, as you are a king, speak in your state
    What I have done that misbecame my place,
    My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
               Exeunt




SCENE III.

  FALSTAFF.

  SHALLOW.
 Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all, Sir John
    -marry, good air.
 By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper.
 Now sit down, now sit down; come, cousin.
 There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll give you
    a health for that anon.

 Exit
  SHALLOW.
  

  FALSTAFF.
 I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this
    mettle.
 Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.


                          Re-enter DAVY

  DAVY.
  [To BARDOLPH]
    A cup of wine, sir?
  SILENCE.
  [Singing]

         A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
         And drink unto the leman mine;
           And a merry heart lives long-a.
 An I might see you there, Davy!
  SHALLOW.


    Is't not so?
  FALSTAFF.
 'Tis so.
 Sweet knight,
    thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.
 By'r lady, I think 'a be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
 Puff!
    Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
    Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
    And helter-skelter have I rode to thee;
    And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,
    And golden times, and happy news of price.
  [Singing]  And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
 Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
 Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or die.

  SHALLOW.
 Under King Harry.

  PISTOL.

  FALSTAFF.

  PISTOL.
 Blessed are
    they that have been my friends; and woe to my Lord Chief Justice!
  PISTOL.
 No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might die,
    that I might have thee hang'd.
 Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of
    joint.
 The constables have delivered her over to me; and she
    shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant her.
 Come, I charge you both go with me; for
    the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.
 O God, that right should thus overcome might!
    Well, of sufferance comes ease.
                                Exeunt

  THIRD GROOM.
 'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the
    coronation.
 Dispatch, dispatch.
 Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will make the
    King do you grace.

  PISTOL.
 Come here, Pistol; stand behind me.
 My devotion-
  SHALLOW.
 As it were, to ride day and night; and not to deliberate,
    not to remember, not to have patience to shift me-
  SHALLOW.
' 'Tis all in
    every part.
 'Tis so, indeed.
 I will deliver her.
 God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  PISTOL.

    Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
    Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
    For thee thrice wider than for other men-
    Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
    Presume not that I am the thing I was,
    For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
    That I have turn'd away my former self;
    So will I those that kept me company.
 Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me have
    home with me.

  FALSTAFF.
 Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
    Take all his company along with him.

  PRINCE JOHN.


  First my fear, then my curtsy, last my speech.

  If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to
use my legs? And yet that were but light payment-to dance out of
your debt.

   Suppose within the girdle of these walls  
   Are now confin'd two mighty monarchies,
   Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
   The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
 SCENE I.
 My lord, I'll tell you: that self bill is urg'd
   Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign
   Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd
   But that the scambling and unquiet time
   Did push it out of farther question.

 ELY.

 ELY.

 CANTERBURY.

 ELY.

   The breath no sooner left his father's body  
   But that his wildness, mortified in him,
   Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment,
   Consideration like an angel came
   And whipp'd th' offending Adam out of him,
   Leaving his body as a paradise
   T'envelop and contain celestial spirits.
 We are blessed in the change.

 CANTERBURY.
 It must be so; for miracles are ceas'd;
   And therefore we must needs admit the means  
   How things are perfected.

 ELY.
 The French ambassador upon that instant
   Crav'd audience; and the hour, I think, is come  
   To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
 ELY.
 Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
  EXETER.
 Not here in presence.
 Send for him, good uncle.

  WESTMORELAND.

    My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
    And justly and religiously unfold  
    Why the law Salique, that they have in France,
    Or should or should not bar us in our claim;
    And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
    That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
    Or nicely charge your understanding soul
    With opening titles miscreate whose right
    Suits not in native colours with the truth;
    For God doth know how many, now in health,
    Shall drop their blood in approbation
    Of what your reverence shall incite us to.

    Under this conjuration speak, my lord;
    For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,  
    That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
    As pure as sin with baptism.
 Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
    That owe yourselves, your lives, and services,
    To this imperial throne.

    Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
    Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male  
    Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
    To find his title with some shows of truth-
    Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught-
    Convey'd himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare,
    Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
    To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
    Of Charles the Great.
 Also King Lewis the Tenth,
    Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
    Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
    Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
    That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
    Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
    Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;
    By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
    Was re-united to the Crown of France.
  
    O noble English, that could entertain
    With half their forces the full pride of France,
    And let another half stand laughing by,
    All out of work and cold for action!
  ELY.
 We must not only arm t' invade the French,
    But lay down our proportions to defend
    Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
    With all advantages.
 They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
    Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
    Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

    While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
    Th' advised head defends itself at home;
    For government, though high, and low, and lower,
    Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
    Congreeing in a full and natural close,
    Like music.
 Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.

  AMBASSADOR.
 May't please your Majesty to give us leave
    Freely to render what we have in charge;
    Or shall we sparingly show you far of
    The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
  KING HENRY.
 This the Dauphin speaks.
 Tennis-balls, my liege.

    When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,  
    We will in France, by God's grace, play a set
    Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.

    Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
    That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
    With chaces.

    But this lies all within the will of God,
    To whom I do appeal; and in whose name,
    Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on,
    To venge me as I may and to put forth
    My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.

    Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour  
    That may give furth'rance to our expedition;
    For we have now no thought in us but France,
    Save those to God, that run before our business.

SCENE I.

  BARDOLPH.
 It is certain, Corporal, that he is married to Nell
    Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were
    troth-plight to her.
 I cannot tell; things must be as they may.
 Good Corporal, be
    patient here.

  BARDOLPH.
 Pish!  
  PISTOL.

  PISTOL.
 'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
    The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
    The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
    And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy;
    And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
    I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
    For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
    And flashing fire will follow.
 I thee defy again.

    O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
    No; to the spital go,
    And from the powd'ring tub of infamy
    Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
    Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse.
 Good Bardolph, put
    thy face between his sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan.
 By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these
    days: the King has kill'd his heart.
 Good husband, come home
    presently.
                            Exeunt HOSTESS and BOY
  BARDOLPH.
 Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
    together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
    another's throats?
  PISTOL.
 You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
  PISTOL.
 That now I will have; that's the humour of it.
 As manhood shall compound: push home.

  PISTOL.
 A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
    And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
    And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.
 As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.

  KING HENRY.

  SCROOP.
 We consider
    It was excess of wine that set him on;
    And on his more advice we pardon him.

  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 I one, my lord.
 So did you me, my liege.
 I do confess my fault,
    And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.

  KING HENRY.

    You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
    For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
    As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.

    See you, my princes and my noble peers,
    These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here-
    You know how apt our love was to accord
    To furnish him with an appertinents
    Belonging to his honour; and this man
    Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir'd,
    And sworn unto the practices of France
    To kill us here in Hampton; to the which
    This knight, no less for bounty bound to us  
    Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.
 Or are they spare in diet,
    Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,  
    Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
    Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
    Not working with the eye without the ear,
    And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
    Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem;
    And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
    To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
    With some suspicion.
 I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl
      of Cambridge.
 Never did faithful subject more rejoice
    At the discovery of most dangerous treason
    Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
    Prevented from a damned enterprise.
 God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.

                     Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP, and GREY, guarded
    Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
    Shall be to you as us like glorious.

    We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
    Since God so graciously hath brought to light
    This dangerous treason, lurking in our way
    To hinder our beginnings; we doubt not now
    But every rub is smoothed on our way.

  HOSTESS.
 Ay, that 'a did.

  BARDOLPH.
 And of women.

  HOSTESS.
 Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's
    all the riches I got in his service.

    And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.

 O peace, Prince Dauphin!
    You are too much mistaken in this king.

  FRENCH KING.
 Ambassadors from Harry King of England
    Do crave admittance to your Majesty.
 Or else what follows?

 For us, we will consider of this further;
    To-morrow shall you bear our full intent

  KING.

    In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
    As modest stillness and humility;
    But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
    Then imitate the action of the tiger:
    Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
    Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
    Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
    Let it pry through the portage of the head
    Like the brass cannon: let the brow o'erwhelm it
    As fearfully as doth a galled rock
    O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
    Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.

    Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
    And teach them how to war.
 The game's afoot:
    Follow your spirit; and upon this charge
    Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'
                           [Exeunt.
 Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for

 The town is beseech'd, and the

    nothing.
 'Tis shame for us all, so God sa' me, 'tis shame to

    cut, and works to be done; and there ish nothing done, so Chrish

 And I'll pay't as valorously as I may, that

 I do not know you so good a man as myself; so
    Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
 Ah! that's a foul fault.

SCENE III.

Before the gates of Harfleur

Enter the GOVERNOR and some citizens on the walls.
  Enter the KING
and all his train before the gates

  KING HENRY.
 Our expectation hath this day an end:
    The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,
    Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
    To raise so great a siege.
 For us, dear uncle,
    The winter coming on, and sickness growing
    Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.

Enter KATHERINE and ALICE

 De hand.
 La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres.
 Je pense que
    je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots d'Anglais vitement.
 Les ongles? Nous les appelons de nails.

  KATHERINE.
 Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
 O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! D'elbow.

  KATHERINE.

  KATHERINE.
 Le foot, madame; et le count.

  ALICE.
 C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.
 Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
    Mort Dieu, ma vie! if they march along
    Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom
    To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm
    In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

  FRENCH KING.
 Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence;  
    Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.

  CONSTABLE.
  
    Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
    His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march;
    For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
    He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
    And for achievement offer us his ransom.

  DAUPHIN.

    Now forth, Lord Constable and Princes all,
    And quickly bring us word of England's fall.
 I assure you there is very excellent services committed
    at the bridge.

  GOWER.
 Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
  FLUELLEN.
 The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a
    man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my
    duty, and my live, and my living, and my uttermost power.

  
                            Enter PISTOL

  FLUELLEN.
 Fortune is painted
    blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that
    Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to
    signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning,
    and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look
    you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and
    rolls.
 In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description
    of it: Fortune is an excellent moral.

  PISTOL.

    or else you may be marvellously mistook.
 Ay, so please your Majesty.

  KING HENRY.
 What men have you lost, Fluellen!
  FLUELLEN.
 We would have all such offenders so cut off.
 For our losses his exchequer is too
    poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom
    too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling
    at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.

  KING HENRY.

  MONTJOY.
 Yet forgive me, God,
    That I do brag thus; this your air of France
    Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.

    So tell your master.
 I shall deliver so.

    March to the bridge, it now draws toward night;
    Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
    And on to-morrow bid them march away.
                 Exeunt




SCENE VII.
 You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his
    due.
 It is the best horse of Europe.

  ORLEANS.
 It is a beast for Perseus:
    he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water
    never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his
    rider mounts him; he is indeed a horse, and all other jades you
    may call beasts.
 Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
    horse.

  ORLEANS.
 Mine was not bridled.

  DAUPHIN.

  CONSTABLE.
 I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

 'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.
 He longs to eat the English.
 I think he will eat all he kills.
 By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

  CONSTABLE.
 Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
 He is simply the most active gentleman of France.

  CONSTABLE.
 Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.

  CONSTABLE.

  ORLEANS.
 That island of England breeds very valiant creatures;
    their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

  ORLEANS.
 Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to
    eat, and none to fight.
 Come, shall we
    about it?
  ORLEANS.
 PROLOGUE.
 The poor condemned English,
    Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
    Sit patiently and inly ruminate
    The morning's danger; and their gesture sad
    Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
    Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
    So many horrid ghosts.

    Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
    And make a moral of the devil himself.


                        Enter ERPINGHAM

    Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
    A good soft pillow for that good white head  
    Were better than a churlish turf of France.

 Know'st thou Fluellen?
  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 And his kinsman too.
 My name is Pistol call'd.
 I pray you and beseech you that you will.

  WILLIAMS.
 Under what captain serve you?
  KING HENRY.

  WILLIAMS.
 Even as men wreck'd upon a sand, that look to be wash'd
    off the next tide.

  BATES.
 He hath not told his thought to the King?
  KING HENRY.
 By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I
    think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.

  BATES.
 But this is not so:
    the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his  
    soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant;
    for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
    services.
 You'll never trust
    his word after! Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
 How shall I know thee again?
  KING HENRY.

  WILLIAMS.

  KING HENRY.
 My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
    Seek through your camp to find you.


                         Enter GLOUCESTER

  GLOUCESTER.


                        Enter CONSTABLE

    Now, my Lord Constable!
  CONSTABLE.
 Hark how our steeds for present service neigh!
  DAUPHIN.

    'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
    That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants-
    Who in unnecessary action swarm
    About our squares of battle- were enow
    To purge this field of, such a hilding foe;
    Though we upon this mountain's basis by
    Took stand for idle speculation-  
    But that our honours must not.

    The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
    With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
    Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
    The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,  
    And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit
    Lies foul with chaw'd grass, still and motionless;
    And their executors, the knavish crows,
    Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.
 The King himself is rode to view their battle.

  EXETER.

    God bye you, Princes all; I'll to my charge.
 Fight valiantly to-day;
    And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
    For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour.

                                                  Exit SALISBURY
  BEDFORD.
 He is as full of valour as of kindness;  
    Princely in both.

  WESTMORELAND.

    God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.

    But if it be a sin to covet honour,
    I am the most offending soul alive.

    He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
    Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
    And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
 Then shall our names,  
    Familiar in his mouth as household words-
    Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
    Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester-
    Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.
 All things are ready, if our minds be so.
 God be with you all!

                     Tucket.
 I pray thee bear my former answer back:
    Bid them achieve me, and then sell my bones.

    A many of our bodies shall no doubt
    Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
    Shall witness live in brass of this day's work.

    Mark then abounding valour in our English,  
    That, being dead, like to the bullet's grazing
    Break out into a second course of mischief,
    Killing in relapse of mortality.
 I shall, King Harry.

    Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark:
    O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
    Except, O Signieur, thou do give to me
    Egregious ransom.
 Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;
    Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
    In drops of crimson blood.

  BOY.
 Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?

 Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.
  
  FRENCH SOLDIER.
 Gardez ma vie, et
    je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.
 What are his words?
  BOY.
 He prays you to save his life; he is a gentleman of a good
    house, and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns.
 Petit monsieur, que dit-il?
  BOY.
 Expound unto me, boy.
 As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.

    Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring
    devil i' th' old play, that every one may pare his nails with a
    wooden dagger; and they are both hang'd; and so would this be, if
    he durst steal anything adventurously.
 The French might have a
    good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is none to guard it
    but boys.

Another part of the field of battle

Enter CONSTABLE, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES

  CONSTABLE.

    Let life be short, else shame will be too long.

  KING HENRY.

    My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;  
    Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast;
    As in this glorious and well-foughten field
    We kept together in our chivalry.
 'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the cowardly
    rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter;
    besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the
    King's tent; wherefore the King most worthily hath caus'd every
    soldier to cut his prisoner's throat.
 Alexander the Great.
 Why, I pray you, is not 'pig' great? The pig, or great,
    or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one
    reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.

    Alexander- God knows, and you know- in his rages, and his furies,
    and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
    displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little
    intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look
    you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

  GOWER.
 Sir John Falstaff.

  FLUELLEN.
 That is he.


            Alarum.
 I was not angry since I came to France
    Until this instant.
 Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
 O, give us leave, great King,
    To view the field in safety, and dispose
    Of their dead bodies!
  KING HENRY.

  MONTJOY.
 The day is yours.
 Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
    What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?
  MONTJOY.

  KING HENRY.
 Your Majesty says very true; if your Majesties is  
    rememb'red of it, the Welshmen did good service in garden where
    leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps; which your
    Majesty know to this hour is an honourable badge of the service;
    and I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek
    upon Saint Tavy's day.
 By Jeshu, I am your Majesty's countryman, care not who
    know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I need not be
    asham'd of your Majesty, praised be Got, so long as your Majesty
    is an honest man.

  KING HENRY.
 An't please your Majesty, a rascal that swagger'd with me
    last night; who, if 'a live and ever dare to challenge this
    glove, I have sworn to take him a box o' th' ear; or if I can see
    my glove in his cap- which he swore, as he was a soldier, he
    would wear if alive- I will strike it out soundly.
 He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your
    Majesty, in my conscience.

  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 Under Captain Gower, my liege.

  KING HENRY.
 I would fain see the man that has but  
    two legs that shall find himself aggrief'd at this glove, that is
    all; but I would fain see it once, an please God of his grace
    that I might see.
 He is my dear friend, an please you.
 Follow, good cousin Warwick;
    If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
    By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
    Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
    For I do know Fluellen valiant,
    And touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder,
    And quickly will return an injury;
    Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
  
    Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

  WILLIAMS.
 My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look
    your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out
    of the helmet of Alencon.
 Give me thy glove, soldier; look, here is the fellow of
      it.

    'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
    And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
 Keep it, fellow;
    And wear it for an honour in thy cap
    Till I do challenge it.
 Give him the crowns;
    And, Captain, you must needs be friends with him.
 'Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or
    I will change it.
 Here is the number of the slaught'red French.

                                                 [Gives a paper]
  KING HENRY.
 When, without stratagem,
    But in plain shock and even play of battle,
    Was ever known so great and little los
    On one part and on th' other? Take it, God,  
    For it is none but thine.

  FLUELLEN.

  FLUELLEN.

  KING HENRY.
 Do we all holy rites:
    Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum';

    His bruised helmet and his bended sword  
    Before him through the city.

    Then brook abridgment; and your eyes advance,
    After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
 Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.

 Enough, Captain, you have astonish'd him.
 Must I bite?

 Quiet thy cudgel: thou dost see I eat.
 Me a groat!

 Will you mock

    worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour, and dare not
    avouch in your deeds any of your words? I have seen you gleeking
    and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice.
 You thought,

  BURGUNDY.
 If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace
    Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections
    Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
    With full accord to all our just demands;
    Whose tenours and particular effects
    You have, enschedul'd briefly, in your hands.

 Well then, the peace,
    Which you before so urg'd, lies in his answer.

 What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men are
    full of deceits?
  ALICE.
 But, before God, Kate, I
    cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my cloquence, nor I have no
    cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use
    till urg'd, nor never break for urging.
 No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure
    will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her
    husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.

  KING HENRY.
 No, faith, is't not, Kate; but thy speaking of my
    tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must needs be granted to
    be much at one.
 I cannot tell.

  KING HENRY.
 But, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
    rather, gentle Princess, because I love thee cruelly.
 No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise; do but
    now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your French part of
    such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and
    a bachelor.
 How answer you, la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon

  BURGUNDY.
 I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I
    love her; and that is good English.

  BURGUNDY.
 Is she not apt?
  KING HENRY.
 If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if
    conjure up love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked
    and blind.
 Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet ros'd over
    with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of
    a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a  
    hard condition for a maid to consign to.

  KING HENRY.
 This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and
    so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she
    must be blind too.

 Now, welcome, Kate; and bear me witness all,
    That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

    Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,
    And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be!

  CHORUS.

    Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd king
    Of France and England, did this king succeed;
    Whose state so many had the managing
    That they lost France and made his England bleed;
    Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,
    In your fair minds let this acceptance take.

    What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:
    He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.

    Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,
    Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.
 How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?
  MESSENGER.
 No treachery, but want of men and money.
 Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
 Lords, view these letters full of bad
    mischance.


                   Enter a third MESSENGER

  THIRD MESSENGER.
 My gracious lords, to add to your
    laments,
    Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
    I must inform you of a dismal fight
    Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
 O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was
    o'erthrown.

    The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.

    More than three hours the fight continued;
    Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,
    Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
    Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
    Here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew
    The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
    All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
 His ransom there is none but I shall pay.

    Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
    Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
    To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.
              Exit
  WINCHESTER.

    But long I will not be Jack out of office.
 Why live we idly here?
    Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;  
    Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,
    And he may well in fretting spend his gall
    Nor men nor money hath he to make war.

  CHARLES.

  REIGNIER.

  ALENCON.

    Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
    The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.

    By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
 Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
    Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
    I know thee well, though never seen before.

    Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
 She takes upon her bravely at first dash.

  PUCELLE.

  PUCELLE.
 And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man.

  CHARLES.

  ALENCON.
 Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
    Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
 Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
  ALENCON.
 My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
    Shall we give o'er Orleans, or no?
  PUCELLE.

    Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
    Since I have entered into these wars.

    Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
    How may I reverently worship thee enough?
  ALENCON.
 Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
    Drive them from Orleans, and be immortaliz'd.
 Come, let's away about it.

    No prophet will I trust if she prove false.
  [Within]  Who's there that knocks so
    imperiously?
  FIRST SERVING-MAN.
 It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.

  SECOND WARDER.
  [Within]  The Lord protect him! so we
    answer him.
  [Within]  What noise is this? What traitors
    have we here?
  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Open the gates unto the Lord Protector,
    Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
 Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
    Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord;
    Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin.

    I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
    If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
 Nay, stand thou back; I will not budge a foot.
  
  GLOUCESTER.

  WINCHESTER.
 Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens;
    One that still motions war and never peace,
    O'ercharging your free purses with large fines;
    That seeks to overthrow religion,
    Because he is Protector of the realm,
    And would have armour here out of the Tower,
    To crown himself King and suppress the Prince.

    Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,
    Cry.

  WINCHESTER.

    This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
 Mayor, farewell; thou dost but what thou
    mayst.

  WINCHESTER.

               Enter, on the walls, the MASTER-GUNNER
                       OF ORLEANS and his BOY

  MASTER-GUNNER.

  MASTER-GUNNER.
              Exit

          Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets, with
            SIR WILLIAM GLANSDALE, SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE,
                            and others

  SALISBURY.
 Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
    How wert thou handled being prisoner?
    Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd?
    Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.

  TALBOT.
 What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.

    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;  
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.

                  [Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]
  TALBOT.
 Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan.

    Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you.

    Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
    And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
 Then enter TALBOT

  TALBOT.

  PUCELLE.
 Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
    My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage.

             [A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers]
    O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.

    Go, go, cheer up thy hungry starved men;
    Help Salisbury to make his testament.

                                 [Alarum.
 Here another skirmish]
    It will not be-retire into your trenches.

    O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
    The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
 Advance our waving colours on the walls;
    Rescu'd is Orleans from the English.

    More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
  
  ALENCON.

  ALENCON.
 I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
 Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?
    At all times will you have my power alike?
    Sleeping or waking, must I still prevail
    Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
    Improvident soldiers! Had your watch been good  
    This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.

 Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him?

    Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
    To give their censure of these rare reports.
 What! is this the man?  
  MESSENGER.

    Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
    It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
    Should strike such terror to his enemies.

  TALBOT.

 Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
    I go to certify her Talbot's here.

 Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster
    The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
    The outward composition of his body.

    What you have done hath not offended me.
 Great lords and gentlemen, what means this
    silence?
    Dare no man answer in a case of truth?

  SOMERSET.
 Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
  SOMERSET.
 Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
    roses;
    For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
    The truth on our side.

  SOMERSET.
 No, Plantagenet,
    'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
    Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
    And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
 Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
  PLANTAGENET.
 Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
    That shall maintain what I have said is true,
    Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
 Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.

  PLANTAGENET.
 Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and
    thee.
 I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.

  SOMERSET.

  SOMERSET.
 Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition!
    And so farewell until I meet thee next.
 Have with thee, Pole.
 This blot that they object against your house
    Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament,
    Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
    And if thou be not then created York,
    I will not live to be accounted Warwick.

  PLANTAGENET.
 I dare say
    This quarrel will drink blood another day.


                       The Tower of London

         Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and GAOLERS

  MORTIMER.

    These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
    Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
    Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
    And pithless arms, like to a withered vine
    That droops his sapless branches to the ground.
  
    But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
  FIRST KEEPER.

    But now the arbitrator of despairs,
    Just Death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
    With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.

    This day, in argument upon a case,
    Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
    Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
    And did upbraid me with my father's death;
    Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
    Else with the like I had requited him.

  PLANTAGENET.
 Discover more at large what cause that was,
    For I am ignorant and cannot guess.

    The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
    Was, for that-young Richard thus remov'd,
    Leaving no heir begotten of his body-
    I was the next by birth and parentage;  
    For by my mother I derived am
    From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son
    To King Edward the Third; whereas he
    From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
    Being but fourth of that heroic line.
 Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  
  MORTIMER.

    Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;
    But yet be wary in thy studious care.
 Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.

  MORTIMER.
 With silence, nephew, be thou politic;
    Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster
    And like a mountain not to be remov'd.

    Keepers, convey him hence; and I myself
    Will see his burial better than his life.

                Exeunt GAOLERS, hearing out the body of MORTIMER
    Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
    Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort;
    And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
    Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house,
    I doubt not but with honour to redress;
    And therefore haste I to the Parliament,
    Either to be restored to my blood,
    Or make my ill th' advantage of my good.

 Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,
    With written pamphlets studiously devis'd?
    Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse
    Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
    Do it without invention, suddenly;
    I with sudden and extemporal speech
    Purpose to answer what thou canst object.

    Thou art a most pernicious usurer;
    Froward by nature, enemy to peace;
    Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
    A man of thy profession and degree;
    And for thy treachery, what's more manifest
    In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,
    As well at London Bridge as at the Tower?
    Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
    The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
    From envious malice of thy swelling heart.

  KING HENRY.
 We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
    To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace.

  FIRST SERVING-MAN.
 Ay, and the very parings of our nails
    Shall pitch a field when we are dead.

    For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;
    What, shall a child instruct you what to do?

  THIRD SERVING-MAN.
 Let Richard be restored to his blood;
    So shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd.

  KING HENRY.
 If Richard will be true, not that alone
    But all the whole inheritance I give
    That doth belong unto the house of York,
    From whence you spring by lineal descent.
  
    Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
    And rise created princely Duke of York.

  PLANTAGENET.
 And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
    And as my duty springs, so perish they
    That grudge one thought against your Majesty!
  ALL.
  [Aside]  Perish, base Prince, ignoble Duke of
    York!

  KING HENRY.

    Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth
    Was in the mouth of every sucking babe:
    That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,
    And Henry born at Windsor should lose all.

    Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
    His days may finish ere that hapless time.
 These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
    Through which our policy must make a breach.

    If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
    And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
    I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
    That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.

    And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
    But gather we our forces out of hand
    And set upon our boasting enemy.
 Ay,
    All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.

    What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
    They that of late were daring with their scoffs
    Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.

  TALBOT.
 What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.

    Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
    And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
    We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
    If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd.

 Look on thy country, look on fertile France,  
    And see the cities and the towns defac'd
    By wasting ruin of the cruel foe;
    As looks the mother on her lowly babe
    When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
    See, see the pining malady of France;
    Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
    Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.

  BURGUNDY.
 Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
    Or nature makes me suddenly relent.

    See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen,
    And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.

    Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord;
    Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
 I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
    Have batt'red me like roaring cannon-shot
    And made me almost yield upon my knees.
 And doth beget new courage in our breasts.

  ALENCON.

    Long since we were resolved of your truth,
    Your faithful service, and your toil in war;
    Yet never have you tasted our reward,

 When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
    Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,
    Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
    Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
    Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,
    But always resolute in most extremes.
  [Viewing the superscription]  What means his

    Pretend some alteration in good-will?
    What's here?  [Reads]  'I have, upon especial cause,
    Mov'd with compassion of my country's wreck,
    Together with the pitiful complaints
    Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
    Forsaken your pernicious faction,
    And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.

    O monstrous treachery! Can this be so
    That in alliance, amity, and oaths,
    There should be found such false dissembling guile?
  KING HENRY.
 It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
 Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with
    him
    And give him chastisement for this abuse.
 Content, my liege! Yes; but that I am prevented,
    I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
 Then gather strength and march unto him
    straight;
    Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason.

  TALBOT.
 Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
 And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.

  BASSET.

  KING HENRY.
 Crossing the sea from England into France,
    This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
    Upbraided me about the rose I wear,
    Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
    Did represent my master's blushing cheeks
    When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
    About a certain question in the law
    Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;
    With other vile and ignominious terms
    In confutation of which rude reproach
    And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
    I crave the benefit of law of arms.
 Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
    Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.

  YORK.

    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd  
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.

    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.

    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.

    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.

  YORK.

    But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
    This jarring discord of nobility,
    This shouldering of each other in the court,
    This factious bandying of their favourites,
    But that it doth presage some ill event.
 Before Bordeaux

                   Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum

  TALBOT.
 Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter;
    Summon their general unto the wall.

    Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,  
    Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!
    This is the latest glory of thy praise
    That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;
    For ere the glass that now begins to run
    Finish the process of his sandy hour,
    These eyes that see thee now well coloured
    Shall see thee withered, bloody, pale, and dead.
             Exit
  TALBOT.
  
    God comfort him in this necessity!
    If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.


                      Enter SIR WILLIAM LUCY

  LUCY.

    To Bordeaux, warlike Duke! to Bordeaux, York!
    Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.

  YORK.

  LUCY.
 He dies; we lose; I break my warlike word.

    Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can
    But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.

    This expedition was by York and Talbot
    Too rashly plotted; all our general force
    Might with a sally of the very town
    Be buckled with.


                       Enter SIR WILLIAM LUCY

  SOMERSET.

    Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
    Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,
    And Talbot perisheth by your default.
 And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,
    Swearing that you withhold his levied host,  
    Collected for this expedition.

    I owe him little duty and less love,
    And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.

  LUCY.
       Exeunt


                               SCENE 5.
 O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
    To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
    That Talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
    When sapless age and weak unable limbs
    Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
 Fly to revenge my death, if I be slain.

  TALBOT.

  JOHN.
 And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
    No more can I be severed from your side
    Than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide.
         Exeunt




                             SCENE 6.


                         A field of battle

         Alarum: excursions wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemm'd
                  about, and TALBOT rescues him

  TALBOT.

    The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word
    And left us to the rage of France his sword.
 When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck
    fire,
    It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
    Of bold-fac'd victory.
 Enter old TALBOT led by a SERVANT

  TALBOT.
 Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.

    O thou whose wounds become hard-favoured Death,
    Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
    Brave Death by speaking, whether he will or no;
    Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.

    Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
    Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
 Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
    We should have found a bloody day of this.

  BURGUNDY.

  CHARLES.

    I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en,
    And to survey the bodies of the dead.
 For prisoners ask'st thou? Hell our prison is.
 Here's a silly-stately style indeed!
    The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
    Writes not so tedious a style as this.

  PUCELLE.
 SCENE 1.
 The palace

Sennet.
 I have, my lord; and their intent is this:
    They humbly sue unto your Excellence
    To have a godly peace concluded of
    Between the realms of England and of France.
 Well, my good lord, and as the only means
    To stop effusion of our Christian blood
    And stablish quietness on every side.
 Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought
    It was both impious and unnatural
    That such immanity and bloody strife
    Should reign among professors of one faith.

    I shall be well content with any choice
    Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.

    Your purpose is both good and reasonable,
    And therefore are we certainly resolv'd
    To draw conditions of a friendly peace,
    Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
    Shall be transported presently to France.
  [To AMBASSADOR]  In argument and proof of
    which contract,
    Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.

  
                        Exeunt all but WINCHESTER and the LEGATE
  WINCHESTER.
 I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.

    Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
    That neither in birth or for authority
    The Bishop will be overborne by thee.
                   Exeunt


                              SCENE 2.
 Success unto our valiant general,
    And happiness to his accomplices!
  CHARLES.

  SCOUT.

  BURGUNDY.
 Of all base passions fear is most accurs'd.
 Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
                                                          Exeunt




                            SCENE 3.

                                        [They shake their heads]
    Cannot my body nor blood sacrifice
    Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
    Then take my soul-my body, soul, and all,
    Before that England give the French the foil.
            Exit  

          Excursions.
 The French fly

  YORK.
 Damsel of France, I think I have you fast.

    A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
    See how the ugly witch doth bend her brows
    As if, with Circe, she would change my shape!
  PUCELLE.
 I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.
 Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.
 Enter SUFFOLK, with MARGARET in his hand

  SUFFOLK.

    Be not offended, nature's miracle,
    Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me.

    I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.

    Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;
    Hast not a tongue? Is she not here thy prisoner?
    Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
    Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such
    Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  [Aside]  How canst thou tell she will deny thy
    suit,
    Before thou make a trial of her love?
  MARGARET.
  [Aside]  There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling
    card.
 And yet I would that you would answer me.
 It is some carpenter.

  SUFFOLK.
  [Aside]  Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
    And peace established between these realms.

    Henry is youthful, and will quickly yield.

  MARGARET.
 Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.

  MARGARET.
 And so shall you,
    If happy England's royal king be free.

  SUFFOLK.
 No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
    To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
    And have no portion in the choice myself.
 Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
  SUFFOLK.

  SUFFOLK.

    What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?
  REIGNIER.
 And I again, in Henry's royal name,
    As deputy unto that gracious king,  
    Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.

    So, farewell, Reignier.

  REIGNIER.

  MARGARET.
 Farewell, my lord.

  SUFFOLK.
 That for thyself, I will not so presume
    To send such peevish tokens to a king.


                  Camp of the DUKE OF YORK in Anjou

                   Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others
  YORK.


              Enter LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a SHEPHERD

  SHEPHERD.
 Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
    Have I sought every country far and near,
    And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
    Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
    Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
  PUCELLE.

  SHEPHERD.

    Her mother liveth yet, can testify
    She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.

  WARWICK.
 Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man
    Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.

  SHEPHERD.
             Exit
  YORK.

  PUCELLE.
 Ay, ay.
 Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!
  WARWICK.
 O, give me leave, I have deluded you.

  YORK.
 It's sign she hath been liberal and free.

    Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.

    Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
 Then lead me hence-with whom I leave my
    curse:
    May never glorious sun reflex his beams
    Upon the country where you make abode;
    But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
    Environ you, till mischief and despair
    Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
                                                   Exit, guarded
  YORK.
 Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence
    With letters of commission from the King.
 If we conclude a peace,
    It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
    As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.

  ALENCON.
 It shall;
    Only reserv'd, you claim no interest
    In any of our towns of garrison.
                 Exeunt




                              SCENE 5.

  SUFFOLK.
 Tush, my good lord! This superficial tale
    Is but a preface of her worthy praise.

    The chief perfections of that lovely dame,
    Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
    Would make a volume of enticing lines,
    Able to ravish any dull conceit;  
    And, which is more, she is not so divine,
    So full-replete with choice of all delights,
    But with as humble lowliness of mind
    She is content to be at your command
    Command, I mean, of virtuous intents,
    To love and honour Henry as her lord.
 And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.

    Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
    That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.

  KING HENRY.

    For your expenses and sufficient charge,
    Among the people gather up a tenth.

    And so conduct me where, from company,
    I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
                    Exit
  GLOUCESTER.

    Margaret shall now be Queen, and rule the King;
    But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.

SCENE:
England


ACT I.
 The palace

Flourish of trumpets; then hautboys.
 O Lord, that lends me life,
    Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
    For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
    A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
    If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
 Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
    Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
    Makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys,  
    Such is the fulness of my heart's content.

  ALL.

      Item: That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be
    released and delivered to the King her father'-
                                           [Lets the paper fall]
  KING HENRY.
 Pardon me, gracious lord;
    Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart,  
    And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
 Lord Marquess, kneel down.

                                 Exeunt KING, QUEEN, and SUFFOLK
  GLOUCESTER.

    What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
    His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?
    Did he so often lodge in open field,
    In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
    To conquer France, his true inheritance?
    And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
    To keep by policy what Henry got?
    Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
    Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
    Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?
    Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
    With all the learned Council of the realm,
    Studied so long, sat in the Council House
    Early and late, debating to and fro
    How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe?
    And had his Highness in his infancy
    Crowned in Paris, in despite of foes?
    And shall these labours and these honours die?  
    Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
    Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?
    O peers of England, shameful is this league!
    Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
    Blotting your names from books of memory,
    Razing the characters of your renown,
    Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
    Undoing all, as all had never been!
  CARDINAL.
 Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;
    But now it is impossible we should.
 Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
    These counties were the keys of Normandy!
    But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?  
  WARWICK.
 For grief that they are past recovery;
    For were there hope to conquer them again
    My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
    I see thy fury; if I longer stay
    We shall begin our ancient bickerings.

    Consider, lords, he is the next of blood
    And heir apparent to the English crown.

    Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal-
    More like a soldier than a man o' th' church,
    As stout and proud as he were lord of all-
    Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
    Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.

  SALISBURY.
 Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost-
    That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
    And would have kept so long as breath did last.

    Suffolk concluded on the articles;
    The peers agreed; and Henry was well pleas'd
    To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
       Exit




SCENE II.
 What dream'd my lord? Tell me, and I'll requite it
    With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.

  GLOUCESTER.
 My Lord Protector, 'tis his Highness' pleasure
    You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,
    Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.
 Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.

  HUME.
 Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good
    man, Jesu bless him!

                       Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN

  FIRST PETITIONER.
 I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my Lord
    Protector.
 Mine is, an't please your Grace, against John
    Goodman, my Lord Cardinal's man, for keeping my house and lands,
    and wife and all, from me.
 Thy wife too! That's some wrong indeed.

  PETER.
 [Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner,
    for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.
 My master said that he
    was, and that the King was an usurper.
 And he of these that can do most of all
    Cannot do more in England than the Nevils;
    Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.

  QUEEN.
 Not all these lords do vex me half so much
    As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife.

    She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
    And in her heart she scorns our poverty;
    Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her?
    Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,
    She vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day
    The very train of her worst wearing gown
    Was better worth than all my father's lands,
    Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.

  SUFFOLK.
 Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
    And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
    That she will light to listen to the lays,
    And never mount to trouble you again.


          Sound a sennet.
 If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
    Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
 Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
 The Cardinal's not my better in the field.

  BUCKINGHAM.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Madam, the King is old enough himself
    To give his censure.

  QUEEN.
 The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
    Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
 Thy cruelty in execution
    Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
    And left thee to the mercy of the law.
 Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
    If they were known, as the suspect is great,
    Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
 What, minion, can ye not?
                        [She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear]
    I cry your mercy, madam; was it you?
  DUCHESS.
 Was't I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
 Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.

  SUFFOLK.
 God is my witness, I am falsely accus'd by the
    villain.

  YORK.
 I humbly thank your royal Majesty.
   Flourish.
 Exeunt




SCENE IV.
 The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S garden

Enter MARGERY JOURDAIN, the witch; the two priests, HUME and SOUTHWELL;
and BOLINGBROKE

  HUME.
 [Exit HUME] Mother Jourdain, be you
    prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell, read you; and
    let us to our work.
 To this gear, the
    sooner the better.

    Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
    We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
 Asmath,
    By the eternal God, whose name and power
    Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
    For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence.

             [As the SPIRIT speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]
  BOLINGBROKE.
 'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
  SPIRIT.
 Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
 Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
    Injurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause.

    We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
 Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch'd her well.
'
    Why, this is just
    'Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse.
'  
    Well, to the rest:
    'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
    'By water shall he die and take his end.

  GLOUCESTER.
 My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
    That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
 And thy ambition, Gloucester.
  
  CARDINAL.
 [Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would 'twere
    come to that!
  CARDINAL.
 [Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious numbers for the
      matter;
    In thine own person answer thy abuse.
 Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
    Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
    We had had more sport.
 True, uncle.
 [Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.

  KING HENRY.
 Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
    Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.

  WIFE.
 His wife, an't like your worship.
 Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better
    told.
 Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.

  QUEEN.
 Ay, God Almighty help me!
  SUFFOLK.

  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.
 But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.
 What's his name?
  SIMPCOX.

  GLOUCESTER.
 What's thine own name?
  SIMPCOX.

  GLOUCESTER.
 If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well
    have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we
    do wear.
 O master, that you could!
  GLOUCESTER.
 [A stool
    brought] Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping,
    leap me over this stool and run away.


                         Enter a BEADLE with whips

  GLOUCESTER.
 Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet
    quickly.
 Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
 Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
  GLOUCESTER.

  CARDINAL.

  GLOUCESTER.
 What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM.

  CARDINAL.

  GLOUCESTER.
 O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
    Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
  QUEEN.
  
  GLOUCESTER.

    Sorry I am to hear what I have heard.

                                                Flourish.

  SALISBURY.

    By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
    To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
    Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
    Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;
    So, if the issue of the elder son
    Succeed before the younger, I am King.

  WARWICK.

    Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign.

  BOTH.
 Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!
  YORK.

    Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
    Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
    At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
    At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,
    Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
    That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;
    'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
    Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
  
  SALISBURY.
             Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
    In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;
    Receive the sentence of the law for sins
    Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.

    This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
    Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
 Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
    Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
 Please it your Majesty,
    This is the day appointed for the combat;
    And ready are the appellant and defendant,
    The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,
    So please your Highness to behold the fight.

  QUEEN.
 Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore  
    Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.

  KING HENRY.
 Peter, forsooth.

  SALISBURY.

    Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
                 [Alarum.
 They fight and PETER strikes him down]
  HORNER.
 Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
    For by his death we do perceive his guilt;
    And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
    The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
    Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
 Ten, my lord.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
    To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
  

          Enter the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER in a white sheet,
            and a taper burning in her hand, with SIR JOHN
               STANLEY, the SHERIFF, and OFFICERS

  SERVING-MAN.

  DUCHESS.
 Look how they gaze!
    See how the giddy multitude do point
    And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee;
    Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
    And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame
    And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
  GLOUCESTER.

    The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
    And when I start, the envious people laugh
    And bid me be advised how I tread.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Well, I will be there.
 Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
    You use her well; the world may laugh again,
    And I may live to do you kindness if
    You do it her.

  DUCHESS.
 That's bad enough, for I am but reproach-
    And shall I then be us'd reproachfully?
  STANLEY.
 Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharg'd.

  DUCHESS.
  
    No, it will hang upon my richest robes
    And show itself, attire me how I can.
            Exeunt

    Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
    Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
    And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.

    No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man  
    Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.

  CARDINAL.
 Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown
    Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.

  KING HENRY.
  
    Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,
    For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.


                          Enter SOMERSET

  SOMERSET.
 Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done!
  YORK.

    Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
    And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
    But I will remedy this gear ere long,
    Or sell my title for a glorious grave.

  SUFFOLK.
 Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
    Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.

    So help me God, as I have watch'd the night-  
    Ay, night by night- in studying good for England!
    That doit that e'er I wrested from the King,
    Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
    Be brought against me at my trial-day!
    No; many a pound of mine own proper store,
    Because I would not tax the needy commons,
    Have I dispursed to the garrisons,
    And never ask'd for restitution.

  CARDINAL.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Why, 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector
    Pity was all the fault that was in me;
    For I should melt at an offender's tears,
    And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
 Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous!
    Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition,
    And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;
    Foul subornation is predominant,
    And equity exil'd your Highness' land.
'
  CARDINAL.

    If those that care to keep your royal person
    From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage
    Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,
    And the offender granted scope of speech,
    'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.

  SUFFOLK.
 But I can give the loser leave to chide.

  GLOUCESTER.
        Exit, guarded
  KING HENRY.

  QUEEN.

    'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
 'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.

    But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
    Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:
    Were't not all one an empty eagle were set
    To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
    As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector?  
  QUEEN.

  SUFFOLK.
 Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then
    To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
    Who being accus'd a crafty murderer,
    His guilt should be but idly posted over,
    Because his purpose is not executed.

  QUEEN.

  CARDINAL.

  YORK.
 And now we three have spoke it,
    It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
 That Somerset be sent as Regent thither;
    'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
    Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
 No, not to lose it all as thou hast done.

    Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
    Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win.

    Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
    And temper clay with blood of Englishmen;
    To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
    Collected choicely, from each county some,
    And try your hap against the Irishmen?
  YORK.

  SUFFOLK.

  CARDINAL.
 I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
 Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts
    And change misdoubt to resolution;
    Be that thou hop'st to be; or what thou art
    Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying.

    Faster than spring-time show'rs comes thought on thought,
    And not a thought but thinks on dignity.

    This devil here shall be my substitute;
    For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
    In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.

  SECOND MURDERER.

    Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
    According as I gave directions?
  FIRST MURDERER.
 Enter the KING, the QUEEN,
                CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with attendants

  KING HENRY.

  SUFFOLK.
 God forbid any malice should prevail
    That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
    Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
  KING HENRY.


                           Re-enter SUFFOLK
  
    How now! Why look'st thou pale? Why tremblest thou?
    Where is our uncle? What's the matter, Suffolk?
  SUFFOLK.

  QUEEN.
 God's secret judgment! I did dream to-night
    The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
 Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
 How fares my gracious lord?
  SUFFOLK.

    Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
    Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
    Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.

    This get I by his death.
 The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
 Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY,
                          and many commons  

  WARWICK.
 It is reported, mighty sovereign,
    That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red
    By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.

  KING HENRY.
 That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
    But how he died God knows, not Henry.
 That shall I do, my liege.

  KING HENRY.
 That is to see how deep my grave is made;
    For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
    For, seeing him, I see my life in death.
 As surely as my soul intends to live
    With that dread King that took our state upon Him
    To free us from his Father's wrathful curse,
    I do believe that violent hands were laid  
    Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke.
 See how the blood is settled in his face.
 Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?
    Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
    And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
 But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes;
    And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
 What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
  QUEEN.
 He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,
    Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
    Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.

  WARWICK.
  
  WARWICK.
 But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,
    And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
    Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
    And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
    I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy knee
    Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
    And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st,
    That thou thyself was born in bastardy;
    And, after all this fearful homage done,
    Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,
    Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men.
 Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.


                        Re-enter SALISBURY

  SALISBURY.

    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
    They say in him they fear your Highness' death;
    And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
    Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
    As being thought to contradict your liking,
    Makes them thus forward in his banishment.

    But all the honour Salisbury hath won
    Is that he was the lord ambassador
    Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King.
 Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
    No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him,
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.

    Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
    But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
 Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
    Heart's discontent and sour affliction
    Be playfellows to keep you company!
    There's two of you; the devil make a third,
    And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!  
  SUFFOLK.
 A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?
    Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan,
    I would invent as bitter searching terms,
    As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,
    Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
    With full as many signs of deadly hate,
    As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave.

  SUFFOLK.

  QUEEN.

    O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd
    Embrace, and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,
    Loather a hundred times to part than die.

    Yet now, farewell; and farewell life with thee!
  SUFFOLK.
 Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
    Once by the King and three times thrice by thee,
    'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
    A wilderness is populous enough,
    So Suffolk had thy heavenly company;
    For where thou art, there is the world itself,
    With every several pleasure in the world;
    And where thou art not, desolation.

  QUEEN.

    To die by thee were but to die in jest:
    From thee to die were torture more than death.

    To France, sweet Suffolk.
 I go.

  QUEEN.

London.

  KING HENRY.
 Ah, what a sign it is of evil life
    Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
  WARWICK.
 Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.

    He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.

    Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;
    And let us all to meditation.

  Fight at sea.
 The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
    Is crept into the bosom of the sea;
    And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
    That drag the tragic melancholy night;
    Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings
    Clip dead men's graves, and from their misty jaws
    Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
 A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
 I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
 And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.

    A cunning man did calculate my birth  
    And told me that by water I should die;
    Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
    Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded.

  SUFFOLK.
 Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  LIEUTENANT.

  LIEUTENANT.
 Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side
    Strike off his head.
 Poole!
  SUFFOLK.

    Thy lips, that kiss'd the Queen, shall sweep the ground;
    And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
    Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
    Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again;
    And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
    For daring to affy a mighty lord
    Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
    Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
 Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.

    Far be it we should honour such as these
    With humble suit: no, rather let my head
    Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
    Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
    And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
    Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.

  SUFFOLK.
 And as for these, whose ransom we have set,
    It is our pleasure one of them depart;
    Therefore come you with us, and let him go.

    If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
    So will the Queen, that living held him dear.
  
                                              Exit with the body

Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND

  GEORGE.

  JOHN.
 I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the
    commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.

  JOHN.

  GEORGE.

  JOHN.
 For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with the
    spirit of putting down kings and princes- command silence.
 My father was a Mortimer-
  DICK.
 [Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.
 My mother a Plantagenet-  
  DICK.
 My wife descended of the Lacies-
  DICK.

  SMITH.

  SMITH.
 [Aside] He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of
    proof.
 All the realm shall be
    in common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass.
 Is not this a lamentable thing, that
    of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That
    parchment, being scribbl'd o'er, should undo a man? Some say the
    bee stings; but I say 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal once
    to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.
 Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
 They use to write it on the top of letters; 'twill go hard
    with you.

  MICHAEL.

  CADE.
 No.

    [Kneels] Rise up, Sir John Mortimer.
 [Rises] Now have at him!

                Enter SIR HUMPHREY STAFFORD and WILLIAM
                  his brother, with drum and soldiers
  
  STAFFORD.

  WILLIAM STAFFORD.
 But angry, wrathful, and inclin'd to blood,
    If you go forward; therefore yield or die.

  CADE.
 As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not;
    It is to you, good people, that I speak,
    O'er whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;
    For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
 By her he had two children at one birth.

  CADE.
 Ay, there's the question; but I say 'tis true.

  WILLIAM STAFFORD.
 Fellow kings, I  
    tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth and made
    it an eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French, and
    therefore he is a traitor.

  STAFFORD.
 Nay, answer if you can; the Frenchmen are our enemies.

  WILLIAM STAFFORD.
 Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
    Assail them with the army of the King.

    We will not leave one lord, one gentleman;  
    Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,
    For they are thrifty honest men and such
    As would- but that they dare not- take our parts.

  DICK.

  CADE.

Enter CADE and the rest

  CADE.
 Here, sir.
 [Putting on SIR
    HUMPHREY'S brigandine] This monument of the victory will I bear,
    and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse heels till I do come
    to London, where we will have the mayor's sword borne before us.

  DICK.
 Fear not that, I warrant thee.

London.
 Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind
    And makes it fearful and degenerate;
    Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
 What answer makes your Grace to the rebels'
    supplication?
  KING HENRY.

  KING HENRY.
 How now, madam!
    Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
    I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
    Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.

  QUEEN.
  
    The citizens fly and forsake their houses;
    The rascal people, thirsting after prey,
    Join with the traitor; and they jointly swear
    To spoil the city and your royal court.

  KING HENRY.
 [To LORD SAY] Farewell, my lord, trust not the Kentish
    rebels.
 The trust I have is in mine innocence,
    And therefore am I bold and resolute.


                    Enter a SOLDIER, running

  SOLDIER.
 If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack Cade more;
    I think he hath a very fair warning.

  DICK.
 My lord, there's an army gathered together in Smithfield.

  CADE.
 Come then, let's go fight with them.
 MATTHEW GOFFE is slain, and all the rest.
 Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.

  SMITH.
 I have thought upon it; it shall be so.
 My mouth shall be the Parliament of
    England.
 My lord, a prize, a prize! Here's the Lord Say, which
    sold the towns in France; he that made us pay one and twenty
    fifteens, and one shining to the pound, the last subsidy.


                Enter GEORGE BEVIS, with the LORD SAY

  CADE.
 Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.
 Thou hast most
    traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
    grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other
    books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to
    be us'd, and, contrary to the King, his crown, and dignity, thou
    hast built a paper-mill.

    Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before
    them about matters they were not able to answer.
 Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
  
  GEORGE.

  SAY.

  CADE.

  SAY.
- Away with him! He has a familiar under his tongue; he
    speaks not o' God's name.

  ALL.

  CADE.
  [Exeunt some with
    LORD SAY]  The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head
    on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute; there shall not a
    maid be married, but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they
    have it.

  DICK.
 Marry, presently.

  ALL.

    Soldiers, defer the spoil of the city until night; for with these
    borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the
    streets, and at every corner have them kiss.
 Away!     Exeunt




SCENE VIII.

    Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the King
    Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
    And here pronounce free pardon to them all
    That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
 What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave?
    And you, base peasants, do ye believe him? Will you needs be
    hang'd with your about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broke
    through London gates, that you should leave me at the White Hart
    in Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out these arms
    till you had recovered your ancient freedom.

  CADE.
 I see them lay their  
    heads together to surprise me.

                                             Exeunt some of them
    Follow me, soldiers; we'll devise a mean
    To reconcile you all unto the King.
                   Exeunt




SCENE IX.
 Enter KING, QUEEN, and SOMERSET, on the terrace

  KING HENRY.
 Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris'd?
    Or is he but retir'd to make him strong?

     Enter, below, multitudes, with halters about their necks

  CLIFFORD.
 My lord,
    I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
    Or unto death, to do my country good.

                                                Flourish.

Kent.

  CADE.

    Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine;
    See if thou canst outface me with thy looks;
    Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
    Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
    Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
    My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,
    And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
    Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.

  CADE.
 [Here they  
    fight; CADE falls] O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain
    me.
 Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
    Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed
    And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead.

    Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
    But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat
    To emblaze the honour that thy master got.

Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours

  YORK.
 From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
    And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
    Ring bells aloud, burn bonfires clear and bright,
    To entertain great England's lawful king.
 Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
-
    Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me
    That I have given no answer all this while;
    My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.

  YORK.
 Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
  BUCKINGHAM.

  YORK.
 In all submission and humility
    York doth present himself unto your Highness.
 To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
    And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
    Who since I heard to be discomfited.


                    Enter IDEN, with CADE's head

  IDEN.

    Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
    False king, why hast thou broken faith with me,
    Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
    King did I call thee? No, thou art not king;
    Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
    Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
 O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
    Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown.

    Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail:        Exit attendant
    I know, ere thy will have me go to ward,
    They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.

  QUEEN.
 Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,
    To say if that the bastard boys of York
    Shall be the surety for their traitor father.


                     Enter CLIFFORD and his SON

  QUEEN.
 And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.

    We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;
    For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.
 Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
    Makes him oppose himself against his king.

  CLIFFORD.
 And if words will not, then our weapons shall.

  RICHARD.
 Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
    Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
    Who, being suffer'd, with the bear's fell paw,
    Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried;  
    And such a piece of service will you do,
    If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
 Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
    As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
  YORK.

  CLIFFORD.
 Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.

  KING HENRY.
 It is great sin to swear unto a sin;
    But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.

  WARWICK.

  CLIFFORD.

  YOUNG CLIFFORD.

  RICHARD.
 Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
 If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.

  CLIFFORD.
 Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
    But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
 Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.

    Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!         Exit  

                     Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD

  YOUNG CLIFFORD.

    Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.

                                              Exit with the body  

       Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight.
 Enter KING, QUEEN, and others

    Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;
    'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
    Being opposites of such repairing nature.

 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.

  WESTMORELAND.

  CLIFFORD.

  KING HENRY.
 Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
 The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
    When I was crown'd, I was but nine months old.
 You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.

  MONTAGUE.
 Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
    Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.

  YORK.
 Plantagenet shall speak first.
 [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.
 Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
    Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd.
 O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK.
 Richard Plantagenet,
    Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
 What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND.
 I cannot stay to hear these articles.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
 Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK.

    But be it as it may.
 [To YORK] I here entail
    The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
    Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
    To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
    To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
    And neither by treason nor hostility
    To seek to put me down and reign thyself.

  WARWICK.

  EXETER.
 And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
 Who can be patient in such extremes?
    Ah, wretched man! Would I had died a maid,
    And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
    Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father!
    Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus?
    Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,
    Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
    Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
    Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
    Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,
    And disinherited thine only son.
 Ah, timorous wretch!
    Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me;
    And giv'n unto the house of York such head  
    As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.

    The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
    Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
    And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace  
    And utter ruin of the house of York.
 Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
 When I return with victory from the field
    I'll see your Grace; till then I'll follow her.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
        Exeunt




SCENE II.
 No, I can better play the orator.

  MONTAGUE.
 Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
 No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.

    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
 Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
    You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
    The army of the Queen mean to besiege us.

  SIR JOHN.
 What, with five thousand men?
  RICHARD.
 Enter RUTLAND and his TUTOR

  RUTLAND.
 And I, my lord, will bear him company.

  RUTLAND.

  CLIFFORD.

  CLIFFORD.
 I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
  CLIFFORD.
 Enter the DUKE OF YORK

  YORK.
 The army of the Queen hath got the field.

    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.


         Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,
               the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers

    Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
    I dare your quenchless fury to more rage;
    I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
  
    Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
    And made an evening at the noontide prick.

    Why come you not? What! multitudes, and fear?
  CLIFFORD.
 I will not bandy with thee word for word,
    But buckler with thee blows, twice two for one.
 Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
 So doth the cony struggle in the net.
 So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
    So true men yield, with robbers so o'er-match'd.
 Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
    Come, make him stand upon this molehill here
    That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
    Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
 Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
  
  YORK.
 She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
    Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
    How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
    To triumph like an Amazonian trull
    Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
    But that thy face is visard-like, unchanging,
    Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
    I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.

    O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide!
    How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
    To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
    And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
    Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible:
    Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
    I should not for my life but weep with him,  
    To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
 Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.

    Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
    As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
    Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
    Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
    The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.
 Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
    Not separated with the racking clouds,
    But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.

    See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
    As if they vow'd some league inviolable.

    Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.

    Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
    Upon my target three fair shining suns.


                 Enter a MESSENGER, blowing

    But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
    Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
  MESSENGER.

  RICHARD.
 Environed he was with many foes,
    And stood against them as the hope of Troy
    Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy.

    By many hands your father was subdu'd;
    But only slaught'red by the ireful arm
    Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,
    Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite,
    Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
    The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks
    A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
    Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain;
    And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
    They took his head, and on the gates of York
    They set the same; and there it doth remain,
    The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
  
    Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
    Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
    For never henceforth shall I joy again;
    Never, O never, shall I see more joy.
 His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
    His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
 Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
    Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
    Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told,
    The words would add more anguish than the wounds.

    After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
    Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp,
    Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
    Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
 Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
    And when came George from Burgundy to England?
  WARWICK.

  RICHARD.

    'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
 Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
    And therefore comes my brother Montague.
 The proud insulting Queen,
    With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
    And of their feather many moe proud birds,
    Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.

    Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.
 Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
    And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!-
    Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.
  
  WARWICK.

  RICHARD.
  
  WARWICK.

Before York

Flourish.
 Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
    To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
 My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
    And this soft courage makes your followers faint.

    You promis'd knighthood to our forward son:
    Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.

  PRINCE OF WALES.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  PRINCE OF WALES.
 Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
    Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.

  RICHARD.
 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
 No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  
  RICHARD.

  KING HENRY.

  CLIFFORD.

  RICHARD.

    By Him that made us all, I am resolv'd
    That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

  EDWARD.
  
  WARWICK.
 If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
    For York in justice puts his armour on.

  PRINCE OF WALES.

  RICHARD.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    His father revell'd in the heart of France,
    And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;
    And had he match'd according to his state,
    He might have kept that glory to this day;
    But when he took a beggar to his bed
    And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,
    Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him
    That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France
    And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
 But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
    And that thy summer bred us no increase,
    We set the axe to thy usurping root;
    And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
    Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
    We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,  
    Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.

A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire

Alarum; excursions.
 Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
    For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
 What hap? What hope of good?

                         Enter GEORGE

  GEORGE.
 Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
    Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
    Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
    And in the very pangs of death he cried,
    Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,
    'Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death.
 Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.

    I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.

    I that did never weep now melt with woe
    That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
 Yet let us all together to our troops,
    And give them leave to fly that will not stay,
    And call them pillars that will stand to us;
    And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
    As victors wear at the Olympian games.

    Forslow no longer; make we hence amain.

    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]

                 Enter WARWICK; CLIFFORD flies

  RICHARD.

Another part of the field

Alarum.
 This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.

    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.

    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.


       Alarum.

    This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
    May be possessed with some store of crowns;
    And I, that haply take them from him now,
    May yet ere night yield both my life and them
    To some man else, as this dead man doth me.

    O heavy times, begetting such events!
    From London by the King was I press'd forth;
    My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
    Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
    And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life,
    Have by my hands of life bereaved him.

    My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
    And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
 O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
    Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
    Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
 Is this our foeman's face?
    Ah, no, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
    Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
    Throw up thine eye! See, see what show'rs arise,
    Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
    Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!
    O, pity, God, this miserable age!
    What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,  
    Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural,
    This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
    O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
    And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
  KING HENRY.
 How will my wife for slaughter of my son
    Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied!
  KING HENRY.
 Was ever son so rued a father's death?  
  FATHER.
 I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
 Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
    And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.
 Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
 Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
 Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD
               MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and soldiers

  EDWARD.

    But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
  WARWICK.

                                     [CLIFFORD groans, and dies]
  RICHARD.
 Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
    A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

  EDWARD.
 From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
    Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
    Instead whereof let this supply the room.

  RICHARD.

  GEORGE.

  EDWARD.

  RICHARD.
 What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
    When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.

  RICHARD.

  WARWICK.

ACT III.
 SCENE I.
 Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
    For wise men say it is the wisest course.

    She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry:
    He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.

    She weeps, and says her Henry is depos'd:
    He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
    That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
    Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
    Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
    And in conclusion wins the King from her
    With promise of his sister, and what else,
    To strengthen and support King Edward's place.

  KING HENRY.
 My crown is call'd content;
    A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

  KING HENRY.

    Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;
    And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.
  PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANY
SERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.

    Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
    Which we in justice cannot well deny,
    Because in quarrel of the house of York
    The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
 Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
    It were dishonour to deny it her.

  KING EDWARD.

    May it please your Highness to resolve me now;
    And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.

  GLOUCESTER.

  CLARENCE.

  KING EDWARD.

  CLARENCE.
 [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
 Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
 Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.

                              [GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE withdraw]
  KING EDWARD.
 Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY GREY.

  KING EDWARD.
 What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY GREY.

  KING EDWARD.
 Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
 That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.

  KING EDWARD.

  LADY GREY.
 The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.

  LADY GREY.
 My mind will never grant what I perceive
    Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.
 To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
 Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
 Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
    No, if thou dost say no to my demand.

  KING EDWARD.

  KING EDWARD.

  KING EDWARD.

  CLARENCE.
 To who, my lord?
  KING EDWARD.

  GLOUCESTER.
 By so much is the wonder in extremes.

  KING EDWARD.
 See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.

    And go we, brothers, to the man that took him
    To question of his apprehension.
 Lords, use her honourably.

    And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?
    O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought!  
    Then, since this earth affords no joy to me
    But to command, to check, to o'erbear such
    As are of better person than myself,
    I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
    And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,
    Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head
    Be round impaled with a glorious crown.

    I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
    I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
    I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
    Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
    And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
           Exit




SCENE III.
  LEWIS sits, and riseth up again

  LEWIS.
 It ill befits thy state
    And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

    Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
    It shall be eas'd, if France can yield relief.

    Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;  
    Our people and our peers are both misled,
    Our treasure seiz'd, our soldiers put to flight,
    And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
    For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
    I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
    Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
    To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
    Where fame, late ent'ring at his heedful ears,
    Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
 Injurious Margaret!
  PRINCE OF WALES.
 And why not Queen?
  WARWICK.
 Because thy father Henry did usurp;
    And thou no more art prince than she is queen.

    From these our Henry lineally descends.

  WARWICK.

  OXFORD.

  WARWICK.
 Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,  
    Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
    While I use further conference with Warwick.

  LEWIS.
 Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry's friend.

    Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
    That your estate requires and mine can yield.
 Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
    Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    These from our King unto your Majesty.

  PRINCE OF WALES.
 Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.

  WARWICK.

    I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
    And replant Henry in his former state.

  WARWICK.
 So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,  
    That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
    With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
    I'll undertake to land them on our coast
    And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
 Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
    But by thy help to this distressed queen?
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
    Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
  BONA.
 Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
 Then, England's messenger, return in post  
    And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
    That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
    To revel it with him and his new bride.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 But, Warwick,
    Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
    Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle:
    And, as occasion serves, this noble Queen
    And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
 Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.

    Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
    Therefore delay not- give thy hand to Warwick;
    And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
    That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

  PRINCE OF WALES.
 Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
    And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

                                  [He gives his hand to WARWICK]
  LEWIS.

    I long till Edward fall by war's mischance
    For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
                   Exit

  CLARENCE.
 Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
    That you stand pensive as half malcontent?
  CLARENCE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Not I.
 But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.

  HASTINGS.
 'Tis better using France than trusting France.

    Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas
    Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable,
    And with their helps only defend ourselves.
 For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
    To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

  KING EDWARD.
 Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
    And for this once my will shall stand for law.
 Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
    That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  KING EDWARD.
 These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
    'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
    I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.

    But what said Warwick to these injuries?
  MESSENGER.
'
  KING EDWARD.

                                      Exit, and SOMERSET follows
  GLOUCESTER.
 [Aside] Not I.

    My thoughts aim at a further matter; I
    Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.

    Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
    Go levy men and make prepare for war;
    They are already, or quickly will be landed.

                                    Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
    But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
    Resolve my doubt.

  MONTAGUE.
 So God help Montague as he proves true!
  HASTINGS.
 Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
  
    Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour
    Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r.

    Speak suddenly, my lords- are we all friends?
  CLARENCE.

  WARWICK.
 Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
    The King by this is set him down to sleep.

  SECOND WATCHMAN.
 O, is it So? But why commands the King
    That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
    While he himself keeps in the cold field?
  SECOND WATCHMAN.
 GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage

  SOMERSET.

    Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
    My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.

    My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
    See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
    Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
 These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
    Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
    Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.

  RIVERS.
 But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 I am inform'd that he comes towards London
    To set the crown once more on Henry's head.

    Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down.

    There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.


             Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him
  
  HUNTSMAN.
 To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.

  KING EDWARD.
 Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
    And pray that I may repossess the crown.

  KING HENRY.

    Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
    By living low where fortune cannot hurt me,
    And that the people of this blessed land
    May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
    Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
    I here resign my government to thee,
    For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

  WARWICK.

    Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
    That no dissension hinder government.

    And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
    Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor,
    And all his lands and goods confiscated.

  KING HENRY.

  CLARENCE.


                          Enter a POST

  WARWICK.

  WARWICK.

                   Exeunt all but SOMERSET, RICHMOND, and OXFORD
  SOMERSET.

    As Henry's late presaging prophecy
    Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
    So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts,
    What may befall him to his harm and ours.
 Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
    'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

    Come therefore, let's about it speedily.
 Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
    Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
    And says that once more I shall interchange
    My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
 Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
    As being well content with that alone.

  GLOUCESTER.

  MAYOR.
 Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
    Our trusty friend, unless I be deceiv'd.

  KING EDWARD.

    Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
  GLOUCESTER.
 Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.

  HASTINGS.

    Now for this night let's harbour here in York;
    And when the morning sun shall raise his car
    Above the border of this horizon,
    We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;  
    For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
 What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
    With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
    Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas
    And with his troops doth march amain to London;
    And many giddy people flock to him.
 Let's levy men and beat him back again.

  KING HENRY.
 Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  MONTAGUE.

                      [Shout within 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!']
  EXETER.
 Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
    And once again proclaim us King of England.


                   Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE

  WARWICK.
 At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
    And do expect him here some two hours hence.
 It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.

  WARWICK.
 They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.


        March.
 Flourish.

  WARWICK.
 O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
    Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd
    That we could hear no news of his repair?
  KING EDWARD.

  WARWICK.
 Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
 O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

  
             Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours

  WARWICK.
 Come, Clarence, come.
 Thou wilt if Warwick call.

    I will not ruinate my father's house,
    Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
    And set up Lancaster.
 Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
    Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.
 Enter KING EDWARD, bringing forth WARWICK, wounded

  KING EDWARD.
 So, lie thou there.
 Die thou, and die our fear;
    For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
 Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.


                  Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET

  SOMERSET.

    The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power;
    Even now we heard the news.

    Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
 The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
    And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.

    If she have time to breathe, be well assur'd  
    Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
 are advertis'd by our loving friends
    That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury;
    We, having now the best at Barnet field,
    Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
    And as we march our strength will be augmented
    In every county as we go along.

    Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.

Plains wear Tewksbury

Flourish.
 March.
 Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their
      loss,
    But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.

    And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
    What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
    And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
    All these the enemies to our poor bark.
 Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

  PRINCE OF WALES.


                        Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER.
 I thought no less.

    Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
    Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
    His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
    His statutes cancell'd, and his treasure spent;
    And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
 Then, in God's name, lords,
    Be valiant, and give signal to the fight.

  SOMERSET.


                Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD
  
  KING EDWARD.

    Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
    Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
    Whilst I propose the self-same words to the
    Which, traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

  GLOUCESTER.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
 I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
 And there's for twitting me with perjury.
 Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.

    Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
    How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
    You have no children, butchers, if you had,
    The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse.
 Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
 Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.

    Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.

  CLARENCE.
 Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
  QUEEN MARGARET.

    'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.

  KING EDWARD.

  QUEEN MARGARET.

    'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'
  GLOUCESTER.

                                                 Exit LIEUTENANT
  KING HENRY.
 So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
    So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,
    And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.

    What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.

  KING HENRY.
 Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING HENRY.
 Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
 I'll hear no more.
 Die, prophet, in thy speech.
 Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.

    See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death.

    I have no brother, I am like no brother;
    And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
    Be resident in men like one another,
    And not in me! I am myself alone.

    What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
    Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!
    Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
    For hardy and undoubted champions;
    Two Cliffords, as the father and the son;
    And two Northumberlands- two braver men
    Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
    With them the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
    That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
    And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.

  KING EDWARD.


    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present.

 SCENE 1.


London.
 The palace

Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other,
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY

  BUCKINGHAM.
 How have ye done
    Since last we saw in France?
  NORFOLK.

  NORFOLK.
 To-day the French,
    All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
    Shone down the English; and to-morrow they
    Made Britain India: every man that stood
    Show'd like a mine.
 Now this masque
    Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night
    Made it a fool and beggar.
 All was royal:
    To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;
    Order gave each thing view.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 I do know
    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
    By this so sicken'd their estates that never  
    They shall abound as formerly.

  ABERGAVENNY.

  NORFOLK.
 Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.
 Here, so please you.
 Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
    shall lessen this big look.
 A beggar's book
    Outworths a noble's blood.

  NORFOLK.

  BUCKINGHAM.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Now this follows,
    Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
    To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,  
    Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt-
    For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
    To whisper Wolsey-here makes visitation-
    His fears were that the interview betwixt
    England and France might through their amity
    Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
    Peep'd harms that menac'd him-privily
    Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow-
    Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor
    Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted
    Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made,
    And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,
    That he would please to alter the King's course,
    And break the foresaid peace.

  SERGEANT.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Lo you, my lord,
    The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
    Under device and practice.

  BRANDON.

  BUCKINGHAM.

    I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
    Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
    By dark'ning my clear sun.

    Exeunt




ACT I.


London.
 The CARDINAL places himself
under the KING'S feet on his right side

  KING.
 Let be call'd before us
    That gentleman of Buckingham's.
 In person
    I'll hear his confessions justify;
    And point by point the treasons of his master
    He shall again relate.
 Half your suit
    Never name to us: you have half our power.

  KING.
 Lady mine, proceed.
 Taxation!
    Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,
    You that are blam'd for it alike with us,
    Know you of this taxation?
  WOLSEY.
 Please you, sir,
    I know but of a single part in aught  
    Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file
    Where others tell steps with me.
 These exactions,
    Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
    Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em
    The back is sacrifice to th' load.

  KING.
 And for me,
    I have no further gone in this than by
    A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
    By learned approbation of the judges.
 If we shall stand still,
    In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
    We should take root here where we sit, or sit
    State-statues only.

    We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
    And stick them in our will.

  WOLSEY.
 I shall anon advise you
    Further in the proceeding.
 This man so complete,
    Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
    Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find
    His hour of speech a minute-he, my lady,
    Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
    That once were his, and is become as black
    As if besmear'd in hell.
 Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
    Most like a careful subject, have collected  
    Out of the Duke of Buckingham.

  KING.
 These very words
    I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
    Lord Aberga'ny, to whom by oath he menac'd
    Revenge upon the Cardinal.
 Presently the Duke
    Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
    'Twould prove the verity of certain words
    Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he
    'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
    John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
    To hear from him a matter of some moment;  
    Whom after under the confession's seal
    He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
    My chaplain to no creature living but
    To me should utter, with demure confidence
    This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs,
    Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive
    To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke
    Shall govern England.
 If I know you well,
    You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office
    On the complaint o' th' tenants.

  SURVEYOR.

    I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions
    The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous
      for him  
    To ruminate on this so far, until
    It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,
    It was much like to do.

  KING.
 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-
    As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd
    The part my father meant to act upon  
    Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
    Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted,
    As he made semblance of his duty, would
    Have put his knife into him.
 God mend all!
  KING.


London.
 Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
    Men into such strange mysteries?
  SANDYS.
 One would take it,
    That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
    Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.
 What is't for?
  LOVELL.

  LOVELL.
 Ay, marry,
    There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
    Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.

  SANDYS.
 Now
    An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
    A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
    And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,
    Held current music too.
 O, 'tis true;
    This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
    To many lords and ladies; there will be
    The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 He may, my lord; has wherewithal.
 In him  
    Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
    Men of his way should be most liberal,
    They are set here for examples.


London.
 The Presence Chamber in York Place

Hautboys.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
  
  SANDYS.
 By your leave, sweet ladies.

                 [Seats himself between ANNE BULLEN and another lady]
    If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
    I had it from my father.
 Was he mad, sir?
  SANDYS.

    But he would bite none; just as I do now,
    He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
 That noble lady  
    Or gentleman that is not freely merry
    Is not my friend.
 Cheer your neighbours.
 Gentlemen,
    Whose fault is this?
  SANDYS.
 The red wine first must rise
    In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
    Talk us to silence.

  ANNE.

  SANDYS.
 You cannot show me.
 Th' have left their barge and landed,
    And hither make, as great ambassadors
    From foreign princes.

    A good digestion to you all; and once more
    I show'r a welcome on ye; welcome all.


      Hautboys.
 Pray tell 'em thus much from me:
    There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,
    More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
    If I but knew him, with my love and duty
    I would surrender it.
 Let me see, then.

    You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, Cardinal,
    I should judge now unhappily.

  WOLSEY.
 O, God save ye!
    Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become
    Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
 I'll save you
    That labour, sir.
 All's now done but the ceremony
    Of bringing back the prisoner.
 Were you there?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 I am sorry for't.
 The great Duke.

    The King's attorney, on the contrary,
    Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions,
    Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd
    To have brought, viva voce, to his face;
    At which appear'd against him his surveyor,
    Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,
    Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,
    Hopkins, that made this mischief.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 The same.
 'Tis likely,
    By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,
    Then deputy of Ireland, who remov'd,
    Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
    Lest he should help his father.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 To th' water side I must conduct your Grace;
    Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
    Who undertakes you to your end.

  BUCKINGHAM.

    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!  
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble.
 All good people,  
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
 Let me have it;
    I do not talk much.
 Did you not of late days hear
    A buzzing of a separation
    Between the King and Katharine?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Yes, but it held not;
    For when the King once heard it, out of anger
    He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
    To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
    That durst disperse it.
 I think you have hit the mark; but is't
        not cruel
    That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
    Will have his will, and she must fall.
 'Tis woeful.


London.
 They were
    young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north.
 Well, let him have them.

    He will have all, I think.
 It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
    Has crept too near his conscience.

  NORFOLK.

  SUFFOLK.

  NORFOLK.

    Health to your lordships!
  NORFOLK.
  [To WOLSEY]  My good lord, have great care
    I be not found a talker.

  WOLSEY.

    I would your Grace would give us but an hour
    Of private conference.
  [Aside to SUFFOLK]  This priest has no pride in him!
  SUFFOLK.
  [Aside to NORFOLK]  Not to speak of!
    I would not be so sick though for his place.

    But this cannot continue.
  [Aside to SUFFOLK]  If it do,
    I'll venture one have-at-him.

  KING.

    They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
 The Queen shall be acquainted
    Forthwith for what you come.
 God forbid else.
                   [Walks and whispers]
  CAMPEIUS.
 My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
    In this man's place before him?
  WOLSEY.
 Yes, he was.
 For living murmurers
    There's places of rebuke.
 O, my lord,  
    Would it not grieve an able man to leave
    So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!
    O, 'tis a tender place! and I must leave her.

  OLD LADY.
 Verily,
    I swear 'tis better to be lowly born
    And range with humble livers in content
    Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief
    And wear a golden sorrow.

  OLD LADY.

  ANNE.
 No, in truth.
 If your back
    Cannot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis too weak
    Ever to get a boy.

  ANNE.

    Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
 Now, I pray God, amen!
  CHAMBERLAIN.
 This is strange to me.
 Have you heard it?
  ANNE.

  OLD LADY.
 By this time
    I know your back will bear a duchess.
 Pray, do not deliver
    What here y' have heard to her.


London.
 The KING takes place under the cloth of state;
the two CARDINALS sit under him as judges.
 The QUEEN takes place
some distance from the KING.
 The BISHOPS place themselves on each side
of the court, in manner of consistory; below them the SCRIBES.
 Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
    Let silence be commanded.

  WOLSEY.
 Be't so; proceed.

  SCRIBE.
 Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,
    And to bestow your pity on me; for
    I am a most poor woman and a stranger,
    Born out of your dominions, having here
    No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
    Of equal friendship and proceeding.
 It is not to be question'd  
    That they had gather'd a wise council to them
    Of every realm, that did debate this business,
    Who deem'd our marriage lawful.
 Your pleasure, madam?
  QUEEN KATHARINE.
 Madam, you do me wrong:
    I have no spleen against you, nor injustice
    For you or any; how far I have proceeded,
    Or how far further shall, is warranted
    By a commission from the Consistory,
    Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome.
 You charge me
    That I have blown this coal: I do deny it.

    The King is present; if it be known to him
    That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
    And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much
    As you have done my truth.
 If he know
    That I am free of your report, he knows
    I am not of your wrong.

  QUEEN KATHARINE.

    You have, by fortune and his Highness' favours,
    Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted
    Where pow'rs are your retainers, and your words,
    Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
    Yourself pronounce their office.
 I must tell you
    You tender more your person's honour than
    Your high profession spiritual; that again
    I do refuse you for my judge and here,
    Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,
    To bring my whole cause 'fore his Holiness
    And to be judg'd by him.

  GENTLEMAN USHER.
 Pray you pass on.
           Exeunt QUEEN and her attendants
  KING.
 She's noble born;
    And like her true nobility she has
    Carried herself towards me.

  WOLSEY.
 My Lord Cardinal,
    I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
    I free you from't.
 By some of these
    The Queen is put in anger.
 This respite shook
    The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
    Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
    The region of my breast, which forc'd such way
    That many maz'd considerings did throng
    And press'd in with this caution.
 Hence I took a thought
    This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,
    Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not
    Be gladded in't by me.
 Thus hulling in
    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
    Now present here together; that's to say
    I meant to rectify my conscience, which
    I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,
    By all the reverend fathers of the land
    And doctors learn'd.

  KING.
 Unsolicited
    I left no reverend person in this court,
    But by particular consent proceeded
    Under your hands and seals; therefore, go on,
    For no dislike i' th' world against the person
    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points
    Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.
 -Break up the court;
    I say, set on.


London.


        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
 Peace to your Highness!
  QUEEN KATHARINE.
 May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
    Into your private chamber, we shall give you
    The full cause of our coming.
 Would all other women
    Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
    My lords, I care not-so much I am happy
    Above a number-if my actions
    Were tried by ev'ry tongue, ev'ry eye saw 'em,
    Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
    I know my life so even.
 Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenis-sima-
  QUEEN KATHARINE.

  QUEEN KATHARINE.
 Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears;
    Your hopes and friends are infinite.
 I would your Grace
    Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.
 'Twill be much
    Both for your honour better and your cause;
    For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye  
    You'll part away disgrac'd.

  CAMPEIUS.
 Pray hear me.

    What will become of me now, wretched lady?
    I am the most unhappy woman living.

  WOLSEY.
 If your Grace
    Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
    You'd feel more comfort.
 You wrong your virtues
    With these weak women's fears.
 The palace

Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK, the DUKE OF SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY,
and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN

  NORFOLK.

  SURREY.
 Most Strangely.
 Has the King this?
  SUFFOLK.

  SURREY.
 But in this point
    All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
    After his patient's death: the King already
    Hath married the fair lady.
 Now, all my joy
    Trace the conjunction!
  SUFFOLK.
 But, my lords,
    She is a gallant creature, and complete
    In mind and feature.
 But will the King
    Digest this letter of the Cardinal's?
    The Lord forbid!
  NORFOLK.
 Marry, amen!
  SUFFOLK.
 Cardinal Campeius
    Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;  
    Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled, and
    Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,
    To second all his plot.

  NORFOLK.

  WOLSEY.
  
  WOLSEY.

    Anne Bullen! No, I'll no Anne Bullens for him;
    There's more in't than fair visage.
 Bullen!
    No, we'll no Bullens.
 The Marchioness of Pembroke!
  NORFOLK.
 He's discontented.
 What though I know her virtuous
    And well deserving? Yet I know her for
    A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
    Our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of  
    Our hard-rul'd King.
 What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
    To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour
    Seems to flow from him! How, i' th' name of thrift,
    Does he rake this together?-Now, my lords,
    Saw you the Cardinal?
  NORFOLK.
 My lord, we have
    Stood here observing him.
 Some strange commotion
    Is in his brain: he bites his lip and starts,
    Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,  
    Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
    Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
    Strikes his breast hard; and anon he casts
    His eye against the moon.

  KING.
 This morning
    Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
    As I requir'd; and wot you what I found
    There-on my conscience, put unwittingly?
    Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing
    The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
    Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
    I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
    Possession of a subject.
 It's heaven's will;
    Some spirit put this paper in the packet
    To bless your eye withal.
 Good, my lord,
    You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
    Of your best graces in your mind; the which
    You were now running o'er.
 'Tis well said again;
    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
    And yet words are no deeds.
 Since I had my office
    I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
    Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
    But par'd my present havings to bestow
    My bounties upon you.
 Have I not made you
    The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me  
    If what I now pronounce you have found true;
    And, if you may confess it, say withal
    If you are bound to us or no.
 What say you?
  WOLSEY.
 My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
    Show'r'd on me daily, have been more than could
    My studied purposes requite; which went
    Beyond all man's endeavours.
 My endeavours,
    Have ever come too short of my desires,
    Yet fil'd with my abilities; mine own ends
    Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
    To th' good of your most sacred person and
    The profit of the state.
 'Tis nobly spoken.
  
    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
    For you have seen him open 't.
 Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting.
 I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.
 Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you
    To render up the great seal presently
    Into our hands, and to confine yourself  
    To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
    Till you hear further from his Highness.

  WOLSEY.

    The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
    With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
    Weigh'd not a hair of his.
 Plague of your policy!
    You sent me deputy for Ireland;
    Far from his succour, from the King, from all
    That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him;
    Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
    Absolv'd him with an axe.

  WOLSEY.
 This, and all else  
    This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
    I answer is most false.
 The Duke by law
    Found his deserts; how innocent I was
    From any private malice in his end,
    His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
 My lords
    Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
    And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
    To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
    Farewell nobility! Let his Grace go forward
    And dare us with his cap like larks.
 So much fairer  
    And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
    When the King knows my truth.
 This cannot save you.

    I thank my memory I yet remember
    Some of these articles; and out they shall.
 If I blush,
    It is to see a nobleman want manners.

  NORFOLK.

  SURREY.
 That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
    Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin.
 Many more there are,
    Which, since they are of you, and odious,
    I will not taint my mouth with.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-
    Because all those things you have done of late,
    By your power legatine within this kingdom,
    Fall into th' compass of a praemunire-
    That therefore such a writ be sued against you:
    To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
    Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
    Out of the King's protection.
 What, amaz'd
    At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder
    A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
    I am fall'n indeed.

    O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden
    Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
  CROMWELL.
 The heaviest and the worst
    Is your displeasure with the King.

  WOLSEY.
 He will advance thee;
    Some little memory of me will stir him-
    I know his noble nature-not to let
    Thy hopeful service perish too.
  
  CROMWELL.

    The King shall have my service; but my prayers
    For ever and for ever shall be yours.

    Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me.
 Be just, and fear not;
    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
    Thy God's, and truth's; then, if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!
    Serve the King, and-prithee lead me in.
 O Cromwell, Cromwell!
    Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal
    I serv'd my King, he would not in mine age
    Have left me naked to mine enemies.


A street in Westminster

Enter two GENTLEMEN, meeting one another

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 You come to take your stand here, and
      behold
    The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 The citizens,
    I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds-
    As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward-
    In celebration of this day with shows,
    Pageants, and sights of honour.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 Yes; 'tis the list
    Of those that claim their offices this day,
    By custom of the coronation.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 Then two JUDGES.
 With him, the EARL OF SURREY,
       bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an
       earl's coronet.
 Collars of Esses.

    9.
 The old DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold
       wrought with flowers, bearing the QUEEN'S train.

   10.
 A bold brave gentleman.
 Yes.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 These are stars indeed,
    And sometimes falling ones.

                   Exit Procession, with a great flourish of trumpets

               Enter a third GENTLEMAN

    God save you, sir! Where have you been broiling?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 You saw
    The ceremony?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 As well as I am able.
 But what follow'd?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
' So she parted,
    And with the same full state pac'd back again
    To York Place, where the feast is held.
 What two reverend bishops
    Were those that went on each side of the Queen?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 When it comes,
    Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.
 The King has made him Master
    O' th' jewel House,
    And one, already, of the Privy Council.

    Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
    Is to th' court, and there ye shall be my guests:
    Something I can command.
 O Griffith, sick to death!
    My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth,
    Willing to leave their burden.

    So-now, methinks, I feel a little ease.

  GRIFFITH.
  
  GRIFFITH.

    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
    Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;
    Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not,
    But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
 They
      first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain
      changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her
      head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies.
 I shall, assuredly.
 An't like your Grace-
  KATHARINE.
 Go to, kneel.

  CAPUCIUS.

  KATHARINE.
 O, my Lord,  
    The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
    With me since first you knew me.

  KATHARINE.
 No, madam.
 Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
    This to my lord the King.
  
    The last is for my men-they are the poorest,
    But poverty could never draw 'em from me-
    That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
    And something over to remember me by.

  CAPUCIUS.
 By heaven, I will,
    Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
  KATHARINE.
 I thank you, honest lord.
 Embalm me,
    Then lay me forth; although unqueen'd, yet like
    A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.

 Came you from the King, my lord?
  GARDINER.
 What's the matter?
    It seems you are in haste.
 My lord, I love you;
    And durst commend a secret to your ear
    Much weightier than this work.

  GARDINER.
 Methinks I could
    Cry thee amen; and yet my conscience says
    She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
    Deserve our better wishes.

  GARDINER.

                                             Exeunt GARDINER and PAGE

         Enter the KING and the DUKE OF SUFFOLK

  KING.
 Charles, I will play no more to-night;
    My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.

  SUFFOLK.
 What say'st thou, ha?
    To pray for her? What, is she crying out?
  LOVELL.

  KING.
                             Exit SUFFOLK

         Enter SIR ANTHONY DENNY

    Well, sir, what follows?
  DENNY.
 Ay, my good lord.
  
    What!                                     Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY
  CRANMER.
  [Aside]  I am fearful-wherefore frowns he thus?
    'Tis his aspect of terror.
 How now, my lord? You do desire to know
    Wherefore I sent for you.
 Pray you, arise,
    My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
 Know you not
    How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world?
    Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
    Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
    The justice and the truth o' th' question carries
    The due o' th' verdict with it; at what ease
    Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
    To swear against you? Such things have been done.
 If entreaties
    Will render you no remedy, this ring
    Deliver them, and your appeal to us
    There make before them.
 Give her an hundred marks.

  CRANMER.
 Why?
  KEEPER.
 Your Grace must wait till you be call'd for.
                               Exit
  CRANMER.
  [Aside]  'Tis Butts,
    The King's physician; as he pass'd along,
    How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
    Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain,
    This is of purpose laid by some that hate me-
    God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice-
    To quench mine honour; they would shame to make me
    Wait else at door, a fellow councillor,
    'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys.
 Body a me, where is it?
  BUTTS.
 There my lord:  
    The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury;
    Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
    Pages, and footboys.

  KING.

    By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery!
    Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;
    We shall hear more anon.
 Has he had knowledge of it?
  CROMWELL.
 Yes.
 Your Grace may enter now.


      CRANMER approaches the Council table

  CHANCELLOR.

  GARDINER.
 Which reformation must be sudden too,  
    My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
    Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
    But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em
    Till they obey the manage.
 Nor is there living-
    I speak it with a single heart, my lords-
    A man that more detests, more stirs against,
    Both in his private conscience and his place,  
    Defacers of a public peace than I do.

  CRANMER.

  CROMWELL.
 Good Master Secretary,
    I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst  
    Of all this table, say so.
 Why, my lord?
  GARDINER.
 Do not I know you for a favourer
    Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.
 Do.

  GARDINER.
 Receive him,
    And see him safe i' th' Tower.
 Look there, my lords;
    By virtue of that ring I take my cause
    Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
    To a most noble judge, the King my master.

  CHAMBERLAIN.
 This is the King's ring.

  NORFOLK.
 Now let me see the proudest
    He that dares most but wag his finger at thee.
 May it please your Grace-
  KING.

  CRANMER.
 Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons.
 Will these please you?
    Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,
    Embrace and love this man.
 With a true heart
    And brother-love I do it.
 And let heaven
    Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.

  KING.
 Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.
 Do you
    take the court for Paris garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your
    gaping.
 I'll scratch
    your heads.
 Alas, I know not: how gets the tide in?  
    As much as one sound cudgel of four foot-
    You see the poor remainder-could distribute,
    I made no spare, sir.
 You did nothing, sir.

  MAN.

  MAN.
 What should you do, but knock 'em down by th'
    dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some
    strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the
    women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication
    is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening
    will beget a thousand: here will be father, godfather,  
    and all together.

  MAN.
 I miss'd the
    meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out 'Clubs!'
    when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw
    to her succour, which were the hope o' th' Strand, where
    she was quartered.

    At length they came to th' broomstaff to me; I defied 'em
    still; when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em, loose shot,
    deliver'd such a show'r of pebbles that I was fain to draw
    mine honour in and let 'em win the work: the devil was
    amongst 'em, I think surely.


          Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN

  CHAMBERLAIN.

  PORTER.

  PORTER.
 You i' th' camlet, get up o' th' rail;
    I'll peck you o'er the pales else.
  [Kneeling]  And to your royal Grace and the
      good Queen!
    My noble partners and myself thus pray:
    All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
    Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
    May hourly fall upon ye!
  KING.
 Thank you, good Lord Archbishop.
 Her own shall bless her:
    Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
    And hang their heads with sorrow.
 Good grows with her;
    In her days every man shall eat in safety
    Under his own vine what he plants, and sing
    The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.
 To you, my good Lord Mayor,
    And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;
    I have receiv'd much honour by your presence,
    And ye shall find me thankful.


    'Tis ten to one this play can never please
    All that are here.
 Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
    In my behaviour to the majesty,
    The borrowed majesty, of England here.
 Philip of France, in right and true behalf
    Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
    Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
    To this fair island and the territories,
    To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
    Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
    Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
    And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
    Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
 Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
    Controlment for controlment- so answer France.

  CHATILLON.


                  Enter a SHERIFF

  ESSEX.
                          Exit SHERIFF
    Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
    This expedition's charge.
 Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
    Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
    As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge-
    A soldier by the honour-giving hand
    Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.

    Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

    With half that face would he have all my land:
    A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
  ROBERT.
 My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
    Your brother did employ my father much-
  BASTARD.

  ROBERT.

    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
    My father's land, as was my father's will.
 Tell me, how if my brother,
    Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
    Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
    This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
    In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,
    My brother might not claim him; nor your father,  
    Being none of his, refuse him.
 This concludes:
    My mother's son did get your father's heir;
    Your father's heir must have your father's land.

  ROBERT.

  BASTARD.
 What is thy name?
  BASTARD.
 From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
    Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great-
    Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.

  BASTARD.

    Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
    When I was got, Sir Robert was away!  
  ELINOR.

  BASTARD.
 Good fortune come to thee!
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
 Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.
 Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.

    Then, good my mother, let me know my father-
    Some proper man, I hope.

    By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
    To make room for him in my husband's bed.

    Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.
 Till then, fair boy,
    Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

    With him along is come the mother-queen,
    An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
    With her the Lady Blanch of Spain;
    With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd;
    And all th' unsettled humours of the land-
    Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
    With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens-
    Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
    Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
    To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
 How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  AUSTRIA.

    That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
    And this his son; England was Geffrey's right,
    And this is Geffrey's.
 In the name of God,
    How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
    When living blood doth in these temples beat  
    Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest?
  KING JOHN.

  KING JOHN.

    You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
    Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;
    I'll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right;
    Sirrah, look to 't; i' faith I will, i' faith.
 O, well did he become that lion's robe
    That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
  BASTARD.
  
  AUSTRIA.
 I do defy thee, France.

    Submit thee, boy.

  ELINOR.
 Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
    Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
    Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.

    There's a good grandam!
  ARTHUR.
 For our advantage; therefore hear us first.

    Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
    Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
    Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
    Son to the elder brother of this man,  
    And king o'er him and all that he enjoys;
    For this down-trodden equity we tread
    In warlike march these greens before your town,
    Being no further enemy to you
    Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
    In the relief of this oppressed child
    Religiously provokes.
 In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
    For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
 Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.

  KING JOHN.
 As many and as well-born bloods as those-
  BASTARD.
 Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
  BASTARD.
 O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
  KING JOHN.
 Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
    In best appointment all our regiments.

  KING PHILIP.
 Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
    From first to last the onset and retire
    Of both your armies, whose equality
    By our best eyes cannot be censured.
 France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
    Say, shall the current of our right run on?
    Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
    Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
    With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
    Unless thou let his silver water keep
    A peaceful progress to the ocean.

  BASTARD.

  KING PHILIP.
 I from the north.
 Our thunder from the south
    Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

  BASTARD.

    I'll stir them to it.
 Here's a stay
    That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
    Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
    That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;
    Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
    As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
    What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
    He speaks plain cannon-fire, and smoke and bounce;
    He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
    Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
    But buffets better than a fist of France.

    I see a yielding in the looks of France;
    Mark how they whisper.

  KING PHILIP.

                                               [Whispers with BLANCH]
  BASTARD.
 My uncle's will in this respect is mine.

    If he see aught in you that makes him like,
    That anything he sees which moves his liking
    I can with ease translate it to my will;
    Or if you will, to speak more properly,
    I will enforce it eas'ly to my love.

  KING JOHN.
 Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
    Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,
    With her to thee; and this addition more,
    Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.

    Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.
 And, by my faith, this league that we have made  
    Will give her sadness very little cure.

    Brother of England, how may we content
    This widow lady? In her right we came;
    Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
    To our own vantage.

    Go we as well as haste will suffer us
    To this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.

    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.

    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

ACT III.


France.

    Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
    For I am sick and capable of fears,
    Oppress'd with wrongs, and therefore full of fears;
    A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
    A woman, naturally born to fears;
    And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,  
    With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
    But they will quake and tremble all this day.
 Which harm within itself so heinous is
    As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

    France is a bawd to Fortune and King John-
    That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
    Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
    Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
    And leave those woes alone which I alone
    Am bound to under-bear.

  SALISBURY.

 By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
    To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
 Lady Constance, peace!
  CONSTANCE.
 Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
    Thou little valiant, great in villainy!
    Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
    Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
    But when her humorous ladyship is by
    To teach thee safety! Thou art perjur'd too,
    And sooth'st up greatness.
  
  AUSTRIA.
 We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
 Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
 Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
 Though you and all the kings of Christendom
    Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
    Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
    And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
    Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,  
    Who in that sale sells pardon from himself-
    Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,
    This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish;
    Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
    Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.

  PANDULPH.
 Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
    And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
 What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
  LEWIS.
 The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
 O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
  AUSTRIA.
 Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.

  KING PHILIP.

    And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
    So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
    Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
    Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,  
    Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
    As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
    Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
    Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
    And make a riot on the gentle brow
    Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
    My reverend father, let it not be so!
    Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose,
    Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
    To do your pleasure, and continue friends.
 All form is formless, order orderless,
    Save what is opposite to England's love.
 I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
 a civil war set'st oath to oath.

    What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
    And may not be performed by thyself,
    For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
    Is not amiss when it is truly done;
    And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
    The truth is then most done not doing it;
    The better act of purposes mistook
    Is to mistake again; though indirect,
    Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
    And falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
    Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.

    Therefore thy later vows against thy first
    Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
    And better conquest never canst thou make
    Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
    Against these giddy loose suggestions;
    Upon which better part our pray'rs come in,
    If thou vouchsafe them.

  AUSTRIA.

  CONSTANCE.
 O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
  LEWIS.
 Thou shalt not need.
 O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
  KING JOHN.
 France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
 Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
    Is it as he will? Well then, France shall rue.

  BLANCH.
 The sun's o'ercast with blood.
 Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
 Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
    To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire.

    Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.

  KING JOHN.
 To arms let's hie!

  ELINOR.
 Dost thou understand me?
    Thou art his keeper.
  
  KING JOHN.
 Madam, fare you well;
    I'll send those powers o'er to your Majesty.
  [To ARTHUR]  For England, cousin, go;
    Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
    With all true duty.
 So by a roaring tempest on the flood
    A whole armado of convicted sail
    Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowship.

  PANDULPH.
 Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
  KING PHILIP.
 No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.

    I am not mad-I would to heaven I were!
    For then 'tis like I should forget myself.

    I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
    The different plague of each calamity.
 O, what love I note
    In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
    Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall'n,
    Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
    Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
    Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
    Sticking together in calamity.

    But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
    And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
    And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
    As dim and meagre as an ague's fit;
    And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
    When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
    I shall not know him.
 Therefore never, never
    Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
 He talks to me that never had a son.
 You are as fond of grief as of your child.

    Fare you well; had you such a loss as I,
    I could give better comfort than you do.
 I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
         Exit
  LEWIS.

  PANDULPH.
 Before the curing of a strong disease,
    Even in the instant of repair and health,
    The fit is strongest; evils that take leave
    On their departure most of all show evil;
    What have you lost by losing of this day?
  LEWIS.
 Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.

    A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
    Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd,
    And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
    Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up;
    That John may stand then, Arthur needs must fall;
    So be it, for it cannot be but so.

    This act, so evilly borne, shall cool the hearts
    Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,  
    That none so small advantage shall step forth
    To check his reign but they will cherish it;
    No natural exhalation in the sky,
    No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
    No common wind, no customed event,
    But they will pluck away his natural cause
    And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
    Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,
    Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

    Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
    And, O, what better matter breeds for you  
    Than I have nam'd! The bastard Faulconbridge
    Is now in England ransacking the Church,
    Offending charity; if but a dozen French
    Were there in arms, they would be as a can
    To train ten thousand English to their side;
    Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
    Anon becomes a mountain.

    For England go; I will whet on the King.

  EXECUTIONER.
 Good morrow, Hubert.
 As little prince, having so great a tide
    To be more prince, as may be.
 Indeed I have been merrier.
  
    I warrant I love you more than you do me.
 And I will.
 Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
    I knit my handkerchief about your brows-
    The best I had, a princess wrought it me-
    And I did never ask it you again;
    And with my hand at midnight held your head;
    And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,
    Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,  
    Saying 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
    Many a poor man's son would have lyen still,
    And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
    But you at your sick service had a prince.
 O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
    Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

  HUBERT.
 I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.

  ARTHUR.

  ARTHUR.

  HUBERT.
 An if you do, you will but make it blush
    And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.

  HUBERT.
 Adieu.

    Your uncle must not know but you are dead:
    I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports;
    And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
    That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
    Will not offend thee.
 O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
                         Exeunt




SCENE 2.


England.

  PEMBROKE.
 This once again, but that your Highness pleas'd,
    Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
    And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
    The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
    Fresh expectation troubled not the land
    With any long'd-for change or better state.
 In this the antique and well-noted face
    Of plain old form is much disfigured;
    And like a shifted wind unto a sail
    It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
    Startles and frights consideration,
    Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,
    For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.

  PEMBROKE.
 To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
    We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness
    To overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,
    Since all and every part of what we would  
    Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.

  KING JOHN.

  PEMBROKE.
 Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
    To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
    Both for myself and them- but, chief of all,
    Your safety, for the which myself and them
    Bend their best studies, heartily request
    Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint
    Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
    To break into this dangerous argument:
    If what in rest you have in right you hold,
    Why then your fears-which, as they say, attend
    The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up
    Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days  
    With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
    The rich advantage of good exercise?
    That the time's enemies may not have this
    To grace occasions, let it be our suit
    That you have bid us ask his liberty;
    Which for our goods we do no further ask
    Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
    Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
 The colour of the King doth come and go
    Between his purpose and his conscience,
    Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.
 And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
    The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

    This must be answer'd either here or hence.


                 Enter a MESSENGER

    A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
    That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
    So foul a sky clears not without a storm.

    Pour down thy weather-how goes all in France?
  MESSENGER.
 From France to England.
 Never such a pow'r
    For any foreign preparation  
    Was levied in the body of a land.

  KING JOHN.

  BASTARD.

    But as I travell'd hither through the land,
    I find the people strangely fantasied;
    Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams.

  KING JOHN.

                                                         Exit BASTARD
    Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
    Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
    And be thou he.
 Old men and beldams in the streets
    Do prophesy upon it dangerously;
    Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
    And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
    And whisper one another in the ear;
    And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
    Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
    With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.

  KING JOHN.
 O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
    Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
    Witness against us to damnation!
    How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
    Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
    A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
    Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
    This murder had not come into my mind;
    But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
    Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,
    Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
    I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
    And thou, to be endeared to a king,
    Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

    O, answer not; but to my closet bring
    The angry lords with all expedient haste.

  PEMBROKE.

 Our souls religiously confirm thy words.

 Upon my soul-
  BASTARD.

    I am amaz'd, methinks, and lose my way
    Among the thorns and dangers of this world.

    How easy dost thou take all England up!
    From forth this morsel of dead royalty
    The life, the right, and truth of all this realm
    Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
    To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth
    The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.

    Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
    Hold out this tempest.
 Bear away that child,
    And follow me with speed.
 Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
    And from his Holiness use all your power
    To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd.

  PANDULPH.

  KING JOHN.

    What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
    And fright him there, and make him tremble there?
    O, let it not be said! Forage, and run
    To meet displeasure farther from the doors
    And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.
 The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
    And I have made a happy peace with him;
    And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
    Led by the Dauphin.
 My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
    And keep it safe for our remembrance;
    Return the precedent to these lords again,
    That, having our fair order written down,
    Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
    May know wherefore we took the sacrament,
    And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
 Upon our sides it never shall be broken.

    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm;  
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes
    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.

    What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?

             Enter the BASTARD, attended

  BASTARD.
 The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
    And will not temporize with my entreaties;
    He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.

    This apish and unmannerly approach,
    This harness'd masque and unadvised revel
    This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
    The King doth smile at; and is well prepar'd
    To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
    From out the circle of his territories.
 Do but start
    And echo with the clamour of thy drum,
    And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
    That shall reverberate all as loud as thine:
    Sound but another, and another shall,
    As loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear
    And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand-
    Not trusting to this halting legate here,
    Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need-
    Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
    A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
    To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

  BASTARD.
 Badly, I fear.
 How fares your Majesty?
  KING JOHN.
 My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
    Desires your Majesty to leave the field
    And send him word by me which way you go.

  KING JOHN.

  MESSENGER.
 That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
    In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
 Lead me to the revolts of England here.

  PEMBROKE.
 Have I not hideous death within my view,
    Retaining but a quantity of life,
    Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
    Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
    What in the world should make me now deceive,
    Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
    Why should I then be false, since it is true
    That I must die here, and live hence by truth?
    I say again, if Lewis do will the day,
    He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
    Behold another day break in the east;  
    But even this night, whose black contagious breath
    Already smokes about the burning crest
    Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
    Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
    Paying the fine of rated treachery
    Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives.

  SALISBURY.
 The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
    But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
    When English measure backward their own ground
    In faint retire.
 Who was he that said
    King John did fly an hour or two before
    The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?
  MESSENGER.
 Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
 Of the part of England.

  BASTARD.
 Who thou wilt.
 And if thou please,
    Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
    I come one way of the Plantagenets.

  HUBERT.

  BASTARD.
 Brief, then; and what's the news?
  HUBERT.
 Show me the very wound of this ill news;
    I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
 The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
    I left him almost speechless and broke out
    To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
    The better arm you to the sudden time
    Than if you had at leisure known of this.

  BASTARD.
 Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
    And brought Prince Henry in their company;
    At whose request the King hath pardon'd them,
    And they are all about his Majesty.
 Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
    And tempt us not to bear above our power!
    I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
    Passing these flats, are taken by the tide-
    These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
    Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
 Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
    To set a form upon that indigest
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.


                 Enter the BASTARD

  BASTARD.
 O, I am scalded with my violent motion
    And spleen of speed to see your Majesty!
  KING JOHN.
 It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
    The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
    Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,  
    And brings from him such offers of our peace
    As we with honour and respect may take,
    With purpose presently to leave this war.
 Nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
    For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
    To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
    To the disposing of the Cardinal;
    With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
    If you think meet, this afternoon will post
    To consummate this business happily.
 And you, my noble Prince,
    With other princes that may best be spar'd,
    Shall wait upon your father's funeral.

  PRINCE HENRY.
 Thither shall it, then;
    And happily may your sweet self put on
    The lineal state and glory of the land!  
    To whom, with all submission, on my knee
    I do bequeath my faithful services
    And true subjection everlastingly.

  SALISBURY.

  PRINCE HENRY.
 O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
    Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.

 Who is it in the press that calls on me?
    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
    Cry "Caesar.
" Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
 Beware the ides of March.

  CAESAR.
 What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.

  SOOTHSAYER.
 I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.

    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
    What is it that you would impart to me?
    If it be aught toward the general good,
    Set honor in one eye and death i' the other  
    And I will look on both indifferently.
  
    The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
 'Tis true, this god did shake;
    His coward lips did from their color fly,
    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    Did lose his luster.
 Shout.
 Another general shout!
    I do believe that these applauses are
    For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
"
    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
    When went there by an age since the great flood
    But it was famed with more than with one man?
    When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome
    That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
    Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
    When there is in it but one only man.
 That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
    What you would work me to, I have some aim.
 I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.


            Re-enter Caesar and his Train.

 The games are done, and Caesar is returning.

  BRUTUS.
 Casca will tell us what the matter is.

  CAESAR.
 He reads much,
    He is a great observer, and he looks
    Quite through the deeds of men.
 Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
    That Caesar looks so sad.
 What was the second noise for?
  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.
 Why, Antony.
 Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
 It was
    mere foolery; I did not mark it.
 And then he offered it
    the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he
    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands  
    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
    stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
    almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.
 But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA.
 No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

  BRUTUS.
 What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA.
 Three or
    four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave
    him with all their hearts.
 But there's no heed to be taken of
    them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done
    no less.
 Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA.
 Good, I will expect you.

    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
    Which gives men stomach to digest his words
    With better appetite.
 I will do so.

    Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see  
    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet
    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
    Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.

A street.

  CICERO.
 A common slave- you know him well by sight-
    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn  
    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
    Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.

  CASCA.


  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS.

  CASCA.
 A very pleasing night to honest men.

  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.

    But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,
    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
 Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    In every place save here in Italy.
 And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
    Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf
    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
 Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
 Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
  CINNA.

  CASCA.

  BRUTUS.

    When it is lighted, come and call me here.

  LUCIUS.

    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking.
 But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend.

                                           Gives him the letter.
 Look in the calendar and bring me word.

  LUCIUS.
                                     Exit.

    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.

    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

                        Re-enter Lucius.

  BRUTUS.


    Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,
                Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius.

    Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
  BRUTUS.

    This is Trebonius.

    What watchful cares do interpose themselves
    Betwixt your eyes and night?
  CASSIUS.

  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.
  
  BRUTUS.

  CASCA.
  
  CASSIUS.

  DECIUS.
 Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS.
 Decius, well urged.
 Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
 There is no fear in him-let him not die,  
    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

  CASSIUS.
 By the eighth hour.
 We'll leave you, Brutus,
    And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
    What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.
 Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
 Nor for yours neither.

    It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
    And, could it work so much upon your shape
    As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
    I should not know you, Brutus.
 Kneel not, gentle Portia.

  PORTIA.

    Boy, stand aside.
 But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS.
 Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.

  SERVANT.


                         Enter Calpurnia.

  CAESAR.

  CALPURNIA.
 When beggars die, there are no comets seen;  
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.


                      Re-enter Servant.

    No, Caesar shall not.

    We are two lions litter'd in one day,  
    And I the elder and more terrible.

    And Caesar shall go forth.

  CALPURNIA.

    We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,
    And he shall say you are not well today.

    Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
 Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
    And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

  CALPURNIA.

  CAESAR.

    And these does she apply for warnings and portents
    And evils imminent, and on her knee  
    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.

    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
    For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.

    This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

  CAESAR.

    And know it now, the Senate have concluded
    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
 Besides, it were a mock
    Apt to be render'd, for someone to say
    "Break up the Senate till another time,
    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.

    What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
    Good morrow, Casca.

    What is't o'clock?
  BRUTUS.

  CAESAR.
 [Aside.





SCENE III.

Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.
 I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;
    Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.

    Why dost thou stay?
  LUCIUS.

    O constancy, be strong upon my side!
    Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
    I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.

  LUCIUS.
 Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
 Come hither, fellow;
    Which way hast thou been?
  SOOTHSAYER.

  PORTIA.

    I'll get me to a place more void and there
    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
 Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,
Trebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.
 Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
 What, is the fellow mad?
  PUBLIUS.


  POPILIUS.
 What enterprise, Popilius?
  POPILIUS.
 Fare you well.

                                             Advances to Caesar.

  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

    Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
  
                                    Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.
 I must prevent thee, Cimber.
 Be not fond
    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
    That will be thaw'd from the true quality
    With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,
    Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.

    Thy brother by decree is banished.
  
    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
 I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,
    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

  CAESAR.
 Great Caesar-
  CAESAR.
 Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
  CASCA.
 Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

  METELLUS.
 And leave us, Publius, lest that the people
    Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.
 Where is Antony?
  TREBONIUS.
 Stoop then, and wash.
 So oft as that shall be,
    So often shall the knot of us be call'd
    The men that gave their country liberty.


                        Enter a Servant.


  BRUTUS.

    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
    May safely come to him and be resolved
    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
    So well as Brutus living, but will follow
    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
    With all true faith.
 So says my master Antony.
 I know that we shall have him well to friend.

  
                          Re-enter Antony.


  BRUTUS.

    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
    Fulfill your pleasure.
 Live a thousand years,
    I shall not find myself so apt to die;
    No place will please me so, no means of death,
    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
    The choice and master spirits of this age.

  CASSIUS.
 I doubt not of your wisdom.
  
    Let each man render me his bloody hand.

    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
    If then thy spirit look upon us now,
    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
    To see thy Antony making his peace,
    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
    Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?
    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
    It would become me better than to close
    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.

    O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
 You shall, Mark Antony.
] You know not what you do.
 Do not consent
    That Antony speak in his funeral.

    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
 Prepare the body then, and follow us.

  ANTONY.
 I do, Mark Antony.

  SERVANT.
 Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
 Is thy master coming?
  SERVANT.
 He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.





SCENE II.

The Forum.

                                    Brutus goes into the pulpit.

  THIRD CITIZEN.

    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be
    silent, that you may hear.
 If
    there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to
    him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
 Who is here so
    rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I
    offended.
 Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If
    any, speak, for him have I offended.
 I pause for a reply.
 The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was  
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.

  BRUTUS.

    Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech
    Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,
    By our permission, is allow'd to make.

  FIRST CITIZEN.

    We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
  
  SECOND CITIZEN.

  SECOND CITIZEN.

  THIRD CITIZEN.
 There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

  ANTONY.

    Let but the commons hear this testament-
    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-
    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    Unto their issue.

  ANTONY.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 The will! The testament!
  SECOND CITIZEN.
 Come down.

  SECOND CITIZEN.

  ANTONY.
 Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
 Stand back; room, bear back!
  ANTONY.

    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
    That made them do it.

  ANTONY.

  ALL.
 Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
 Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
 Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.

    Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?
  FIRST CITIZEN.
 Now let it work.
 Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
 Where is he?
  SERVANT.

  SERVANT.

A street.


  CINNA.
 Where do you dwell?
  FOURTH CITIZEN.
 Ay, and briefly.
 Ay, and truly, you were best.
 What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I
    a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly  
    and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

  SECOND CITIZEN.

  FOURTH CITIZEN.

  CINNA.
 Your name, sir, truly.

  FIRST CITIZEN.

  CINNA.
 Some to Decius' house, and some  
    to Casca's, some to Ligarius'.
 Away, go!             Exeunt.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.

A house in Rome.
 Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
 Prick him down, Antony.

  LEPIDUS.
 Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
    And though we lay these honors on this man
    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
    To groan and sweat under the business,
    Either led or driven, as we point the way;
    And having brought our treasure where we will,
    Then take we down his load and turn him off,
    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
    And graze in commons.
 Do not talk of him
    But as a property.

  OCTAVIUS.
                               Exeunt.


Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and Pindarus meet them.
 Stand, ho!
  LUCILIUS.

  PINDARUS.
 Let me be resolved.
 With courtesy and with respect enough,  
    But not with such familiar instances,
    Nor with such free and friendly conference,
    As he hath used of old.

  BRUTUS.
 Thou hast described
    A hot friend cooling.
 Ever note, Lucilius,
    When love begins to sicken and decay
    It useth an enforced ceremony.

    March gently on to meet him.
 Stand, ho!
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS.
 Cassius, be content,
    Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.

    Before the eyes of both our armies here,
    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
    Let us not wrangle.





SCENE III.
 That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
    You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
    For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
    Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
  
  CASSIUS.
 You forget yourself
    To hedge me in.
 Hear me, for I will speak.
 You say you are a better soldier:
    Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,  
    And it shall please me well.
 For mine own part,
    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
 When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

  BRUTUS.
 I denied you not.
 I did not.
 He was but a fool
    That brought my answer back.
 I do not, till you practise them on me.
 A friendly eye could never see such faults.

  BRUTUS.
  
    Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
    Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
    They be alone.
] You shall not come to them.
 [Within.
 How now, what's the matter?
  POET.
 For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
    Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
    For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
 Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

    What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
    Companion, hence!
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.
 I did not think you could have been so angry.
 Of your philosophy you make no use,
    If you give place to accidental evils.
 No man bears sorrow better.
 Portia is dead.

  CASSIUS.
 She is dead.

  CASSIUS.


  BRUTUS.
 Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS.

    Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  BRUTUS.

  MESSALA.
 No, my lord.
 Why, farewell, Portia.

    With meditating that she must die once
    I have the patience to endure it now.
 Even so great men great losses should endure.

  CASSIUS.
 Well, to our work alive.

  BRUTUS.
 Good reasons must of force give place to better.

    There is a tide in the affairs of men
    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;
    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

    There is no more to say?
  CASSIUS.
 Good night.
 Lucius!

                       Re-enter Lucius.

  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS.
 Good night, my lord.
 Where is thy instrument?
  LUCIUS.

  VARRO.

    Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
    And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
  LUCIUS.

    I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

    This is a sleepy tune.
 O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.


                 Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
 Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
 Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
 The strings, my lord, are false.
 Didst thou see anything?  
  LUCIUS.
 Nothing, my lord.

  BRUTUS.
 Sirrah Claudio!
    [To Varro.
 Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO.
 Nor I, my lord.
 It shall be done, my lord.
             Exeunt.

The plains of Philippi.

    It proves not so.
 Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.

  BRUTUS.
 Words before blows.

    This tongue had not offended so today,
    If Cassius might have ruled.
 If arguing make us sweat,
    The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
 Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
    Unless thou bring'st them with thee.

  OCTAVIUS.
 [Stands forth.
] My lord?
                             Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.
 Messala!
  MESSALA.
] What says my general?
  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS.
 But this same day
    Must end that work the ides of March begun.

    Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
 O, that a man might know
    The end of this day's business ere it come!
    But it sufficeth that the day will end,
    And then the end is known.


  BRUTUS.

    Let them set on at once, for I perceive
    But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,
    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
         Exeunt.
 Titinius, if thou lovest me,
    Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,
    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
    And here again, that I may rest assured
    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
     Exit.

  CASSIUS.
 Come down; behold no more.

    O, coward that I am, to live so long,
    To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
                                              Pindarus descends.
 [Pindarus stabs him.
                  Dies.
 So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will.


  MESSALA.
 It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
    Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
    As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
 These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
 All disconsolate,
    With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
 He lies not like the living.
 O my heart!
  MESSALA.
  
  MESSALA.
 Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
        Exit Messala.

    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.

  BRUTUS.
                     Low alarums.
 Brave Titinius!
    Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius!  
  BRUTUS.
 Friends, I owe moe tears
    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.

    I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
 Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus, young Cato,
Lucilius, and others.

    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
  BRUTUS.
 And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
    Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!       Exit.

  FIRST SOLDIER.
 A noble prisoner!  
  SECOND SOLDIER.


    Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
 Where is he?
  LUCILIUS.


  BRUTUS.
 Slaying is the word:
    It is a deed in fashion.
        Whispers.
 I'll rather kill myself.

  DARDANIUS.
 Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
    That it runs over even at his eyes.
 Why, this, Volumnius:
    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
    And this last night here in Philippi fields.
 Not so, my lord.

  CLITUS.

    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.

    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
  
  BRUTUS.


  OCTAVIUS.

  MESSALA.
 Octavius, then take him to follow thee
    That did the latest service to my master.

  ANTONY.

    Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,
    Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.

THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR

by William Shakespeare




Dramatis Personae

      Lear, King of Britain.

      King of France.

      Duke of Cornwall.

      Doctor.

      A Captain under Edmund's command.

      A Herald.

      Servants to Cornwall.
]

Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.
 [Kent and Glouceste converse.

  Glou.

  Kent.
 I have so often
     blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.
 I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so
     proper.

  Kent.

  Edm.
 Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

  Lear.

  Cor.
 To thine and Albany's issue
     Be this perpetual.

  Reg.
- Now, our joy,
     Although the last, not least; to whose young love
     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

  Lear.
 Nothing?
  Cor.
 Nothing can come of nothing.
  
  Cor.
 The sway,
     Revenue, execution of the rest,
     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
     This coronet part betwixt you.
 Kent, on thy life, no more!
  Kent.

  Lear.
, Corn.

     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
     He'll shape his old course in a country new.
 Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.

  Lear.
 Most royal Majesty,
     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
     Nor will you tender less.
 Sir, there she stands.

  Lear.
 Pardon me, royal sir.

     Election makes not up on such conditions.
 [To France] For you, great King,
     I would not from your love make such a stray
     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
     T' avert your liking a more worthier way
     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
     Almost t' acknowledge hers.
 I yet beseech your Majesty,
     If for I want that glib and oily art
     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,
     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,
     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,
     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
     But even for want of that for which I am richer-
     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue

     Hath lost me in your liking.
 Will you have her?
     She is herself a dowry.

  Lear.

  France.

     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.

     Thou losest here, a better where to find.

  Lear.

     Come, noble Burgundy.

  France.

  Cor.
 Come, my fair Cordelia.
 I think our father will hence to-night.

  Gon.
 The observation we
     have made of it hath not been little.

  Gon.
 We must do something, and i' th' heat.

The Earl of Gloucester's Castle.
 I grow; I prosper.
 Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?
     And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?
     Confin'd to exhibition? All this done
     Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
  Edm.

  Glou.
 What paper were you reading?
  Edm.
 Let's see.
 Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need
     spectacles.
 Give me the letter, sir.
 If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his;
     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
 It is his.
 Think you so?
  Edm.

  Glou.
 I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
 We have seen the best
     of our time.
 I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as
     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,
     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,
     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless
     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
 Come, come! When saw you my father last?  
  Edg.

  Edm.

  Edm.

                                                     Exit Edgar.

     A credulous father! and a brother noble,
     Whose nature is so far from doing harms
     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
     My practices ride easy! I see the business.

     Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
     All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
 Ay, madam.
 Very well, madam.
 Advise your fellows so.

     I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
     That I may speak.
 If but as well I other accents borrow,
     That can my speech defuse, my good intent
     May carry through itself to that full issue
     For which I raz'd my likeness.
 Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.

  Kent.
 I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in
     telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly.
 That which
     ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me
     is diligence.

  Kent.
 Nay, an thou
     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.

     There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's
     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will.
 If
     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
 A pestilent gall to me!
  Fool.

  Lear.

  Lear.
 Dost thou call me fool, boy?
  Fool.
 All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast
     born with.
 Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two
     crowns.
 Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the
     meat, the two crowns of the egg.
 When thou clovest thy crown i'
     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on
     thy back o'er the dirt.


  Lear.
 I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.

     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue.

  Gon.

  Fool.
 I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
     I had daughters.
 Which they will make an obedient father.

  Lear.
 Epicurism and lust
     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
     Than a grac'd palace.

     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
     Than the sea-monster!
  Alb.

  Lear.
 It may be so, my lord.
 Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  Gon.
 What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
     Within a fortnight?
  Alb.
 I'll tell thee.
 Yea, is it come to this?
     Let it be so.
 Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.

  Gon.

     Let me still take away the harms I fear,
     Not fear still to be taken.
 Yes, madam.
 Take you some company, and away to horse!
     Inform her full of my particular fear,
     And thereto add such reasons of your own
     As may compact it more.
 Nay then-

Scene V.

Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace.
 Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
 If your diligence be not speedy, I
     shall be there afore you.
 I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.

  Fool.
 Then I prithee be merry.
 Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters,
     and leave his horns without a case.
 The reason why the seven stars
     are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.

  Edm.
 But where is he?
  Edm.

  Glou.
 The noble Duke my master,

 If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
     Which can pursue th' offender.

  Edm.
 'Twas my duty, sir.

  Glou.
 For you, Edmund,
     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.

     You we first seize on.

 No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour.

  Kent.

     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade.
 This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd
     At suit of his grey beard-
  Kent.
 'Spare my grey
     beard,' you wagtail?
  Corn.
 Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
 What, art thou mad, old fellow?
  Glou.
 How fell you out? Say that.
 No contraries hold more antipathy
     Than I and such a knave.
 I never gave him any.
 None of these rogues and cowards
     But Ajax is their fool.

     On whose employment I was sent to you.
 Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
     You should not use me so.

  Glou.
 I am sorry for thee, friend.

 Good King, that must approve the common saw,
     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
     To the warm sun!
     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
     That by thy comfortable beams I may
     Peruse this letter.
 No port is free, no place

     Does not attend my taking.

  Kent.

  Kent.
 No, no, they would not!
  Kent.
 By Juno, I swear ay!
  Lear.
 They durst not do't;
     They would not, could not do't.

     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
     The shame which here it suffers.


          Fathers that wear rags
            Do make their children blind;
          But fathers that bear bags
            Shall see their children kind.
 Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
  Kent.
 Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
 The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.
 I would have all well betwixt you.


  Lear.

  Lear.
 O, sir, you are old!
     Nature in you stands on the very verge
     Of her confine.
 [rises] Never, Regan!
     She hath abated me of half my train;
     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,  
     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
 You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
     To fall and blast her pride!
  Reg.

     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
     Thee o'er to harshness.
 'Tis not in thee
     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
     Against my coming in.

 Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,
     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,

     I am cold myself.
 Where is this straw, my fellow?

     That which my father loses- no less than all.


  Kent.

     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough
     For nature to endure.

  Kent.

     Invades us to the skin.
 Thou'dst shun a bear;
     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth.
 Filial ingratitude!
     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand  
     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!
     No, I will weep no more.

     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
     No more of that.

  Lear.

     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
     On things would hurt me more.

     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;  
     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them

  Lear.
 Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill.
 This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
 Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let
     him trot by.

     this? Consider him well.

     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.

     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
     animal as thou art.

 My duty cannot suffer
     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.

  Lear.
 Ah, that good Kent!
     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,
     I am almost mad myself.
 I had a son,
     Now outlaw'd from my blood.
 I lov'd him, friend-

  Edg.
 Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
 Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
     hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my  
     hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.
 Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
 We'll go to supper i' th' morning.


                          Enter Gloucester.


  Glou.
 Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.

     There is a litter ready; lay him in't
     And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
     Both welcome and protection.
 Oppressed nature sleeps.

     This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
     Which, if convenience will not allow,
     Stand in hard cure.

     Thou must not stay behind.

     How light and portable my pain seems now,
     When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,
     He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
     Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
     When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
     In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
  
     What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!
     Lurk, lurk.

 Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

 To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
     Speak.
 Because I would not see thy cruel nails

     Upon the dunghill.
 Regan, I bleed apace.
 Go thou.


Enter Edgar.
 To be worst,
     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
 Welcome then,
     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
     Owes nothing to thy blasts.


                 Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.


     But who comes here?
     My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
     Life would not yield to age.

     I am worse than e'er I was.
 The worst is not

  Glou.
 Alack, sir, he is mad!

 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.

     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.
 [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
 Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
     Have humbled to all strokes.
 Ay, master.


  Gon.
 Welcome, my lord.


     Now, where's your master?
  Osw.
' Of Gloucester's treachery
     And of the loyal service of his son
     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot
     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.

     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
     What like, offensive.
 [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.
 He'll not feel wrongs
     Which tie him to an answer.
 Back, Edmund, to my brother.

     Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.
 This trusty servant
     Shall pass between us.

     To thee a woman's services are due;
     My fool usurps my body.
                          Exit.

  Alb.
 O vain fool!
  Alb.
 O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,
     Slain by his servant, going to put out
     The other eye of Gloucester.
 A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
     Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
     To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
     But not without that harmful stroke which since
     Hath pluck'd him after.

  Alb.

The French camp near Dover.


Enter Kent and a Gentleman.
 Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his
     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much
     fear and danger that his personal return was most required and
     necessary.

  Kent.
 Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
     grief?
  Gent.
 Then away she started
     To deal with grief alone.

  Kent.

  Gent.
 Why, good sir?
  Kent.

  Gent.





Scene IV.


  Cor.

     Therefore great France
     My mourning and important tears hath pitied.

Gloucester's Castle.
 But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
  Osw.

  Reg.
 What might import my sister's letter to him?
  Osw.
 Our troops set forth to-morrow.

     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.

  Osw.
 Y'are! I know't.

     If you do find him, pray you give him this;  
     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.

     So farewell.

     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
 Fare thee well.





Scene VI.
 You do climb up it now.
 Horrible steep.

  Edg.

  Glou.
 With all my heart.
 O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.
 Away, and let me die.
 From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.

  Glou.

  Edg.
  
  Glou.
 I do remember now.

  Edg.


         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].

  
     But who comes here?
     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
     His master thus.

  Edg.
 I know that voice.
 To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and
     'no' too was no good divinity.

     I pardon that man's life.

     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
     Does lecher in my sight.

     Behold yond simp'ring dame,
     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
     That minces virtue, and does shake the head
     To hear of pleasure's name.

  Glou.
 O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
     Shall so wear out to naught.
 Read thou this
     challenge; mark but the penning of it.
 Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.

  Edg.
 [aside] I would not take this from report.
 It is,
     And my heart breaks at it.
 O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no
     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse
     in a light.

  Glou.

     Look with thine ears.
 And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.

     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
     For which thou whip'st her.
 Plate sin with gold,  
     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.

     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.

  Edg.
 O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
     Reason, in madness!
  Lear.
 We came crying hither;
     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
     We wawl and cry.

     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
     A troop of horse with felt.


  Gent.
 O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.

  Lear.
 What!
     I will be jovial.
 A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter
     Who redeems nature from the general curse
     Which twain have brought her to.
 But, by your favour,
     How near's the other army?
  Gent.
 You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
     To die before you please!
  Edg.
 Now let thy friendly hand
     Put strength enough to't.
 Wherefore, bold peasant,
     Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
     Lest that th' infection of his fortune take
     Like hold on thee.

  Osw.
 Let go, slave, or thou diest!
  Edg.
]  
  Osw.
 Slave, thou hast slain me.
 Villain, take my purse.
 A serviceable villain,
     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
     As badness would desire.

     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
 You have many
     opportunities to cut him off.
 Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my
     jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the
     place for your labour.

           'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,
                                                          'Goneril.
 How stiff is my vile sense,
     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.

                                                A drum afar off.

  Edg.

     Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
        Exeunt.





Scene VII.

A tent in the French camp.


Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman.
 O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
     To match thy goodness? My life will be too short
     And every measure fail me.

  Cor.

     My boon I make it that you know me not
     Till time and I think meet.
 Then be't so, my good lord.
 In the heaviness of sleep
     We put fresh garments on him.

  Cor.

                                                          Music.

  Doct.

  Doct.
 Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
 Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
     I am mightily abus'd.
 Let's see.
 Would I were assur'd
     Of my condition!
  Cor.

     No, sir, you must not kneel.

     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

     You have some cause, they have not.
 In your own kingdom, sir.

  Lear.
 Do not abuse me.
 You must bear with me.

  Gent.
 Who is conductor of his people?
  Kent.

 I am doubtful that you have been conjunct  
     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
 No, by mine honour, madam.
 Dear my lord,
     Be not familiar with her.

     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,
     With others whom the rigour of our state
     Forc'd to cry out.
 For this business,
     It toucheth us as France invades our land,
     Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,
     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
 Let's then determine
     With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.

  Reg.
 Pray you go with us.

  Gon.

  Edg.
 I'll overtake you.
- Speak.

  Edg.
 If you miscarry,
     Your business of the world hath so an end,
     And machination ceases.
 The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.
                             Exit.


Alarum within.
 What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
     Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
     Ripeness is all.

The British camp, near Dover.


  Edm.
 Some officers take them away.

     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
  Lear.

     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
     And ask of thee forgiveness.

  Capt.


  Alb.
 Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
     And fortune led you well.
 Sir, I thought it fit
     To send the old and miserable King
     To some retention and appointed guard;
     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,  
     To pluck the common bosom on his side
     And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
     Which do command them.

     The question of Cordelia and her father
     Requires a fitter place.

     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
     Ere you had spoke so far.
 Not so hot!

     More than in your addition.
 In my rights

     And read out this.


    Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.
 Which is that adversary?

     I would have made them skip.
 I'll tell you straight.

  Kent.
 If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,  
     One of them we behold.

 Very bootless.

     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.

  KATHARINE, lady attending on the Princess
  JAQUENETTA, a country wench
  
  Lords, Attendants, etc.

    You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,
    Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
    My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes  
    That are recorded in this schedule here.

    If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
    Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

    Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits
    Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

  BEROWNE.

  KING.
 These be the stops that hinder study quite,
    And train our intellects to vain delight.

    These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
    That give a name to every fixed star
    Have no more profit of their shining nights
    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.

  KING.

  BEROWNE.
 Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.
 Marry, that did I.
 A dangerous law against gentility.

    But is there no quick recreation granted?
  KING.

    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
    For interim to our studies shall relate,
    In high-born words, the worth of many a knight
    From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.

  LONGAVILLE.
 Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
    And so to study three years is but short.
 What wouldst?
  DULL.

  DULL.

  KING.
 A letter from the magnificent Armado.

  COSTARD.
 In what manner?
  COSTARD.
 As we would hear an oracle.

  KING.
 [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole
    dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring
    patron'-
  COSTARD.
 Not a word of Costard yet.
 [Reads] 'So it is'-
  COSTARD.
 [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I
    did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome
    physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook
    myself to walk.
 With a wench.
 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy
    more sweet understanding, a woman.
'
  DULL.

  KING.
 I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
    marking of it.

  COSTARD.

  KING.
 Well, it was proclaimed damsel.

  KING.
 It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
 This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.

  COSTARD.

  KING.

  COSTARD.
 I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
    These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
 A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
    appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

  ARMADO.
 And therefore apt, because quick.
 In thy condign praise.

  MOTH.
 How many is one thrice told?
  ARMADO.
 You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
  
  MOTH.

  MOTH.
 True.

  ARMADO.
 If drawing
    my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
    the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
    ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy.
 Hercules, master.
 Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great
    carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a
    porter; and he was in love.
 A woman, master.

  ARMADO.
 Of the sea-water green, sir.

  ARMADO.
 Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such
    colours.
 My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!
  ARMADO.
 Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
  MOTH.

  ARMADO.
 Boy, I do love  
    that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind
    Costard; she deserves well.
 Forbear till this company be past.
 Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and
    you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a
    must fast three days a week.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.

  JAQUENETTA.
 Come, Jaquenetta, away.
 Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
    stomach.

  MOTH.

  COSTARD.
 I thank God I have as little patience as
    another man, and therefore I can be quiet.
 Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum;
    for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth.

The park

Enter the PRINCESS OF FRANCE, with three attending ladies,
ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, and two other LORDS

  BOYET.

    Consider who the King your father sends,
    To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
    Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
    To parley with the sole inheritor
    Of all perfections that a man may owe,
    Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
    Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.

    But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
    You are not ignorant all-telling fame
    Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,
    Till painful study shall outwear three years,
    No woman may approach his silent court.

    Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
    To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
    Bold of your worthiness, we single you
    As our best-moving fair solicitor.
  
                                                      Exit BOYET
    Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
    That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
  FIRST LORD.

    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
    If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
    Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will,
    Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
    It should none spare that come within his power.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  ROSALINE.
 God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,
    That every one her own hath garnished
    With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
  FIRST LORD.
 Here comes Boyet.
 The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and
    welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  BEROWNE.

  KATHARINE.
 Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

  KATHARINE.

  BEROWNE.
 Fair fall the face it covers!  
  BEROWNE.
 Nay, then will I be gone.
 You do the King my father too much wrong,
    And wrong the reputation of your name,
    In so unseeming to confess receipt
    Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
 Satisfy me so.

    You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates;
    But here without you shall be so receiv'd
    As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
    Though so denied fair harbour in my house.

                                            Exit with attendants
  BEROWNE.

  BEROWNE.
 I would you heard it groan.

  ROSALINE.

  BEROWNE.
 Would that do it good?
  ROSALINE.
'
  BEROWNE.
 The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
 She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

  LONGAVILLE.

  BOYET.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 It was well done of you to take him at his
    word.
 Two hot sheeps, marry!
  BOYET.
 Not so, gentle beast;
    My lips are no common, though several they be.
 Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
      agree;
    This civil war of wits were much better used
    On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.

  BOYET.
 With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.

    His face's own margent did quote such amazes
    That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
 Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but
    grim.

                                         [MOTH sings Concolinel]
  ARMADO.
 No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
    end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your
    eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the
    throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime
    through the nose, as if you snuff'd up love by smelling love,
    with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with
    your arms cross'd on your thin-belly doublet, like a rabbit on a
    spit, or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old
    painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.

  ARMADO.
 By my penny of observation.
 And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.
 By heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by
    her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with
    her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you
    cannot enjoy her.
  
  MOTH.
 Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
    Until the goose came out of door,
           And stay'd the odds by adding four.

  ARMADO.
  Until the goose came out of door,
           Staying the odds by adding four.
 True, and I for a plantain.

  ARMADO.

    I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
    Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

  COSTARD.
 O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
    goose, in this.
 I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in  
    lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this
    significant [giving a letter] to the country maid Jaquenetta;
    there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is
    rewarding my dependents.

    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.
'- 'No, I'll give
    you a remuneration.
 I will never buy and sell out of
    this word.
 Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for
    a remuneration?
  BEROWNE.
 What is a remuneration?  
  COSTARD.

  BEROWNE.
 Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
 Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.
 Thou knowest not what it is.
 I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

  BEROWNE.
 Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration; a
    'leven-pence farthing better; most sweet gardon! I will do it,
    sir, in print.
 And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;
    A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
    A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
    A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
    Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
    This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
    This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
    Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
    Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
    Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
    Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
    Sole imperator, and great general
    Of trotting paritors.

 What, what? First praise me, and again say no?
    O short-liv'd pride! Not fair? Alack for woe!  
  FORESTER.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.

    O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
    A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
 Now mercy goes to kill,
    And shooting well is then accounted ill;
    Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
    Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
    If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
    That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
 Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
    Only for praise sake, when they strive to be

 Boyet, you can carve.

    And he from forage will incline to play.
 I am much deceived but I remember the style.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Come, lords,  
      away.
 Shall I teach you to know?
  BOYET.

    Finely put off!
  BOYET.

    Finely put on!
  ROSALINE.
 And who is your deer?
  ROSALINE.
 Have I hit her now?
  ROSALINE.
 So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when
    Queen Guinever of Britain was a little wench, as touching the hit
    it.
 [Singing]
            Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
            Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

  BOYET.
 A mark marvellous well shot; for they both did hit it.

  COSTARD.
 She's too hard for you at pricks, sir; challenge her to
    bowl.

  HOLOFERNES.
 The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
    And raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.

  NATHANIEL.
 I Will something affect the letter, for it argues
    facility.

  
    The preyful Princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing
      pricket.
 A rare talent!
  DULL.
 But the gift is good in
    those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.

  HOLOFERNES.
 Ah, good old Mantuan! I may speak of thee as
    the traveller doth of Venice:
                   Venetia, Venetia,
                   Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia.

    Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not,
    loves thee not-
                      Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.

  NATHANIEL.

    If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;  
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
    All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
    Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.
 I will overglance the superscript: 'To the snow-white
    hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.

  JAQUENETTA.
 Good Costard, go with me.
 Sir, God save your life!
  COSTARD.
 Have with thee, my girl.
 Marvellous well for the pen.

  NATHANIEL.

    [To DULL] Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not say me nay:
    pauca verba.
                                       Exeunt




SCENE III.

The park

Enter BEROWNE, with a paper his band, alone

  BEROWNE.
 The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
 By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep.
 Well proved again o' my side.
 I' faith, I will not.
 Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in.
 Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!
                                            [Climbs into a tree]  

                      Enter the KING, with a paper

  KING.

      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.
 Who is he comes here?
                                                   [Steps aside]

                  Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper

    What, Longaville, and reading! Listen, car.

  BEROWNE.
          [He reads the sonnet]
      'Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
      'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
      Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
      Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.

      A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
      Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
      My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
      Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
 'All hid, all hid'- an old infant play.
 O most divine Kate!
  BEROWNE.
 By earth, she is not, corporal: there you lie.
good Lord!
  BEROWNE.
 I would forget her; but a fever she
    Reigns in my blood, and will rememb'red be.

        Do not call it sin in me
        That I am forsworn for thee;
        Thou for whom Jove would swear
        Juno but an Ethiope were;
        And deny himself for Jove,
        Turning mortal for thy love.

    O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville,
    Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
    Would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note;
    For none offend where all alike do dote.
 'O Jove!' the other cries.

    What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
    Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?  
    How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!
    How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
    For all the wealth that ever I did see,
    I would not have him know so much by me.


                 Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD

  JAQUENETTA.
 God bless the King!
  KING.
 Some certain treason.
 Berowne, read it over.

  KING.
 It is Berowne's writing, and here is his name.

                                       [Gathering up the pieces]
  BEROWNE.
 Now the number is even.

  BEROWNE.

  KING.
 What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
  BEROWNE.
  
  BEROWNE.

  BEROWNE.

  LONGAVILLE.
 And since her time are colliers counted bright.
 Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

  BEROWNE.
 Your mistresses dare never come in rain
    For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

  KING.

                                              [Showing his shoe]
  BEROWNE.

  KING.
 Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

  BEROWNE.

    For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
    Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
    Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
    As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair.

    Never durst poet touch a pen to write
    Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;
    O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,  
    And plant in tyrants mild humility.

    They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
    They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,
    Else none at all in aught proves excellent.

    For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;
    Or for Love's sake, a word that loves all men;
    Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;
    Or women's sake, by whom we men are men-
    Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.

    It is religion to be thus forsworn;
    For charity itself fulfils the law,
    And who can sever love from charity?
  KING.
 Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
  BEROWNE.
 Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
    Pell-mell, down with them! be first advis'd,  
    In conflict, that you get the sun of them.

ACT V.
 SCENE I.

  NATHANIEL.

    He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur
    'nebour'; 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne.

  NATHANIEL.
 Quare 'chirrah,' not 'sirrah'?
  ARMADO.

  HOLOFERNES.
 [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast of
    languages and stol'n the scraps.
  
  COSTARD.

  MOTH.
 Quis, quis, thou consonant?
  MOTH.

  MOTH.
 Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your
    infamy circum circa- a gig of a cuckold's horn.
 O, I smell false Latin; 'dunghill' for unguem.
 Or mons, the hill.

  ARMADO.

  ARMADO.
 Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant
    gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
    limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.
 An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may
    cry 'Well done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is
    the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to
    do it.

  DULL.
 Nor understood none neither, sir.

  HOLOFERNES.

                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
 Madam, came nothing else along with that?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 That was the way to make his godhead wax;
    For he hath been five thousand year a boy.

  ROSALINE.
 A light condition in a beauty dark.
 We need more light to find your meaning out.

  ROSALINE.

  KATHARINE.
 Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
 Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.

    An if my face were but as fair as yours,
    My favour were as great: be witness this.

  KATHARINE.
 Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE.
 I think no less.
 We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

    That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 The blood of youth burns not with such excess  
    As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

    Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
    That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage.

    With that they all did tumble on the ground,
    With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
    To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.
 But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
 But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
 True; out indeed.
 Once to behold, rogue.

  MOTH.
 They will not answer to that epithet;
    You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.

                                                       Exit MOTH
  ROSALINE.
 What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE.
 What would they, say they?  
  BOYET.

  ROSALINE.

  BEROWNE.
 We number nothing that we spend for you;
    Our duty is so rich, so infinite,  
    That we may do it still without accompt.

  ROSALINE.
 Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.

  KING.
 Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE.
 You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
 Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.

  ROSALINE.
 We will not dance.

  ROSALINE.

  KING.
 Price you yourselves.
 That can never be.

  BEROWNE.
 Seventh sweet, adieu!  
    Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Gall! bitter.
                 [They converse apart]
  DUMAIN.

  LONGAVILLE.

  KATHARINE.
  
                             Exeunt KING, LORDS, and BLACKAMOORS
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
    Will they not, think you, hang themselves to-night?
    Or ever but in vizards show their faces?
    This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite.

  ROSALINE.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
 Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
    And trow you what he call'd me?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Qualm, perhaps.
 Yes, in good faith.
 Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE.

  MARIA.
 Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.
 Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
  BOYET.
 That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
 I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
 See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
    Till this man show'd thee? And what art thou now?
  KING.
 All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 How, madam! Russians!
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 This jest is dry to me.
 I am a fool, and full of poverty.

  ROSALINE.
 We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.

    Can any face of brass hold longer out?
    Here stand I, lady- dart thy skill at me,
    Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,
    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,
    Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
    And I will wish thee never more to dance,
    Nor never more in Russian habit wait.

    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
    Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,
    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.

  BEROWNE.

    These lords are visited; you are not free,
    For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
 Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
 Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

  BEROWNE.

    Were not you here but even now, disguis'd?
  KING.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  KING.
 By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
    You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.

    What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
 BEROWNE.
 Neither of either; I remit both twain.

    Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
    We are again forsworn in will and error.
 O Lord, sir, they would know
     Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no?
  BEROWNE.
 Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
    I hope it is not so.
 Is not nine.

  BEROWNE.
 Art thou one of the Worthies?
  COSTARD.
 Go, bid them prepare.

  COSTARD.
 Berowne, they will shame us; let them not approach.
 We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
    To have one show worse than the King's and his company.
 I say they shall not come.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  BEROWNE.
 'A speaks not like a man of God his making.

  BEROWNE.
 There is five in the first show.

  BEROWNE.
 The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
 You lie, you are not he.
 I Pompey am-
  BOYET.

  BEROWNE.
 My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
 When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
    By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might.
 Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.
 Proceed, good
    Alexander.
 When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-
  BOYET.
 Your servant, and Costard.

  COSTARD.
 Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
 I will not be put out of countenance.

  HOLOFERNES.

  DUMAIN.

  BEROWNE.

  LONGAVILLE.
  
    And so adieu, sweet Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay?
  DUMAIN.

  DUMAIN.

  KING.
 But is this Hector?
  DUMAIN.
 His leg is too big for Hector's.
  
  ARMADO.
 The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
    Gave Hector a gift-
  DUMAIN.

  DUMAIN.
 No, cloven.
 That columbine.
 Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.

  DUMAIN.
 Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.

  COSTARD.

  BEROWNE.
 Room for the incensed Worthies!
  COSTARD.
 Do you not see
    Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You will lose
    your reputation.
 Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
    shirt.
 The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
    for penance.
 God save you, madam!
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.
 Madam, not so; I do beseech you stay.
 Farewell, worthy lord.

    And though the mourning brow of progeny
    Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
    The holy suit which fain it would convince,
    Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
    Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
    From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost
    Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
    As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
 We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
    Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
    And, in our maiden council, rated them
    At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
    As bombast and as lining to the time;
    But more devout than this in our respects  
    Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
    In their own fashion, like a merriment.
 Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
    Grant us your loves.

  PRINCESS OF FRANCE.

  KING.
 I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
 Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
    Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
    Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
    Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
    Which you on all estates will execute
    That lie within the mercy of your wit.
 Was not that not Hector?
  DUMAIN.
 I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave.
 I am a
    votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her
    sweet love three year.
 But, most esteemed greatness, will you
    hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in
    praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo? It should have followed in the
    end of our show.

  ARMADO.


         When all aloud the wind doth blow,
         And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
         And birds sit brooding in the snow,
         And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
         When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,  
         Then nightly sings the staring owl:
              'Tu-who;
         Tu-whit, To-who'- A merry note,
         While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

  THIRD WITCH.
 That will be ere the set of sun.
 Where the place?
  SECOND WITCH.
 Upon the heath.

  FIRST WITCH.
 What bloody man is that? He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.

  MALCOLM.

    If I say sooth, I must report they were
    As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
    So they
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.

                                        Exit Sergeant, attended.

  DUNCAN.
 Great happiness!
  ROSS.
 Go pronounce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.
 I'll see it done.

  DUNCAN.

A heath.
 Thunder.

    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
 Thou'rt kind.
 And I another.
 Show me, show me.
 A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.
  

                 Enter Macbeth and Banquo.

  BANQUO.
 You should be women,
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
    That you are so.
 All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
  THIRD WITCH.
 Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
    Are ye fantastical or that indeed  
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
    You greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal.
 Hail!
  FIRST WITCH.

    By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor.
 Were such things here as we do speak about?
    Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?
  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.
 And Thane of Cawdor too.

  MACBETH.

    [Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
    When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?
  BANQUO.

    [Aside.
 [Aside.
] If chance will have me King, why, chance may
      crown me
    Without my stir.
 Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

  BANQUO.
 Come, friends.





SCENE IV.
 Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and Attendants.
 Nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death,
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed
    As 'twere a careless trifle.
 The service and the loyalty lowe,
    In doing it, pays itself.

  DUNCAN.

  DUNCAN.
 Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    And you whose places are the nearest, know
    We will establish our estate upon
    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
    The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
    Not unaccompanied invest him only,
    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
    On all deservers.
 The rest is labor, which is not used for you.

  DUNCAN.
 Let's after him,
    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
 The King comes here tonight.
                        Exit Messenger.
 My dearest love,
    Duncan comes here tonight.

  MACBETH.
                            Exeunt.





SCENE VI.


  DUNCAN.
 This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.
 No jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.


  DUNCAN.
 Herein I teach you
    How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains,
    And thank us for your trouble.
 Fair and noble hostess,
    We are your guest tonight.
 We love him highly,
    And shall continue our graces towards him.
                              Exeunt.





SCENE VII
Macbeth's castle.


Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who pass over
the stage.
  Then enter Macbeth.


  MACBETH.
 Why have you left the chamber?
  MACBETH.
 We will proceed no further in this business:
    He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
    Not cast aside so soon.
 Art thou afeard
    To be the same in thine own act and valor
    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?
  MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.
 What beast wast then  
    That made you break this enterprise to me?
    When you durst do it, then you were a man,
    And, to be more than what you were, you would
    Be so much more the man.
 When Duncan is asleep-
    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
    Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
    That memory, the warder of the brain,  
    Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
    A limbeck only.
 Who dares receive it other,
    As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
    Upon his death?
  MACBETH.
 I am settled and bend up
    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.

Inverness.


Enter Banquo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him.
 Take thee that too.
 A friend.

    This diamond he greets your wife withal,
    By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
    In measureless content.

  BANQUO.
 All's well.

  MACBETH.
 If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
    It shall make honor for you.

  BANQUO.
 Good repose the while.

                                     Exeunt Banquo.

    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.

    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
    I see thee yet, in form as palpable
    As this which now I draw.

    Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going,
    And such an instrument I was to use.
 There's no such thing:
    It is the bloody business which informs
    Thus to mine eyes.

                                                   A bell rings.

    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.


Enter Lady Macbeth.
 Hark! Peace!
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good night.

  MACBETH.
 Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
    He could not miss 'em.
 Hark!
    Who lies i' the second chamber?
  LADY MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.
 I stood and heard them,
    But they did say their prayers and address'd them
    Again to sleep.
 There are two lodged together.

  MACBETH.
 But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
    I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
    Stuck in my throat.

    I am afraid to think what I have done;
    Look on't again I dare not.
 The sleeping and the dead
    Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil.


  LADY MACBETH.
] I hear knocking
    At the south entry.
] Hark, more knocking.

  MACBETH.

The same.
 Come
    in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.

                                                 Opens the gate.
 Therefore much drink may be said to be an
    equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens
    him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion,
    equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.
 That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited
    him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though  
    he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.

  LENNOX.

  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.

    This is the door.
 My young remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.


                      Re-enter Macduff.
 Mean you his Majesty?
  MACDUFF.


                     Enter Lady Macbeth.


  LADY MACBETH.

    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.
 You are, and do not know't.

   MALCOLM.

    They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
    Was to be trusted with them.
  
  MACBETH.
 O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
    That I did kill them.
 Wherefore did you so?
  MACBETH.
 Help me hence, ho!
  MACDUFF.

  BANQUO.
 Look to the lady.
 Let's briefly put on manly readiness
    And meet i' the hall together.

                           Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
  
  MALCOLM.
 Where we are
    There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,
    The nearer bloody.
 This murtherous shaft that's shot
    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
    Is to avoid the aim.
 There's warrant in that theft
    Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.





SCENE IV.

Outside Macbeth's castle.


  OLD MAN.
 Ah, good father,
    Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
    Threaten his bloody stage.

  OLD MAN.


    Here comes the good Macduff.
 Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
  MACDUFF.
 Alas, the day!
    What good could they pretend?
  MACDUFF.
 Well, may you see things well done there.

    Adieu,
    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
  ROSS.
 SCENE I.
 Here's our chief guest.

  MACBETH.
 We should have else desired your good advice,
    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
    In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.

  MACBETH.

  BANQUO.
                                       Exit Banquo.

    Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night; to make society
    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
    Till supper time alone.
 While then, God be with you!
                        Exeunt all but Macbeth and an Attendant.
 Attend those men
    Our pleasure?
  ATTENDANT.
                 Exit Attendant.
 Our fears in Banquo.


    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
 You made it known to us.
 Do you find
    Your patience so predominant in your nature,
    That you can let this go? Are you so gospel'd,
    To pray for this good man and for his issue,
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
    And beggar'd yours forever?
  FIRST MURTHERER.
 We are men, my liege.
 The valued file
    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
    According to the gift which bounteous nature
    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive
    Particular addition, from the bill
    That writes them all alike; and so of men.

  MACBETH.
 I'll call upon you straight.
 Abide within.
           Exit.
 Nought's had, all's spent,
    Where our desire is got without content.


                    Enter Macbeth.
 Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

    Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.

  MACBETH.
 So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.

    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:  
    Unsafe the while, that we
    Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,
    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
    Disguising what they are.
 You must leave this.
 But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

A park near the palace.


Enter three Murtherers.

  FIRST MURTHERER.

  THIRD MURTHERER.

  FIRST MURTHERER.

  THIRD MURTHERER.
 Almost a mile, but he does usually-  
    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.

  BANQUO.
 Fleance escapes.
 Wast not the way?
  THIRD MURTHERER.
 A banquet prepared.


  MACBETH.

  LORDS.
 Thanks to your Majesty.
 Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
    For my heart speaks they are welcome.

    Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst.

  MURTHERER.

  MACBETH.
 If thou didst it,
    Thou art the nonpareil.

  MURTHERER.
 I had else been perfect,
    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
    As broad and general as the casing air;
    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?
  MURTHERER.
 My royal lord,
    You do not give the cheer.


      The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place.

  MACBETH.
 What is't that moves your Highness?
  MACBETH.
 Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.

  LADY MACBETH.
 Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,
    And hath been from his youth.

    The fit is momentary; upon a thought
    He will again be well.

  LADY MACBETH.

    Why, so, being gone,
    I am a man again.
 Pray you sit still.

  ROSS.
 I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
 You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

    We are yet but young in deed.
 Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.
  
    Your vessels and your spells provide,
    Your charms and everything beside.

    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
    His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
 The gracious Duncan
    Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.

    And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
    For Fleance fled.
 Men must not walk too late.
 So that, I say,
    He has borne all things well; and I do think  
    That, had he Duncan's sons under his key-
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they should find
    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.

    But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd
    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,
    Macduff lives in disgrace.
 The son of Duncan,
    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
    Lives in the English court and is received
    Of the most pious Edward with such grace
    That the malevolence of fortune nothing
    Takes from his high respect.

  LENNOX.
"
  LENNOX.
 Some holy angel
    Fly to the court of England and unfold
    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
    May soon return to this our suffering country
    Under a hand accursed!
  LORD.
 I'll send my prayers with him.

 SCENE I.
 Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

  THIRD WITCH.
 Double, double, toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

    And now about the cauldron sing,
    Like elves and fairies in a ring,
    Enchanting all that you put in.
 How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
    What is't you do?
  ALL.
 A deed without a name.

  FIRST WITCH.
 Enough.
 But one word more-
  FIRST WITCH.
 Here's another,
    More potent than the first.


          Thunder.
 That will never be.
 Yet my heart
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
    Can tell so much, shall Banquo's issue ever
    Reign in this kingdom?
  ALL.


  MACBETH.
 Filthy hags!
    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
    Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more!
    And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
    Which shows me many more; and some I see
    That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
 What, is this so?
  FIRST WITCH.

    I'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round,
    That this great King may kindly say
    Our duties did his welcome pay.
 The Witches dance and
                                        then vanish with Hecate.
 No, my lord.
 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
    Macduff is fled to England.
 No boasting like a fool;
    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
  
    But no more sights! -Where are these gentlemen?
    Come, bring me where they are.





SCENE II.
 When our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.

  ROSS.
 My dearest coz,  
    I pray you, school yourself.
 I dare not speak much further;
    But cruel are the times when we are traitors
    And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
    But float upon a wild and violent sea
    Each way and move.
 My pretty cousin,
    Blessing upon you!
  LADY MACDUFF.

  ROSS.
 As birds do, Mother.
 What, with worms and flies?  
  SON.

  LADY MACDUFF.

    My father is not dead, for all your saying.
 Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i' faith,
    With wit enough for thee.

  SON.
 Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

                    Enter a Messenger.
 Heaven preserve you!  
    I dare abide no longer.
 Why then, alas,
    Do I put up that womanly defense,
    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?

                      Enter Murtherers.

                            Exit Lady Macduff, crying "Murther!"
                               Exeunt Murtherers, following her.
 Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
    Weep our sad bosoms empty.
 Let us rather
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
    Bestride our downfall'n birthdom.
 You have loved him well;
    He hath not touch'd you yet.

  MALCOLM.
 Be not offended;
    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.

  MACDUFF.
 But there's no bottom, none,
    In my voluptuousness.
 Your wives, your daughters,
    Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
    The cestern of my lust, and my desire
    All continent impediments would o'erbear
    That did oppose my will.
 Yet do not fear;
    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
    Of your mere own.
 All these are portable,
    With other graces weigh'd.
 But I have none.
 O nation miserable!  
    With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
    Since that the truest issue of thy throne
    By his own interdiction stands accursed
    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
    Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,
    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
    Died every day she lived.
 Devilish Macbeth
    By many of these trains hath sought to win me
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
    From over-credulous haste.
 But God above
    Deal between thee and me! For even now
    I put myself to thy direction and  
    Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
    For strangers to my nature.
 What's the disease he means?
  MALCOLM.
 How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction.

  MACDUFF.
 The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
  ROSS.

    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland  
    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
    To doff their dire distresses.

  ROSS.

  MACDUFF.
 Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,  
    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
    That ever yet they heard.
 Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
    Savagely slaughter'd.
 To relate the manner
    Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer,
    To add the death of you.
 The grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.
 Wife, children, servants, all
    That could be found.
 I have said.

    Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
    To cure this deadly grief.
 He has no children.
 Dispute it like a man.
 I shall do so,
    But I must also feel it as a man.

    Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,
    Our lack is nothing but our leave.

 Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her
    rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her
    closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it,
    afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while
    in a most fast sleep.


                Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
 Why, it stood by her.
 She has light by her
     continually; 'tis her command.

  GENTLEWOMAN.

  GENTLEWOMAN.
 It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
    washing her hands.

  LADY MACBETH.

  LADY MACBETH.

  DOCTOR.
 Come,
    come, come, come, give me your hand.
What's done cannot be undone.
 Unnatural deeds
    Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds
    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.

                                                         Exeunt.

The country near Dunsinane.
 Drum and colors.
 Near Birnam Wood
    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
 There is Seward's son
    And many unrough youths that even now
    Protest their first of manhood.

    Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,
    Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,
    He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause  
    Within the belt of rule.
 Now does he feel
    His secret murthers sticking on his hands,
    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
    Those he commands move only in command,
    Nothing in love.
 Well, march we on
    To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.

    Make we our march towards Birnam.


Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
 Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
    Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
    I cannot taint with fear.
" Then fly, false Thanes,
    And mingle with the English epicures!
    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.


    The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
    Where got'st thou that goose look?
  SERVANT.
 There is ten thousand-
  MACBETH.
 Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
    Thou lily-liver'd boy.
 I'll put it on.
 Give me mine armor.

  MACBETH.
 Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.

    Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
 Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation
    Makes us hear something.
] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
    Profit again should hardly draw me here.





SCENE IV.
 Drum and colors.
 We doubt it nothing.
 It shall be done.

  SIWARD.

  MALCOLM.

  MACDUFF.


  MACBETH.
 It is the cry of women, my good lord.

  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.
 If thou speak'st false,
    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
    Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
    I care not if thou dost for me as much.


  MALCOLM.
 Worthy Macduff and we
    Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
    According to our order.





SCENE VII.
  Before the castle.
  Alarums.


Enter Macbeth.
 What's he
    That was not born of woman? Such a one
    Am I to fear, or none.

  YOUNG SIWARD.
 No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
    Than any is in hell.
 No, nor more fearful.
              Exit.
 That way the noise is.

    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves.
 Either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,
    I sheathe again undeeded.
 We have met with foes
    That strike beside us.

  SIWARD.


Enter Macbeth.


                      Enter Macduff.

  MACDUFF.
 I have no words.

    My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
    Than terms can give thee out!                    They fight.
 I will not yield,
    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
    And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
 Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
 Ay, and brought off the field.

  SIWARD.
 Why then, God's soldier be he!
    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,  
    I would not wish them to a fairer death.
 He's worth more sorrow,
    And that I'll spend for him.


             Re-enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.
 My Thanes and kinsmen,  
    Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland
    In such an honor named.
 What's more to do,
    Which would be planted newly with the time,
    As calling home our exiled friends abroad
    That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
    Producing forth the cruel ministers
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
    Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
    Took off her life; this, and what needful else
    That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace
    We will perform in measure, time, and place.

 Look where he comes.

    Take thy commission.

  ANGELO.
 Fare you well.

A street

Enter Lucio and two other GENTLEMEN

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.

    Thou art the list.
 I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
    thy speech.
  

                        Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE

  LUCIO.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 To three thousand dolours a year.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
 Away; let's go learn the truth of it.
 Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
    with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.
 All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.

  MRS.
 They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
    a wise burgher put in for them.

  MRS.
 Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
    What shall become of me?  
  POMPEY.
 Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
 I do it not in evil disposition,
    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
 Thus can the demigod Authority
    Make us pay down for our offence by weight
    The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
    On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
  
  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 One word, good friend.

  LUCIO.
 Is lechery so look'd
    after?  
  CLAUDIO.

    You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
    Save that we do the denunciation lack
    Of outward order; this we came not to,
    Only for propagation of a dow'r
    Remaining in the coffer of her friends.
 With child, perhaps?
  CLAUDIO.

    Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.
 I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
    which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the
    enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus
    foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack.
 I'll to her.

  LUCIO.

  FRIAR.

    I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
    A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
    My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
    And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
    For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
    And so it is received.
 Gladly, my lord.
 Now, as fond fathers,
    Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
    Only to stick it in their children's sight
    For terror, not to use, in time the rod
    Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
    Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
    And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
    The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
    Goes all decorum.

  DUKE.
 Hence shall we see,
    If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

    He calls again; I pray you answer him.
 Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.

  ISABELLA.
 Woe me! For what?
  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 Is she your cousin?
  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.
 All hope is gone,
    Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
    To soften Angelo.

  ISABELLA.
 Doth he so seek his life?
  LUCIO.
 Has censur'd him
    Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath
    A warrant for his execution.

  ISABELLA.
 Alas! what poor ability's in me
    To do him good?
  LUCIO.
 Assay the pow'r you have.

  ISABELLA.

  LUCIO.
 Be it as your wisdom will.


         Enter ELBOW and OFFICERS with FROTH and POMPEY

  ELBOW.
 What are you, sir?
  ELBOW.
 How! thy wife!
  ELBOW.

  ESCALUS.

  ESCALUS.

  ESCALUS.

  POMPEY.
 No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
    right; but to the point.
 Ay, so I did indeed.
 Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
    that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
    wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-
  FROTH.
 And,
    I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of
    fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not  
    at Hallowmas, Master Froth?
  FROTH.
 This will last out a night in Russia,
    When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,
    And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
    Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
 I think no less.
 I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

  POMPEY.
 I beseech your honour, ask me.
 Good
    Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose.
 Well, I do so.
 He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
  ELBOW.
 By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
    any of us all.
 Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
    I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.
 Marry, I thank your good worship for it.
 Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth.
 I thank your worship.

  ESCALUS.
 Pompey.
 Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
    the city?
  ESCALUS.
 If
    your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you
    need not to fear the bawds.
 If you live to see this come
    to pass, say Pompey told you so.

  POMPEY.
 I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I
    shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
 How long have you been in this place of constable?
  ELBOW.
 I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
    continued in it some time.
 Are there not men in your ward
    sufficient to serve it?
  ELBOW.
 I pray you home to dinner with me.

    But yet, poor Claudio! There is no remedy.

    Do you your office, or give up your place,
    And you shall well be spar'd.

  PROVOST.

    What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
    She's very near her hour.
 Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
 [Going] Save your honour!
  ANGELO.
 Stay a little while.
 I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
    Please but your honour hear me.

  ANGELO.
 Well; what's your suit?
  ISABELLA.
 There is a vice that most I do abhor,
    And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
    For which I would not plead, but that I must;
    For which I must not plead, but that I am
    At war 'twixt will and will not.

  ANGELO.
 [To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
    Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
    You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
    You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
 Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.

    And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
 I will not do't.
 Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

  ISABELLA.
 Be you content, fair maid.

    It is the law, not I condemn your brother.

    He's not prepar'd for death.
 But man, proud man,
    Dress'd in a little brief authority,
    Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
    As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,
    Would all themselves laugh mortal.

  PROVOST.

  LUCIO.
 [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
    Such sense that my sense breeds with it.

  LUCIO.

  ISABELLA.
 Never could the strumpet,
    With all her double vigour, art and nature,
    Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
    Subdues me quite.

A prison

Enter, severally, DUKE, disguised as a FRIAR, and PROVOST

  DUKE.
 Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
 I am the Provost.
 Bound by my charity and my blest order,
    I come to visit the afflicted spirits
    Here in the prison.
 I'll gladly learn.
 Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

  JULIET.

  DUKE.
 There rest.
  

                           Enter SERVANT

    How now, who's there?
  SERVANT.

  ANGELO.
 [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.


                            Enter ISABELLA
  
    How now, fair maid?
  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.

  ANGELO.
 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
 How say you?
  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.
 And 'twere the cheaper way:
    Better it were a brother died at once
    Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
    Should die for ever.
 We are all frail.

    I do arrest your words.

  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.

    Sign me a present pardon for my brother
    Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud
    What man thou art.
 Who will believe thee, Isabel?
    My unsoil'd name, th' austereness of my life,
    My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,
    Will so your accusation overweigh
    That you shall stifle in your own report,
    And smell of calumny.
 Answer me to-morrow,
    Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
    I'll prove a tyrant to him.

    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.

    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

ACT III.
 SCENE I.
 The miserable have no other medicine
    But only hope:
    I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.

  DUKE.
 Thou 'rt by no means valiant;
    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
    Of a poor worm.
 Friend hast thou none;
    For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
    For ending thee no sooner.
 I humbly thank you.
 Let it come on.

  ISABELLA.

  DUKE.

  CLAUDIO.


                        Enter ISABELLA

  ISABELLA.
 Look, signior, here's your sister.
 Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
 But in what nature?
  ISABELLA.
 In such a one as, you consenting to't,
    Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
    And leave you naked.

  CLAUDIO.
 O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
    And six or seven winters more respect
    Than a perpetual honour.
 There spake my brother; there my father's grave
    Did utter forth a voice.
 This night's the time
    That I should do what I abhor to name,
    Or else thou diest to-morrow.
 Thou shalt not do't.
 O, were it but my life!  
    I'd throw it down for your deliverance
    As frankly as a pin.

  ISABELLA.

  CLAUDIO.
 Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
    To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
    This sensible warm motion to become
    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
    To bathe in fiery floods or to reside  
    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    And blown with restless violence round about
    The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
    Of those that lawless and incertain thought
    Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.

  ISABELLA.
 O you beast!
    O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
    Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
    Is't not a kind of incest to take life
    From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?  
    Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
    For such a warped slip of wilderness
    Ne'er issu'd from his blood.

    I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
    No word to save thee.

  CLAUDIO.
 Hold you there.
 What's your will, father?
  DUKE.
 In good time.
 Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

  DUKE.
 She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
    oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the
    contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
    wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
    sister.

  ISABELLA.
 It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
    not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
    doing it.
 If you think well to carry this as you may, the
    doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.

                                                Exeunt severally




Scene II.

The street before the prison

Enter, on one side, DUKE disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW,
and OFFICERS with POMPEY

  ELBOW.
 Bless you, good father friar.
 Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!  
    The evil that thou causest to be done,
    That is thy means to live.
 Take him to prison, officer;
    Correction and instruction must both work
    Ere this rude beast will profit.

  ELBOW.
 His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
  

                          Enter LUCIO

  POMPEY.
 Here's a gentleman, and a friend
    of mine.
 How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
    thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,
    newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the
    pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st
    thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'
    last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,
    man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
    trick of it?
  DUKE.
 Yes, faith, sir.
 Farewell; go, say I sent thee
    thither.
 For debt, Pompey- or how?
  ELBOW.

  LUCIO.

  POMPEY.

  LUCIO.

    Bless you, friar.
 And you.

  LUCIO.
 Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
  ELBOW.

  LUCIO.
 Can you tell me of any?
  LUCIO.
 It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
    state and usurp the beggary he was never born to.
 Lord Angelo
    dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.
 Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
    of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that
    is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the
    getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
    thousand.
 He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,
    and that instructed him to mercy.
 O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
 The Duke had crotchets in  
    him.

  DUKE.
 Sir, I was an inward of his.

  DUKE.
 Therefore you
    speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much
    dark'ned in your malice.
 Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 I'll be hang'd first.

    Farewell.
 No might nor greatness in mortality
    Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny
    The whitest virtue strikes.
 Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is
    accounted a merciful man; good my lord.
 His child is a year and a quarter old
    come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and see how he goes
    about to abuse me.
 If my brother
    wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.

  DUKE.
 Not of this country, though my chance is now
    To use it for my time.
 I am a brother  
    Of gracious order, late come from the See
    In special business from his Holiness.
 Novelty is only in request; and,
    as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
    virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing.
 Much upon this riddle runs the
    wisdom of the world.
 Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
    anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all
    temperance.
  
  DUKE.
 I have labour'd for the poor
    gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother
    justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him
    he is indeed Justice.

  DUKE.


                  Enter DUKE, disguised as before

  MARIANA.

    I pray you tell me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to-day.
 Much
    upon this time have I promis'd here to meet.
                        Exit
  DUKE.
  

                       Re-enter MARIANA

    I pray you be acquainted with this maid;
    She comes to do you good.
 Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

  MARIANA.
 Will't please you walk aside?
                                     Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA
  DUKE.
 O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes
    Are stuck upon thee.
  

                 Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA

    Welcome, how agreed?
  ISABELLA.

  ISABELLA.
 Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.

    To bring you thus together 'tis no sin,
    Sith that the justice of your title to him
    Doth flourish the deceit.
 Come, let us go;
    Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
 Can you cut off a man's head?
  POMPEY.
 He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath
    been a bawd.

  PROVOST.
 Pray, sir, by your good favour- for surely, sir, a good
    favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call,
    sir, your occupation a mystery?
  ABHORSON.
 Ay, sir; a mystery.

  POMPEY.


                 Enter DUKE, disguised as before

    Welcome, father.
  
  DUKE.
 Not Isabel?
  PROVOST.

  PROVOST.
 Were he meal'd with that
    Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
    But this being so, he's just.
 Happily
    You something know; yet I believe there comes
    No countermand; no such example have we.

    Besides, upon the very siege of justice,
    Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
    Profess'd the contrary.


                         Enter a MESSENGER  
    This is his lordship's man.
                      Exit MESSENGER
  DUKE.

    When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
    That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
 What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'
    afternoon?
  PROVOST.

  DUKE.
 How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him
    to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his
    manner to do so.
 His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,
    his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
    an undoubted proof.
 Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
 He hath evermore had the liberty of the
    prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many
    times a day, if not many days entirely drunk.

  DUKE.
 There is written in your brow, Provost,
    honesty and constancy.

  DUKE.
 By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions
    may be your guide.
 Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
    and his head borne to Angelo.
 Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
 If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
    good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
    it with my life.

  PROVOST.
 This is a thing that Angelo knows
    not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
    perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
    monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ.
 Call your executioner, and off with
    Barnardine's head.
'
  
                            Enter ABHORSON

  ABHORSON.
 You must be so good, sir,
    to rise and be put to death.
 [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.

  POMPEY.
 He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
 Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?  
  POMPEY.

    Do we jest now, think you?
  DUKE.

  DUKE.
 O, Sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you
    Look forward on the journey you shall go.
 O gravel heart!
    After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

    Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
    To the under generation, you shall find
    Your safety manifested.


                         Re-enter PROVOST

  PROVOST.
                             Exit  
  ISABELLA.
 She's come to know
    If yet her brother's pardon be come hither;
    But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
    To make her heavenly comforts of despair
    When it is least expected.

  DUKE.
 Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
    Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!
  DUKE.

  ISABELLA.
 Her cause and yours
    I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
    Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home.

  LUCIO.
 Thou must be patient.
 If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had  
    lived.
 Well, you'll answer this one day.
 Fare ye well.

  DUKE.
 Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would
    else have married me to the rotten medlar.
 Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other.
 And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
    ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should
    exhibit their petitions in the street?
  ESCALUS.
 He should have liv'd,
    Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
    Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
    By so receiving a dishonour'd life
    With ransom of such shame.
         Exit




SCENE V.
                  Exit FRIAR

                             Enter VARRIUS

  DUKE.
 There's other of our friends
    Will greet us here anon.
 To speak so indirectly I am loath;
    I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
    That is your part.
 I would Friar Peter-

                         Enter FRIAR PETER

  ISABELLA.

  PETER.
 Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
    Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
    He shall not pass you.
 Twice have the trumpets sounded;  
    The generous and gravest citizens
    Have hent the gates, and very near upon
    The Duke is ent'ring; therefore, hence, away.

 My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
    Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

  ANGELO.

  ISABELLA.
 Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
    Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid!
    O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye
    By throwing it on any other object
    Till you have heard me in my true complaint,
    And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.

  DUKE.
 Hear me, O, hear me, here!
  ANGELO.
 By course of justice!
  ANGELO.

    That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
    That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
    That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
    An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
    Is it not strange and strange?
  DUKE.
 It is not truer he is Angelo
    Than this is all as true as it is strange;
    Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
    To th' end of reck'ning.
 Believe it, royal Prince,
    If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
    Had I more name for badness.
 I am the sister of one Claudio,
    Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
    To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.

  ISABELLA.

  DUKE.
 You were not bid to speak.

  DUKE.
 I wish you now, then;
    Pray you take note of it; and when you have
    A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
    Be perfect.

  LUCIO.
 This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.

  ISABELLA.
 In brief- to set the needless process by,
    How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
    How he refell'd me, and how I replied,
    For this was of much length- the vile conclusion
    I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
    He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
    To his concupiscible intemperate lust,  
    Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
    My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
    And I did yield to him.
 This is most likely!
  ISABELLA.

    Who knew of your intent and coming hither?
  ISABELLA.
 One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
 A ghostly father, belike.
 A widow, then?
  MARIANA.
 Neither, my lord.
 My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither
    maid, widow, nor wife.

  DUKE.
 Well, my lord.

    I have known my husband; yet my husband
    Knows not that ever he knew me.
  
  MARIANA.
 Not that I know.

  DUKE.
 Sirrah, no more.

  LUCIO.
 I did but smile till now.

    Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
    My patience here is touch'd.
 Let me have way, my lord,
    To find this practice out.

    Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
    Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
    Though they would swear down each particular saint,
    Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
    That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
    Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains  
    To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.

  DUKE.
 I for a while will leave you;
    But stir not you till you have well determin'd
    Upon these slanderers.
 My lord, we'll do it throughly.
             Exit DUKE
    Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be
    a dishonest person?
  LUCIO.

  LUCIO.
 Not better than he, by her own report.
 Say you?
  LUCIO.
 Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
    sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.
 I will go darkly to work with her.
 Respect to your great place! and let the devil
    Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
    Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.

  ESCALUS.
 Boldly, at least.
 Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
    Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
    To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
    And in the witness of his proper ear,
    To call him villain; and then to glance from him
    To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
    Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you
    Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.

    What, 'unjust'!
  DUKE.
 Be not so hot; the Duke
    Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
    Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,
    Nor here provincial.
  
  ESCALUS.
 What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
    Is this the man that you did tell us of?
  LUCIO.
 'Tis he, my lord.
 Come hither, good-man bald-pate.
 I met you at
    the prison, in the absence of the Duke.

  ANGELO.
 Away with those giglets
    too, and with the other confederate companion!
                            [The PROVOST lays bands on the DUKE]
  DUKE.

  ANGELO.
 Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
    bald-pated lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your
    knave's visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face,
    and be hang'd an hour! Will't not off?
             [Pulls off the FRIAR'S bood and discovers the DUKE]
  DUKE.
 This may prove worse than hanging.
 Come hither, Mariana.
 Go, take her hence and marry her instantly.

    Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
    Return him here again.
 Go with him, Provost.

  DUKE.
  
    Your friar is now your prince.


       Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST

  DUKE.

  DUKE.

  MARIANA.
 You do but lose your labour.
 O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
    Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
    I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
 Against all sense you do importune her.

    They say best men moulded out of faults;
    And, for the most, become much more the better
    For being a little bad; so may my husband.
 He dies for Claudio's death.
 [Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
    Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
    As if my brother liv'd.
 Merely, my lord.

  DUKE.
 I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.

  ANGELO.
 This, my lord.

  DUKE.

    Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,  
    That apprehends no further than this world,
    And squar'st thy life according.
 Thou'rt condemn'd;
    But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
    And pray thee take this mercy to provide
    For better times to come.
 What muffl'd fellow's that?
  PROVOST.
    [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]
  DUKE.

    By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
    Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.

    Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  
  LUCIO.

    Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;
    We shall employ thee in a worthier place.

    Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
    The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
    Th' offence pardons itself.

                                                          Exeunt

 SCENE I.
 In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
 Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
    The better part of my affections would
    Be with my hopes abroad.
 My wind, cooling my broth,
    Would blow me to an ague when I thought
    What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
 Should I go to church
    And see the holy edifice of stone,
    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
    Which, touching but my gentle vessel's side,
    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
    And, in a word, but even now worth this,
    And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought  
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
    That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad?
    But tell not me; I know Antonio
    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
 Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
    Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy
    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
    Because you are not sad.

    You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?
  SALERIO.

    Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.

    Come, good Lorenzo.

    I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
    For Gratiano never lets me speak.
 His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
    in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find
    them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.
 Well; tell me now what lady is the same
    To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
    That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
  BASSANIO.
 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
    How much I have disabled mine estate
    By something showing a more swelling port
    Than my faint means would grant continuance;
    Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
    From such a noble rate; but my chief care
    Is to come fairly off from the great debts
    Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
    Hath left me gag'd.

  ANTONIO.

  BASSANIO.

    I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,
    That which I owe is lost; but if you please
    To shoot another arrow that self way
    Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
    As I will watch the aim, or to find both,  
    Or bring your latter hazard back again
    And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

    Then do but say to me what I should do
    That in your knowledge may by me be done,
    And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.
 In Belmont is a lady richly left,
    And she is fair and, fairer than that word,
    Of wondrous virtues.
 By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
    great world.
 It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be
    seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but
    competency lives longer.
 If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
    chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes'
    palaces.
 The brain may devise
    laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree;
    such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good  
    counsel the cripple.
 Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
    have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath
    devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof
    who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be
    chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love.
 I had rather be married
    to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of
    these.
 God defend me from these two!
  NERISSA.
 If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he
    love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
 What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
  PORTIA.
 That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
    a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him
    again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety,
    and seal'd under for another.
 Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
    vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk.
 When he is best, he is
    a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little
    better than a beast.

  NERISSA.
 You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
    they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is
    indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more
    suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's
    imposition, depending on the caskets.
 If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
    Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will.
 True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
    look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
  
  PORTIA.
 I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
    praise.

  PORTIA.
                                               Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Three thousand ducats- well.

  BASSANIO.
 Antonio shall become bound- well.
 Be assur'd you may.
 I am debating of my present store,
    And, by the near guess of my memory,
    I cannot instantly raise up the gross
    Of full three thousand ducats.
 What of that?
    Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
    Will furnish me.
 But soft! how many months
    Do you desire?  [To ANTONIO]  Rest you fair, good signior;
    Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

  ANTONIO.

  ANTONIO.

  SHYLOCK.
 When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
    This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
    As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
    The third possessor; ay, he was the third-
  ANTONIO.

    This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
    And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
 This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
    A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
    But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.

    But note me, signior.
 Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
' You say so-
    You that did void your rheum upon my beard
    And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
    Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.

  SHYLOCK.

  BASSANIO.

  ANTONIO.

  BASSANIO.
 Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

  BASSANIO.

  ANTONIO.

    But, if my father had not scanted me,
    And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself
    His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
    Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair
    As any comer I have look'd on yet
    For my affection.

    Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
    To try my fortune.
 But, alas the while!
    If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
    Which is the better man, the greater throw
    May turn by fortune from the weaker band.

  PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
 Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
 Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew.
  [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten father,
    who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

    I will try confusions with him.

  GOBBO.
 Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
    Master Launcelot.
 Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.

  LAUNCELOT.

  GOBBO.
 Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
    very prop.

  LAUNCELOT.
 Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
    prop? Do you know me, father?
  GOBBO.
 Give me your blessing;
    truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
    may, but in the end truth will out.
  
  GOBBO.
 I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
    Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my
    mother.

  GOBBO.
 Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
    sir, as my father shall specify-
  GOBBO.
 He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT.
 His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
    scarce cater-cousins-  
  LAUNCELOT.
 Serve you, sir.

  GOBBO.
 Thou speak'st it well.
  
    Take leave of thy old master, and inquire
    My lodging out.
  [To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery
    More guarded than his fellows'; see it done.
 Father, in.
 I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
    tongue in my head!  [Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man in
    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune.

    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes.
 Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.
 I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
 You have obtain'd it.
 No, that were pity;
    I would entreat you rather to put on
    Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
    That purpose merriment.

    And so farewell.
 I would not have my father
    See me in talk with thee.
 A street

Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO

  LORENZO.

  LORENZO.

  SALERIO.
 'Tis good we do so.

  SHYLOCK.
 And they have conspired together; I will not say you
    shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing
    that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock
    i' th' morning, falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four
    year, in th' afternoon.
 I will go before, sir.
 His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.

  SHYLOCK.

    Fast bind, fast find-  
    A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
 His hour is almost past.
 O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
    To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont
    To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
  GRATIANO.
 That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
    With that keen appetite that he sits down?
    Where is the horse that doth untread again
    His tedious measures with the unbated fire
    That he did pace them first? All things that are
    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.
 Ho! who's within?

           Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes

  JESSICA.

  JESSICA.

  JESSICA.
 Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.

    But come at once,
    For the close night doth play the runaway,
    And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

  JESSICA.


                     Enter JESSICA, below

    What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away;
    Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
 The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
    If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

  PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
 Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
    I will survey th' inscriptions back again.
'
    Why, that's the lady! All the world desires her;
    From the four corners of the earth they come
    To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint.

    The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
    Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
    For princes to come view fair Portia.

    The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
    Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
    To stop the foreign spirits, but they come
    As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.

         'All that glisters is not gold,
         Often have you heard that told;
         Many a man his life hath sold
         But my outside to behold.
               Exeunt




SCENE VIII.

  SALERIO.
 Marry, well rememb'red;
    I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
    The French and English, there miscarried
    A vessel of our country richly fraught.

    I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
  
    Bassanio told him he would make some speed
    Of his return.
 Do we so.

Belmont.
 Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
    The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
    And comes to his election presently.

  ARRAGON.

    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
'
    You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
'
    And well said too; for who shall go about
    To cozen fortune, and be honourable
    Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
    To wear an undeserved dignity.
'
    I will assume desert.
 To offend and judge are distinct offices
    And of opposed natures.

  ARRAGON.

         With one fool's head I came to woo,
         But I go away with two.

         Sweet, adieu! I'll keep my oath,
         Patiently to bear my wroth.
 Where is my lady?

 Now, what news on the Rialto?
  SALERIO.
 Come, the full stop.

  SOLANIO.
 Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
    ship.
 That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
    the wings she flew withal.
 She is damn'd for it.
 My own flesh and blood to rebel!
  SOLANIO.
 Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
  SHYLOCK.
 Let him look to his bond.
 He was wont
    to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.
 What's that good for?
  SHYLOCK.
 To bait fish withal.
 And what's his reason? I am a Jew.
 If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge.


                    Enter a MAN from ANTONIO

  MAN.
 Why,
    thou- loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to
    find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill luck
    stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my
    breathing; no tears but o' my shedding!
  TUBAL.
 Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold
    again.
 There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
    Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.

  TUBAL.

  SHYLOCK.
 Go, Tubal, fee me an
    officer; bespeak him a fortnight before.
 Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go,
    good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
 I pray you tarry; pause a day or two
    Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
    I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.

    There's something tells me- but it is not love-
    I would not lose you; and you know yourself
    Hate counsels not in such a quality.
 Let me choose;
    For as I am, I live upon the rack.

  BASSANIO.
 None but that ugly treason of mistrust
    Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love;
    There may as well be amity and life
    'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
 Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
    Where men enforced do speak anything.
 That the comparison
    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
    And wat'ry death-bed for him.
 Look on beauty  
    And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight,
    Which therein works a miracle in nature,
    Making them lightest that wear most of it;
    So are those crisped snaky golden locks
    Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
    Upon supposed fairness often known
    To be the dowry of a second head-
    The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
 Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
    Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
    Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
    'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
    Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught,
    Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,
    And here choose I.
 But her eyes-
    How could he see to do them? Having made one,
    Methinks it should have power to steal both his,
    And leave itself unfurnish'd.
 Fair lady, by your leave;
    I come by note, to give and to receive.
 But the full sum of me
    Is sum of something which, to term in gross,
    Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd;
    Happy in this, she is not yet so old
    But she may learn; happier than this,
    She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
    Commits itself to yours to be directed,
    As from her lord, her governor, her king.
 But now I was the lord  
    Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
    Queen o'er myself; and even now, but now,
    This house, these servants, and this same myself,
    Are yours- my lord's.

  BASSANIO.
' Good joy, my lord and lady!
  GRATIANO.
 My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,
    I wish you all the joy that you can wish,
    For I am sure you can wish none from me;
    And, when your honours mean to solemnize
    The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you
    Even at that time I may be married too.
 Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
    If that the youth of my new int'rest here
    Have power to bid you welcome.
 So do I, my lord;
    They are entirely welcome.

  SALERIO.
        [BASSANIO opens the letter]
  GRATIANO.

  SALERIO.
 There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
    That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
    Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
    Could turn so much the constitution
    Of any constant man.
 The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
    The best condition'd and unwearied spirit
    In doing courtesies; and one in whom
    The ancient Roman honour more appears
    Than any that draws breath in Italy.

  PORTIA.
 What sum owes he the Jew?
  BASSANIO.
 For me, three thousand ducats.
  
  PORTIA.
 What! no more?
    Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
    Double six thousand, and then treble that,
    Before a friend of this description
    Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
 Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if
    your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.
               Exeunt




SCENE III.
 Gaoler, look to him.
 I do wonder,
    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
    To come abroad with him at his request.

  SHYLOCK.
 The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
    For the commodity that strangers have
    With us in Venice, if it be denied,
    Will much impeach the justice of the state,
    Since that the trade and profit of the city
    Consisteth of all nations.
 PORTIA'S house

Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR

  LORENZO.

  PORTIA.
 Madam, with all my heart
    I shall obey you in an fair commands.
 I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
  
  BALTHASAR.

  NERISSA.
              Exeunt




SCENE V.
 Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
    mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into
    Charybdis, your mother; well, you are gone both ways.
 I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he
    comes.
 I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you
    thus get my wife into corners.

  JESSICA.
 Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
    out; he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven,
    because I am a Jew's daughter; and he says you are no good member
    of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you
    raise the price of pork.

  LORENZO.
 I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
    can the getting up of the negro's belly; the Moor is with child
    by you, Launcelot.
 It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but  
    if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I
    took her for.

  LORENZO.

  LORENZO.
 Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
    whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a
    plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover
    the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.

 Exit  
  LORENZO.

  LORENZO.

  LORENZO.
 Well, I'll set you forth.
 I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
    A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
    Uncapable of pity, void and empty
    From any dram of mercy.

  DUKE OF VENICE.
 He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.

  SHYLOCK.

    If you deny it, let the danger light
    Upon your charter and your city's freedom.

    You'll ask me why I rather choose to have
    A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
    Three thousand ducats.
 I'll not answer that,
    But say it is my humour- is it answer'd?
    What if my house be troubled with a rat,
    And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
    To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet?
    Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
    Some that are mad if they behold a cat;
    And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose,
    Cannot contain their urine; for affection,
    Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
    Of what it likes or loathes.
 Are you answered?
  BASSANIO.
 Therefore, I do beseech you,
    Make no moe offers, use no farther means,
    But with all brief and plain conveniency
    Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
 For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
 How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
  SHYLOCK.
' So do I answer you:
    The pound of flesh which I demand of him
    Is dearly bought, 'tis mine, and I will have it.

    I stand for judgment; answer; shall I have it?
  DUKE OF VENICE.

  SALERIO.


           Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyer's clerk

  DUKE OF VENICE.
 From both, my lord.

                                             [Presents a letter]
  BASSANIO.
 No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
 O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
    And for thy life let justice be accus'd.

  CLERK.
 I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,
    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
'

      Enter PORTIA for BALTHAZAR, dressed like a Doctor of Laws

  DUKE OF VENICE.
 YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;  
    And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

    Give me your hand; come you from old Bellario?
  PORTIA.
 I did, my lord.
 I am informed throughly of the cause.
 Ay, so he says.
 I do.

  PORTIA.

  SHYLOCK.
 Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
 Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.

  SHYLOCK.

  PORTIA.
 Be merciful.
 I stay here on my bond.
 O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  PORTIA.
 Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
 Is it so nominated in the bond?
  PORTIA.
 You, merchant, have you anything to say?
  ANTONIO.

    Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you,
    For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
    Than is her custom.

    Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
    And he repents not that he pays your debt;
    For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,  
    I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
    The wish would make else an unquiet house.

    This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood:
    The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh.
 O upright judge! Mark, Jew.
 I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,  
    And let the Christian go.

  PORTIA.

    Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
    But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak'st more
    Or less than a just pound- be it but so much
    As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
    Or the division of the twentieth part
    Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn
    But in the estimation of a hair-
    Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.

  GRATIANO.

  PORTIA.

  SHYLOCK.

    It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
    If it be proved against an alien
    That by direct or indirect attempts
    He seek the life of any citizen,
    The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
    Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
    Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
    And the offender's life lies in the mercy
    Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
  
    In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
    For it appears by manifest proceeding
    That indirectly, and directly too,
    Thou hast contrived against the very life
    Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
    The danger formerly by me rehears'd.
 That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
    I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
 Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.

    [To ANTONIO]  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake.

  BASSANIO.
 This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
    I will not shame myself to give you this.

  PORTIA.

  PORTIA.
 Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
    And, when she put it on, she made me vow
    That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
 Come, Antonio.


                          Enter GRATIANO

  GRATIANO.
 Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.

  PORTIA.

  PORTIA.
 Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
                                                          Exeunt




ACT V.
 SCENE I.
 The moon shines bright.
 In such a night
    Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew,
    And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,
    And ran dismayed away.

 LORENZO.


                       Enter STEPHANO

  LORENZO.
 Stephano is my name, and I bring word
    My mistress will before the break of day  
    Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
    By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
    For happy wedlock hours.

  LORENZO.
 Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
  LORENZO.
 Who calls?
  LAUNCELOT.
 Here!
  LAUNCELOT.
 Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
    horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.

 Exit
  LORENZO.

    And draw her home with music.
  
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.


                    Enter PORTIA and NERISSA

  PORTIA.

  NERISSA.
 It is your music, madam, of the house.

    How many things by season season'd are
    To their right praise and true perfection!
    Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion,
    And would not be awak'd.

  PORTIA.

  PORTIA.

    Are they return'd?
  LORENZO.
 Madam, they are not yet;  
    But there is come a messenger before,
    To signify their coming.
 Go in, Nerissa;
    Give order to my servants that they take
    No note at all of our being absent hence;
    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
 This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
    It looks a little paler; 'tis a day
    Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

    This is the man, this is Antonio,
    To whom I am so infinitely bound.
 No more than I am well acquitted of.
  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
    In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.

  PORTIA.

    Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge,
    The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
 Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
 You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
    To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,
    A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
    And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
    And swear I lost the ring defending it.
 If I could add a lie unto a fault,
    I would deny it; but you see my finger
    Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

  BASSANIO.

  PORTIA.
 If you had known the virtue of the ring,
    Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
    Or your own honour to contain the ring,
    You would not then have parted with the ring.

    Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear  
    I never more will break an oath with thee.

  PORTIA.
 Pardon me, Bassanio,
    For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

  GRATIANO.
 Speak not so grossly.
 You are all amaz'd.
 Lorenzo here
    Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,
    And even but now return'd; I have not yet
    Enter'd my house.

  ANTONIO.
 I am dumb.
 Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
  GRATIANO.
 Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
    Unless he live until he be a man.

  BASSANIO.

  PORTIA.
 Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
    Of starved people.

  PORTIA.

  GRATIANO.
               Exeunt

  EVANS.

  EVANS.
 It is petter that friends is the sword and end it;
    and there is also another device in my prain, which
    peradventure prings goot discretions with it.
 I know the young gentlewoman; she has good
    gifts.
  
  SHALLOW.
 Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
    despise one that is false; or as I despise one that is not
    true.
 The knight Sir John is there; and, I beseech you, be
    ruled by your well-willers.
  [Within]  Who's there?

                            Enter PAGE

  EVANS.

  SHALLOW.
 Sir, I thank you.

  PAGE.
 It could not be judg'd, sir.
 You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

  EVANS.

  PAGE.


      Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL

  FALSTAFF.
 Knight, you have beaten my men, kill'd my deer,
    and broke open my lodge.

  FALSTAFF.

  SHALLOW.
 I will make a prief of it in my note-book;
    and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great
    discreetly as we can.
 Pistol!
  PISTOL.
 No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

    Word of denial in thy labras here!
    Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.
 Be avis'd, sir, and pass good humours; I will say
    'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on  
    me; that is the very note of it.
 By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
    though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
    drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
 Come, we have a
    hot venison pasty to dinner; come, gentlemen, I hope we
    shall drink down all unkindness.
 I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
    Songs and Sonnets here.
 The question is
    concerning your marriage.

  EVANS.
 I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
    would do reason.
 Will you, upon good dowry,
    marry her?
  SLENDER.
 Ay, or else I would I might be hang'd, la!

                       Re-enter ANNE PAGE

  SHALLOW.

  SLENDER.

  SLENDER.
 I bruis'd my
    shin th' other day with playing at sword and dagger with
    a master of fence-three veneys for a dish of stew'd prunes
    -and, I with my ward defending my head, he hot my shin,
    and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat  
    since.
 Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i' th'
    town?
  ANNE.
 I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at
    it as any man in England.
 I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

  SLENDER.
 Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do
    you that wrong.
 I pray you, sir.

  SLENDER.
 I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
 I have spoke; let him follow.
  [To BARDOLPH]  Let me
    see thee froth and lime.
 Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
    husband's purse; he hath a legion of angels.
 I have operations in my head which be humours of
    revenge.

    I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
 Thou art the Mars of malcontents; I second thee;
    troop on.
 Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
    faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
 And Master Slender's your master?
  SIMPLE.
  
  QUICKLY.
 No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a
    little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.

  QUICKLY.
 A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
  SIMPLE.
 Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as
    any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a
    warrener.

  QUICKLY.
 Out, alas! here comes my master.
 Run in here, good young
    man; go into this closet.
 What, John Rugby! John! what, John,
    I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt he be
    not well that he comes not home.
 Do intend vat I speak? A green-a box.

  QUICKLY.
 Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be
    mad!
  CAIUS.
 O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villainy! larron!
    [Pulling SIMPLE out]  Rugby, my rapier!
  QUICKLY.
 Good master, be content.
 He came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.

  CAIUS.
 Speak-a your tale.
 To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
    speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master,
    in the way of marriage.
  [Aside to SIMPLE]  Are you avis'd o' that? You  
    shall find it a great charge; and to be up early and down
    late; but notwithstanding-to tell you in your ear, I would
    have no words of it-my master himself is in love with
    Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know
    Anne's mind-that's neither here nor there.
 Do not you tell-a me dat I
    shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack
    priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to
    measure our weapon.
 Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well.
 Rugby, come to the court with me.


                          Enter FENTON

  FENTON.
 The better that it pleases your good worship to
    ask.
 What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?
  QUICKLY.

  FENTON.
 Have not your worship a wart above your eye?
  FENTON.
 Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
  QUICKLY.

ACT II.
 PAGE.

    You are not young, no more am I; go to, then, there's
    sympathy.
 I will not say, Pity me: 'tis not a soldier-like phrase;
    but I say, Love me.
'
    What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world!
    One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show
    himself a young gallant! What an unweighed behaviour
    hath this Flemish drunkard pick'd-with the devil's name!
    -out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner
    assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!
    What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth.
 FORD.

  MRS.
 FORD.
 O Mistress Page, give me some counsel.
 FORD.
 FORD.
  
  MRS.
 FORD.
 I'll entertain myself like
    one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he
    know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would
    never have boarded me in this fury.
 PAGE.
 Let's be reveng'd on him; let's appoint him a
    meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead
    him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn'd his
    horses to mine host of the Garter.
 You are the happier woman.
 Why, sir, my wife is not young.

  PISTOL.
 Ford, perpend.
 Farewell.
  
    Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night;
    Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.
 If I do find it-well.
 'Twas a good sensible fellow.
 PAGE.
 Whither go you, George? Hark you.
 Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.
 FORD]  Look who comes yonder; she shall
    be our messenger to this paltry knight.
 Go in with us and see; we have an hour's talk
    with you.
 How now, Master Ford!
  FORD.
 Ay, marry, does he.
  
  FORD.


                           Enter HOST

  PAGE.
 Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes.

  HOST.
 Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
    the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
 Good mine host o' th' Garter, a word with you.
 Hark, I will tell you
    what our sport shall be.

  FORD.
 Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?
  PAGE.


A room in the Garter Inn

Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL

  FALSTAFF.
 Why, then the world's mine oyster.
 I have grated upon my good
    friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow,
    Nym; or else you had look'd through the grate, like a
    geminy of baboons.
 I am damn'd in hell for swearing to
    gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows;
    and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan,
    I took 't upon mine honour thou hadst it not.
 I, I, I myself
    sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding
    mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge,
    and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags,
    your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and
    your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour!
    You will not do it, you!
  PISTOL.


                     Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
  
  QUICKLY.

  FALSTAFF.
 I do believe the swearer.
 What with me?
  QUICKLY.
 Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
  FALSTAFF.
 I myself dwell with Master Doctor
    Caius.
 Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say-
  QUICKLY.

  FALSTAFF.

  QUICKLY.
 Yet
    there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with
    their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after
    letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
    rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant
    terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the
    fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and I
    warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her.
 Marry, she hath receiv'd your letter; for the
    which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
    to notify that her husband will be absence from his house
    between ten and eleven.
 Master Ford, her
    husband, will be from home.

  FALSTAFF.
 That were a jest indeed! They have not so little
    grace, I hope-that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page
    would desire you to send her your little page of all loves.

    Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page;
    and truly Master Page is an honest man.

  FALSTAFF.
 Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come
    and go between you both; and in any case have a
    nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy
    never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that
    children should know any wickedness.
 Old folks, you
    know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
 Will they yet look
    after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money,
    be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee.
 Let them say
    'tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.
 Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would
    fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
    sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.

  FALSTAFF.
 Brook is his name?
  BARDOLPH.
  [Exit BARDOLPH]  Such Brooks are
    welcome to me, that o'erflows such liquor.
 And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
  FORD.
 Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance
    of you.
 Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your
    porter.

  FORD.
 Speak, good Master Brook; I shall be glad to be
    your servant.
 Sir, I hear you are a scholar-I will be brief with you  
    -and you have been a man long known to me, though I
    had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted
    with you.

  FALSTAFF.
 I have long lov'd her, and, I protest to you, bestowed
    much on her; followed her with a doting observance;
    engross'd opportunities to meet her; fee'd every slight occasion
    that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not
    only bought many presents to give her, but have given
    largely to many to know what she would have given;
    briefly, I have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me; which
    hath been on the wing of all occasions.
'
  FALSTAFF.
 Of what quality was your love, then?
  FORD.
 Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
    that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where
    erected it.

  FALSTAFF.
 There is money; spend it,
    spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so
    much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable
    siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife; use your art of
    wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you
    may as soon as any.

    FALSTAFF.

  FORD.

  FORD.
 Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him
    not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the  
    jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which
    his wife seems to me well-favour'd.

  FALSTAFF.
 Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer,
    well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils' additions, the names
    of fiends.
 God be prais'd for my
    jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
 I will prevent this, detect
    my wife, be reveng'd on Falstaff, and laugh at Page.

    I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute
    too late.
 Sir?
  CAIUS.

  CAIUS.
 Bless thee, bully doctor!
  SHALLOW.
 Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter,
    though now a man of peace.
 'Tis true, Master Shallow.
 Master Doctor
  CAIUS, I come to fetch you home.
 Mock-vater! Vat is dat?
  HOST.

  HOST.
 And, moreover, bully-but first:  [Aside to the others]
    Master Guest, and Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender,
    go you through the town to Frogmore.

  PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER.
 For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
    Page.
 By gar, 'tis good; vell said.
 Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.

 Indeed she is.

    now she's going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her.

 What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee
    there's something extra-ordinary in thee.
 Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress
    Page.

  MRS.
 Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could
    not be in that mind.

  ROBIN.
  [Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
    Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking
    wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.

  MRS.
 Pray you, do so; she's a very tattling woman.
 Why, alas, what's the matter?
  MRS.
 FORD.
 He's too big to go in there.
  [Aside to MRS.
 PAGE]  I love thee and none but  
    thee; help me away.
 Carry them to the laundress
    in Datchet Mead; quickly, come.


         Enter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

  FORD.
  
  FORD.
 Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck!
    Buck, buck, buck! ay, buck! I warrant you, buck; and of
    the season too, it shall appear.

    Let me stop this way first.

  FORD.
 Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport
    anon; follow me, gentlemen.
 FORD.
 What a taking was he in when your husband
    ask'd who was in the basket!
  MRS.
 I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have
    more tricks with Falstaff.
  [Aside to MRS.

  FORD.
 Be gar, nor I too; there is no bodies.
 I pray you pardon me; I will hereafter make
    known to you why I have done this.
 If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
 Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart.
 Alas, how then?
  FENTON.

  ANNE.
 Gentle Master Fenton,
    Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir.
 Break their talk, Mistress Quickly; my kinsman
    shall speak for himself.
 Be not dismay'd.

  SLENDER.
 I care not for that,
    but that I am afeard.

  QUICKLY.
  
  ANNE.
  [Aside]  This is my father's choice.

  SLENDER.
 Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
    Gloucestershire.

  SLENDER.

  SHALLOW.
 Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that
    good comfort.
 Now, Master Slender-
  SLENDER.

  ANNE.
 Your father and my uncle hath made motions;
    if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They
    can tell you how things go better than I can.

  FENTON.

    Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
  
  MRS.
 Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.
 I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
    Give my sweet Nan this ring.
 There's for thy pains.
 But yet I would my
    master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had
    her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her; I will
    do what I can for them all three, for so I have promis'd,  
    and I'll be as good as my word; but speciously for Master
    Fenton.
 Call her in.
 Give your
    worship good morrow.
 Go, brew me a pottle
    of sack finely.

  FALSTAFF.

  QUICKLY.
 She'll make
    you amends, I warrant you.
 Well, I Will visit her.
 I will tell her.
  
  QUICKLY.


                       Enter FORD disguised

  FORD.
 Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.
 No.

  FORD.
 I quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have
    search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold,
    held his hand.
 Think of that
    -a man of my kidney.
 Her
    husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from
    her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is
    the hour, Master Brook.
 You shall have her, Master
    Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.
 Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep?
    Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford.

 What a woman are you! Away with him,

  MRS.
 I would my husband would meet him in this
    shape; he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford; he
    swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath
    threat'ned to beat her.
 Ay, in good sadness is he; and talks of the basket
    too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.

  MRS.
 I'll first direct my men what they shall do with
    the basket.
 Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse
    him enough.
 Come, come, take it up.

  SECOND SERVANT.
 Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
    way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain!

  FORD.
 Hang her, witch!

 By yea and no, I think the oman is a witch indeed; I
    like not when a oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard
    under his muffler.
 FORD.
 FORD.
 Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd
    him?
  MRS.
 Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
    horses; the Duke himself will be to-morrow at court, and
    they are going to meet him.

  PAGE.

  FORD.
 Pardon me, wife.
 Henceforth, do what thou wilt;
    I rather will suspect the sun with cold
    Than thee with wantonness.
 There is no better way than that they spoke of.
 There is an old tale goes that Heme the Hunter,
    Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,
    Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
    Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
    And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
    And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
    In a most hideous and dreadful manner.

    You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
    The superstitious idle-headed eld
    Receiv'd, and did deliver to our age,  
    This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truth.

  PAGE.
 Why yet there want not many that do fear
    In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.

  FORD.
 That will be excellent.

SCENE 5.
 Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
    from Master Slender.

  SIMPLE.

    Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs
    military.

  FALSTAFF.
  [Above]  How now, mine host?
  HOST.
 There was, mine host, an old fat woman even
    now with, me; but she's gone.
 Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
    Brainford?
  FALSTAFF.
 What would you
    with her?
  SIMPLE.

  SIMPLE.
 I would I could have spoken with the woman
    herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,  
    from him.
 What are they? Let us know.

  SIMPLE.
 I may not conceal them, sir.
.
 'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

  SIMPLE.
 They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain; do not
    say they be fled.

  FALSTAFF.
 From the two parties, forsooth.
 And have not they suffer'd? Yes, I warrant;
    speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten
    black and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.
  
  FALSTAFF.

  FALSTAFF.
 Come up into my chamber.
 Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I
    will give over all.

  FENTON.
 To this her mother's plot
    She seemingly obedient likewise hath
    Made promise to the doctor.
 Now thus it rests:
    Her father means she shall be all in white;
    And in that habit, when Slender sees his time  
    To take her by the hand and bid her go,
    She shall go with him; her mother hath intended
    The better to denote her to the doctor-
    For they must all be mask'd and vizarded-
    That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd,
    With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
    And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
    To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
    The maid hath given consent to go with him.
 So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
    Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

 Master Brook, the matter will
    be known tonight or never.
 Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
    you had appointed?  
  FALSTAFF.
 That same knave Ford, her husband, hath
    the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that
    ever govern'd frenzy.
 Come, come; we'll couch i' th' Castle ditch till we
    see the light of our fairies.
 That's good too; but what needs either your mum
    or her budget? The white will decipher her well enough.

    It hath struck ten o'clock.
 The night is dark; light and spirits will become it well.

 I know vat I have to do; adieu.
 Fare you well, sir.

    Be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and when I
    give the watch-ords, do as I pid you.
 You were also,

  FALSTAFF.
 My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
    potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves, hail

    That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
    Raise up the organs of her fantasy
    Sleep she as sound as careless infancy;
    But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
    Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.

 And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

 Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!

 Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'?

 If it had not been i'
    th' church, I would have swing'd him, or he should have
    swing'd me.
 Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
 I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she
    cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was
    not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
 Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha'
    married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is

 Good my mother, pardon.
 Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
  FENTON.
 Hear the truth of it.

    The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
    Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
 PAGE.
 Let it be so.
     Exit PHILOSTRATE
    Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,  
    And won thy love doing thee injuries;
    But I will wed thee in another key,
    With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
 Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
  THESEUS.
 Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?
  EGEUS.
 My noble lord,
    This man hath my consent to marry her.

    To you your father should be as a god;
    One that compos'd your beauties; yea, and one
    To whom you are but as a form in wax,
    By him imprinted, and within his power
    To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
 So is Lysander.

  THESEUS.
 Either to die the death, or to abjure
    For ever the society of men.
 Take time to pause; and by the next new moon-
    The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
    For everlasting bond of fellowship-
    Upon that day either prepare to die
    For disobedience to your father's will,
    Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
    Or on Diana's altar to protest
    For aye austerity and single life.
 Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
    And what is mine my love shall render him;
    And she is mine; and all my right of her
    I do estate unto Demetrius.

  LYSANDER.
 I must confess that I have heard so much,  
    And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
    But, being over-full of self-affairs,
    My mind did lose it.

    For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
    To fit your fancies to your father's will,
    Or else the law of Athens yields you up-
    Which by no means we may extenuate-
    To death, or to a vow of single life.
 Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
  HERMIA.

  LYSANDER.
 If then true lovers have ever cross'd,  
    It stands as an edict in destiny.

  LYSANDER.
 If thou lovest me then,
    Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
    And in the wood, a league without the town,
    Where I did meet thee once with Helena
    To do observance to a morn of May,
    There will I stay for thee.
 Keep promise, love.

    Sickness is catching; O, were favour so,  
    Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go!
    My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
    My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.

    O, teach me how you look, and with what art
    You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
  HERMIA.

  HELENA.
 The more I love, the more he hateth me.

  HERMIA.
 None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
  HERMIA.

    O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,  
    That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
  LYSANDER.
 And in the wood where often you and I
    Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
    Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
    And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
    To seek new friends and stranger companies.
 How happy some o'er other some can be!  
    Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.

    I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;  
    Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
    Pursue her; and for this intelligence
    If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.

ACT II.
 SCENE I.


    I must go seek some dewdrops here,
    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.

    But room, fairy, here comes Oberon.

  TITANIA.

  OBERON.
 Then I must be thy lady; but I know
    When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
    And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
    Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
    To amorous Phillida.
 How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
    Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
    Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
    Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
    From Perigouna, whom he ravished?
    And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
    With Ariadne and Antiopa?
  TITANIA.

    Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
    As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
    Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
    Hath every pelting river made so proud  
    That they have overborne their continents.

    The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
    The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
    Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
    The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
    And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
    The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
    And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
    For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.

    And thorough this distemperature we see
    The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
    Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
    And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
    An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
    Is, as in mockery, set.
 The spring, the summer,  
    The childing autumn, angry winter, change
    Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,
    By their increase, now knows not which is which.

    And this same progeny of evils comes
    From our debate, from our dissension;
    We are their parents and original.
 Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.

  OBERON.

    If you will patiently dance in our round,
    And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
    If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

  TITANIA.

  OBERON.
  

               Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA following him

  DEMETRIUS.

    Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood,
    And here am I, and wood within this wood,
    Because I cannot meet my Hermia.

  HELENA.

    I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
    The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
 And I am sick when I look not on you.

  DEMETRIUS.
 You do impeach your modesty too much
    To leave the city and commit yourself
    Into the hands of one that loves you not;
    To trust the opportunity of night,
    And the ill counsel of a desert place,
    With the rich worth of your virginity.

  HELENA.
 Your virtue is my privilege for that:
    It is not night when I do see your face,
    Therefore I think I am not in the night;
    Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
    For you, in my respect, are all the world.
 I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
    And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
 The wildest hath not such a heart as you.

    Run when you will; the story shall be chang'd:
    Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
    The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
    Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed,
    When cowardice pursues and valour flies.

    And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
 Sing me now asleep;
    Then to your offices, and let me rest.

  HERMIA.

  LYSANDER.
 Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
    Lie further off yet; do not lie so near.
 Lysander riddles very prettily.
 With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
                                                    [They sleep]

                          Enter PUCK  

  PUCK.

  DEMETRIUS.
            Exit
  HELENA.

    What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
    Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
    But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
    Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.

    What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
    Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.

  HELENA.

    Either death or you I'll find immediately.

 SCENE I.

The wood.
 Are we all met?
  QUINCE.
 This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn
    brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will
    do it before the Duke.
 What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
  BOTTOM.

  STARVELING.
 I fear it, I promise you.
 Yes, it doth shine that night.
 Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
    lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person
    of Moonshine.
 Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some
    plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify
    wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny
    shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
 What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here,
    So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?
    What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
    An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
 Must I speak now?  
  QUINCE.
 Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me
    afeard.


  TITANIA.

    Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note;
    So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
    And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,  
    On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.

  BOTTOM.
 Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
 Hail, mortal!  
  COBWEB.

  BOTTOM.
 I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
    Cobweb.

    The moon, methinks, looks with a wat'ry eye;
    And when she weeps, weeps every little flower;
    Lamenting some enforced chastity.


                          Enter PUCK

    Here comes my messenger.
 When they him spy,
    As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
    Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
    Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
    Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
    So at his sight away his fellows fly;
    And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;
    He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.

    I led them on in this distracted fear,
    And left sweet Pyramus translated there;
    When in that moment, so it came to pass,
    Titania wak'd, and straightway lov'd an ass.
 This falls out better than I could devise.


                 Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA

  OBERON.

    If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
    Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
    And kill me too.

  HERMIA.
 You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
    I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
    Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

    By some illusion see thou bring her here;
    I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
       Flower of this purple dye,
                Hit with Cupid's archery,
                Sink in apple of his eye.


                       Re-enter PUCK
  
  PUCK.
 O, let me kiss
    This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  HELENA.
 Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

    If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
  
    But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
  LYSANDER.
 Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
    Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
    Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.

  HERMIA.

  HERMIA.

    If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
    You would not make me such an argument.
  
    But fare ye well; 'tis partly my own fault,
    Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.

  LYSANDER.
 If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

  LYSANDER.

  HERMIA.
 No, no, he will
    Seem to break loose- take on as you would follow,
    But yet come not.
 What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
    Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
 What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
    Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
    Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
    I am as fair now as I was erewhile.

    Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!-
    In earnest, shall I say?  
  LYSANDER.

    Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
    Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
    That I do hate thee and love Helena.
 I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
    Let her not hurt me.
 I was never curst;
    I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
    I am a right maid for my cowardice;
    Let her not strike me.
 Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.

    I evermore did love you, Hermia,
    Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
    Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
    I told him of your stealth unto this wood.

    He followed you; for love I followed him;
    But he hath chid me hence, and threat'ned me
    To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;
    And now, so you will let me quiet go,  
    To Athens will I bear my folly back,
    And follow you no further.

    You see how simple and how fond I am.
 What! with Lysander?
  HELENA.
 I will not trust you, I;
    Nor longer stay in your curst company.
            Exit
  OBERON.
 This is thy negligence.
 Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.

    Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
    I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
    And then I will her charmed eye release
    From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

  PUCK.

  OBERON.

    Here comes one.
 I will be with thee straight.
      Exit LYSANDER as following the voice  

                      Enter DEMETRIUS

  DEMETRIUS.

    Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
    Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
  PUCK.
 Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
    Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
    And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child;
    I'll whip thee with a rod.

  DEMETRIUS.

    I followed fast, but faster he did fly,  
    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
    And here will rest me.
       Yet but three? Come one more;
              Two of both kinds makes up four.
 Never so weary, never so in woe,
    Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,
    I can no further crawl, no further go;
    My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
          On the ground
                 Sleep sound;
                 I'll apply
                 To your eye,
          Gentle lover, remedy.
  
 Exit

 I have a reasonable good ear in music.
 Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

  TITANIA.

  BOTTOM.
 Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.

    Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.

    O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!         [They sleep]

  OBERON.

    But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
 My Oberon! What visions have I seen!
    Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
 Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep.
 Sound, music.
     Then, my Queen, in silence sad,
              Trip we after night's shade.
 Go, one of you, find out the forester;
    For now our observation is perform'd,
    And since we have the vaward of the day,
    My love shall hear the music of my hounds.

  HIPPOLYTA.
 A cry more tuneable
    Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
    In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.

    I wonder of their being here together.

  THESEUS.
 My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
    Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,
    I cannot truly say how I came here,
    But, as I think- for truly would I speak,
    And now I do bethink me, so it is-
    I came with Hermia hither.

    But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
    But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
    Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
    And will for evermore be true to it.

    And, for the morning now is something worn,
    Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
 Are you sure
    That we are awake? It seems to me
    That yet we sleep, we dream.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
    And by the way let us recount our dreams.

    Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
    Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
    More than cool reason ever comprehends.

    The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
    Are of imagination all compact.
 But all the story of the night told over,
    And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
    More witnesseth than fancy's images,
    And grows to something of great constancy,
    But howsoever strange and admirable.

    'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
    Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary.

    And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
    For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.

    Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,
    Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
    The passion of loud laughter never shed.

  THESEUS.
 Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  LYSANDER.
 He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not
    the stop.
 A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but
    to speak true.

    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.

    This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
    That I am that same wall; the truth is so;
    And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
    Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
 O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
    O night, which ever art when day is not!
    O night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
    I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
    And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
    That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;  
    Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
    Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.

    O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,
    Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me!
  THESEUS.
 The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

  PYRAMUS.

  PYRAMUS.
 Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
    And like Limander am I trusty still.
 Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
 The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
    no worse, if imagination amend them.


                   Enter LION and MOONSHINE

  LION.

  LYSANDER.

  THESEUS.
 Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his  
    discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
 Leave it to his
    discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.
 This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  DEMETRIUS.
 He should have worn the horns on his head.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Well run, Thisby.


                        Re-enter PYRAMUS

  DEMETRIUS.
 And then came Pyramus.

  PYRAMUS.
 Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;  
    I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
    For, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,
    I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.

             O Fates! come, come;
             Cut thread and thrum;
           Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.
 O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;  
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame
    That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.

             Now am I dead,
             Now am I fled;
           My soul is in the sky.

             Tongue, lose thy light;
             Moon, take thy flight.
                   [Dies]
  DEMETRIUS.
 Here she comes; and her
    passion ends the play.

  HIPPOLYTA.

  DEMETRIUS.
      Asleep, my love?
               What, dead, my dove?
             O Pyramus, arise,
               Speak, speak.

               These lily lips,
               This cherry nose,  
             These yellow cowslip cheeks,
               Are gone, are gone;
               Lovers, make moan;
             His eyes were green as leeks.

               Come, trusty sword;
             Come, blade, my breast imbrue.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and
    hang'd himself in Thisby's garter, it would have been a fine
    tragedy.

    Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.

             Trip away; make no stay;
             Meet me all by break of day.

             If you pardon, we will mend.

  Beatrice, niece to Leonato.

  Ursula, waiting gentlewoman attending on Hero.
>>



SCENE.
--Messina.

An orchard before Leonato's house.
 I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
    a young Florentine called Claudio.

  Mess.

  Leon.
 In great measure.
 There are no faces truer than
    those that are so wash'd.
 How much better is it to weep at joy
    than to joy at weeping!
  Beat.
 I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no?
  Mess.
 There was none such in the
    army of any sort.
 My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
 Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll  
    be meet with you, I doubt it not.
 He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

  Beat.
 He is no less than a stuff'd man; but for
    the stuffing--well, we are all mortal.
 There is a kind of merry
    war betwixt Signior Benedick and her.

  Beat.
 He wears his faith but as the fashion
    of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.

  Mess.
 I will hold friends with you, lady.
 Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace;
    for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart
    from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.

  Pedro.
 I think this is your
    daughter.
 Be happy, lady;
    for you are like an honourable father.
 If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head
    on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.

  Beat.
 Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
    food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert  
    to disdain if you come in her presence.
 God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman
    or other shall scape a predestinate scratch'd face.
 Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as
    yours were.

  Beat.
 You always end with a jade's trick.
 Signior Claudio and Signior
    Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
 I tell him
    we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays  
    some occasion may detain us longer.

  John.
 Please it your Grace lead on?
  Pedro.
 Your hand, Leonato.
 We will go together.
 Manent Benedick and Claudio.
 I pray thee tell me truly how
    thou lik'st her.


                       Enter Don Pedro.
 What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to
    Leonato's?
  Bene.
  
  Pedro.
 Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
 You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
 And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

    I will die in it at the stake.
 Because I will not do them
    the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust
    none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will  
    live a bachelor.

  Pedro.

  Bene.
'
  Bene.
 The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
    it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead, and
    let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write
    'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
    'Here you may see Benedick the married man.
  
  Pedro.

  Bene.
 Well, you will temporize with the hours.
 In the meantime,
    good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's, commend me to him and
    tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
    great preparation.

  Bene.
 The sixth of July.
 Ere you flout old ends any further, examine
    your conscience.

  Pedro.
 What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
    The fairest grant is the necessity.


  Leon.
 He is very busy about it.
 But, brother, I can tell you strange
    news that you yet dreamt not of.

  Leon.
 A good sharp fellow.
                              [Exit Antonio.

  John.
 I am trusted with a muzzle and
    enfranchis'd with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in
    my cage.

  Con.


    Who comes here? What news, Borachio?
  Bora.
 The Prince your brother is
    royally entertain'd by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence  
    of an intended marriage.

  John.
 Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

  John.

  John.
 If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.

    You are both sure, and will assist me?
  Con.
 To the death, my lord.
>>



ACT II.
 How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am
    heart-burn'd an hour after.
  
  Ant.

  Leon.
 Lord, I could not
    endure a husband with a beard on his face.
 Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I
    hold it a sin to match in my kinred.

  Leon.
 I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
 Make good room.
]

    Enter, [masked,] Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Balthasar.

       [With them enter Antonio, also masked.
 Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?
  Hero.

  Pedro.
 Well, I would you did like me.

  Marg.
 And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done!
    Answer, clerk.

  Balth.

                                              [Takes her aside.
]
  Urs.
 I know you well enough.
  
  Ant.
 What's he?
  Beat.
 Not I, believe me.

  Bene.
 You may do the part of an honest man in it.

  Claud.
 How know you he loves her?
  John.
 I heard him swear his affection.
 The Prince wooes for himself.

    This is an accident of hourly proof,
    Which I mistrusted not.

  Claud.
 Ho! now you strike like the blind man! 'Twas the boy that
    stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
 Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
 Now, signior, where's the Count? Did you see him?
  Bene.
 Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame, I found
    him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.
  
  Pedro.

  Pedro.
 Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is
    in the stealer.

  Pedro.
 O, she misus'd me past the endurance of a block! An oak but
    with one green leaf on it would have answered her; my very visor
    began to assume life and scold with her.
 If her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
    there were no living near her; she would infect to the North
    Star.
 Come, talk not of her.
 I would to God some scholar would
    conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as
    quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose,
    because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror,
    and perturbation follows her.
                                              [Exit.
 Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for
    it--a double heart for his single one.
 So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove
    the mother of fools.
 Not sad, my lord.

  Pedro.

  Beat.
 I have broke with
    her father, and his good will obtained.
 Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.
 Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.
 I were but little
    happy if I could say how much.

  Claud.
 And so she doth, cousin.

  Beat.
 I may sit in a corner and cry 'Heigh-ho for
    a husband!'
  Pedro.
 Will you have me, lady?
  Beat.
 No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days:
    your Grace is too costly to wear every day.
 Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes
    you, for out o' question you were born in a merry hour.
 Cousins, God give you joy!
  Leon.
 I cry you mercy, uncle, By your Grace's pardon.

  Pedro.
 She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

  Pedro.
 And you too, gentle Hero?
  Hero.
 Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

A hall in Leonato's house.

  John.
 Go you to the  
    Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
    his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio (whose estimation do
    you mightily hold up) to a contaminated stale, such a one as
    Hero.

  John.
 Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo
    Hero, and kill Leonato.
 Boy!

                    [Enter Boy.

    (Exit Boy.
                                         [Hides.

                      Music [within].
 Yea, my good lord.
 How still the evening is,
    As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
  Pedro.


  Pedro.

  Balth.
 O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
    To slander music any more than once.
 Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,
    Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
    To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
    Yet will he swear he loves.
]
                      The Song.

            Then sigh not so,
            But let them go,
          And be you blithe and bonny,
        Converting all your sounds of woe  
          Into Hey nonny, nonny.


  Pedro.
 By my troth, a good song.

  Pedro.

  Bene.
 [aside] An he had been a dog that should have howl'd thus,
    they would have hang'd him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no
    mischief.
 Do so.
 Farewell.
  
                                Exit Balthasar [with Musicians].
 O, ay!-[Aside to Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits.

  Leon.
 What effects, my lord? She will sit you--you heard my
    daughter tell you how.

  Claud.
  
  Leon.
 O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
    'Benedick' and 'Beatrice' between the sheet?
  Claud.

  Leon.
 Yea, though I
    love him, I should.
 Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her
    heart, tears her hair, prays, curses--'O sweet Benedick! God give
    me patience!'
  Leon.
  
  Claud.

  Pedro.
 I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.
 I pray you
    tell Benedick of it and hear what 'a will say.

  Pedro.
 Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
    her love?
  Claud.
 Nay, that's impossible; she may wear her heart out first.
]  
  Claud.
 Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your
    daughter and her gentlewomen carry.
]

  Bene.
 They say the
    lady is fair--'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous  
    --'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me--by
    my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of
    her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her.
 I may chance
    have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I
    have railed so long against marriage.
 When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not
    think I should live till I were married.

  Beat.
 Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
 I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
    thank me.
 If it had been painful, I would not have come.

  Bene.

Exit.

  Bene.
 'I took no more pains for those
    thanks than you took pains to thank me.
                   Exit.

    There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
    Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.

  Marg.
 Of this matter
    Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
    That only wounds by hearsay.
 The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
    Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
    And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
]
    No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.
 But are you sure
    That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
  Hero.

  Urs.

  Urs.

  Hero.
 Yet tell her of it.
 Hear what she will say.

    And truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
    To stain my cousin with.

  Urs.

  Hero.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.

  Bene.
 So say I.
 I hope he be in love.

  Bene.
 Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.
 Unless he have a fancy to this
    foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you
    would have it appear he is.
 Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
  Claud.

  Pedro.
 Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for
    him.
 Yet is this no charm for the toothache.
]  
  Pedro.
 Good den, brother.
 In private?
  John.
 Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I
    would speak of concerns him.

  Pedro.
 What's the matter?
  John.
 The word is too good to paint out her wickedness.
 If you love her then, to-morrow wed her.
 But it
    would better fit your honour to change your mind.
 May this be so?
  Pedro.
 O day untowardly turned!
  Claud.
 O plague right well prevented!
    So will you say when you have seen the Sequel.

                                                         Exeunt.
 Are you good men and true?
  Verg.
 Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation,
    body and soul.

  Verg.
 God hath bless'd you with a
    good name.
 You have.
 Therefore
    bear you the lanthorn.
 Watch.
 You shall also make no noise in the streets; for for
    the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable, and not to be
    endured.
 We will rather sleep than talk.
 How if they will not?
  Dog.
 If they make you
    not then the better answer, You may say they are not the men you
    took them for.
 Watch.

  Dog.
 Why then, depart in peace and let the child wake her with
    crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will
    never answer a calf when he bleats.

  Verg.

  Dog.
 Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night.
 An there be any matter
    of weight chances, call up me.
 Come, neighbour.

  2.
 Watch.
 Well, masters, we hear our charge.
 Let us go sit here
    upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.


  Bora.
 I am at thy elbow.
 I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy
    tale.
 Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
  Bora.
 I wonder at it.

  Con.
 Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
 Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool.
 But seest thou
    not what a deformed thief this fashion is?
  2.

  Bora.
 No; 'twas the vane on the house.
 And thought they Margaret was Hero?
  Bora.

  2.
 Watch.
 Come, we'll obey you.

                                                         Exeunt.

A Room in Leonato's house.
 I will, lady.
                                             [Exit.
]
  Marg.
 By my troth, 's not so good, and I warrant your cousin will
    say so.
 I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a
    thought browner; and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith.

    I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.

  Hero.
 Is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband'?
    None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife.
 Good morrow, coz.
  
  Marg.

  Beat.

  Marg.

    By my troth, I am exceeding ill.

  Marg.
 Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
  Hero.
 Doth not my wit become me rarely?  
  Beat.
 It is not seen enough.
 Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant
    plain holy thistle.
 Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns
    you nearly.

  Verg.
 Yes, in truth it is, sir.

  Leon.
 Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an
    old man and no honester than I.
 Neighbours, you are tedious.

  Dog.
 All thy tediousness on me, ah?
  Dog.
 Yea, in 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for I hear as
    good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city; and
    though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.

  Verg.
 A good old man, sir; he will be talking.
' God help us! it is a world to
    see! Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges.
 One word, sir.
 Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
    aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined
    before your worship.

  Leon.
 Take their examination yourself and bring it me.

  Leon.
 My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her
    husband.
 I'll wait upon them.

SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC.
 Only to the plain form of
    marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties
    afterwards.

  Friar.
 You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
  Claud.

  Friar.
 Know you any, Count?
  Leon.
 And what have I to give you back whose worth
    May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
  Pedro.

    Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
    O, what authority and show of truth
    Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
    Comes not that blood as modest evidence
    To witness simple virtue, Would you not swear,
    All you that see her, that she were a maid
    By these exterior shows? But she is none:  
    She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
    Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
 What do you mean, my lord?
  Claud.

    No, Leonato,
    I never tempted her with word too large,
    But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
    Bashful sincerity and comely love.
 Out on the seeming! I will write against it.
 What should I speak?
    I stand dishonour'd that have gone about
    To link my dear friend to a common stale.
 Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

  Hero.

  Leon.
 To make you answer truly to your name.
 O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been
    If half thy outward graces had been plac'd
    About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
    But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! Farewell,
    Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
    And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
    To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
    And never shall it more be gracious.
 Why, how now, cousin? Wherefore sink you down?
  John.

                      [Exeunt Don Pedro, Don Juan, and Claudio.
]
  Bene.
 How doth the lady?
  Beat.
 Yea, wherefore should she not?
  Leon.
 Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing
    Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
    The story that is printed in her blood?
    Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes;
    For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
    Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
    Myself would on the rearward of reproaches
    Strike at thy life.
 Griev'd I, I had but one?
    Child I for that at frugal nature's frame?
    O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
    Why had I not with charitable hand  
    Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
    Who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy,
    I might have said, 'No part of it is mine;
    This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
    But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd,
    And mine that I was proud on--mine so much
    That I myself was to myself not mine,
    Valuing of her--why, she, O, she is fall'n
    Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
    Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,
    And salt too little which may season give
    To her foul tainted flesh!
  Bene.
 Sir, sir, be patient.

  Friar.
 Hear me a little;
    For I have only been silent so long,
    And given way unto this course of fortune,
    By noting of the lady.
 Call me a fool;
    Trust not my reading nor my observation,
    Which with experimental seal doth warrant
    The tenure of my book; trust not my age,
    My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
    If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
    Under some biting error.
 I know not.
 Then shall he mourn
    (If ever love had interest in his liver)
    And wish he had not so accused her--
    No, though be thought his accusation true.

    Let this be so, and doubt not but success
    Will fashion the event in better shape
    Than I can lay it down in likelihood.

    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
    As best befits her wounded reputation,
    In some reclusive and religious life,
    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.

  Bene.

                         Exeunt [all but Benedick and Beatrice].

  Bene.
 Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

  Beat.

  Bene.

  Bene.
 I do love nothing in the world so well as you.
 As strange as the thing I know not.
 But believe me not; and
    yet I lie not.
 I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing.

  Bene.

  Beat.

  Beat.
 Kill Claudio.
 You kill me to deny it.
 Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

  Beat.
 He is now
    as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie,and swears it.

  Beat.
 Enough, I am engag'd, I will challenge him.
 Go comfort your
    cousin.

 Scene I.

The street, near Leonato's house.

    No, no! 'Tis all men's office to speak patience
    To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
    But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
    To be so moral when he shall endure
    The like himself.

  Ant.

  Leon.

  Ant.

  Leon.

    My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
    And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,
    And all of them that thus dishonour her.

  Pedro.

  Claud.

  Claud.
 Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me
    I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
    As under privilege of age to brag
    What I have done being young, or what would do,
    Were I not old.
 Thine, Claudio; thine I say.

  Pedro.

    Come, follow me, boy,.
 God knows I lov'd my niece,  
    And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
    That dare as well answer a man indeed
    As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
  
  Leon.
 And shall, or some of us will smart for it.


                  Enter Benedick.

  Claud.
 We had lik'd to have had our two noses snapp'd off with two
    old men without teeth.
 In a false quarrel there is no true valour.
 I jest not; I will make
    it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare.
 You have kill'd a
    sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you.
 Let me hear
    from you.
 Shall I not find a woodcock too?
  Bene.
' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.
' 'Right,' says she, 'a great
    gross one.
' 'Just,' said she, 'it
    hurts nobody.
 Yet at last she
    concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy.
 All, all! and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the
    garden.
 I must discontinue your company.

                                                         [Exit.
 In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the  
    love of Beatrice.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.

  Pedro.
 Do you
    hear me, and let this Count kill me.
 I have deceived even your
    very eyes.
 Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.
 He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery,
    And fled he is upon this villany.
 Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.


          Enter Leonato, his brother [Antonio], and the Sexton.
 Which of these is he?
  Bora.

  Leon.

  Leon.
 Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth,
    and I praise God for you.
 God restore you
    to health! I humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
    meeting may be wish'd, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.
 Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.

  Claud.
 Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
  Bene.

  Marg.

    And so I pray thee call Beatrice.

  Marg.
 Marry, I cannot show it in
    rhyme.


                    Enter Beatrice.

  Bene.
 O, stay but till then!
  Beat.

  Bene.
 For them all together, which maintain'd so politic a state of
    evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
    them.
 So much for praising
    myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy.
 And now
    tell me, how doth your cousin?
  Beat.
 Madam, you must come to your uncle.

    It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accus'd, the Prince
    and Claudio mightily abus'd, and Don John is the author of all,
    who is fled and gone.


Enter Claudio, Don Pedro, and three or four with tapers,
[followed by Musicians].
 It is, my lord.

        Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
          Gives her fame which never dies.

    The wolves have prey'd, and look, the gentle day,
    Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about  
    Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
 Fare you well.
 Each his several way.
          Exeunt.
 Did I not tell you she was innocent?
  Leon.
 Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

  Friar.

  Leon.
 That eye my daughter lent her.
 And I do with an eye of love requite her.

  Leon.
 Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.

  Leon.
 Here's the friar ready.
 Good morrow, Benedick.
 Why, what's the matter
    That you have such a February face,
    So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?
  Claud.

  Bene.
 Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,
    And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
    And got a calf in that same noble feat  
    Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

  Claud.

    I am your husband if you like of me.
 Another Hero!
  Hero.

    One Hero died defil'd; but I do live,
    And surely as I live, I am a maid.

  Pedro.
 The former Hero! Hero that is dead!  
  Leon.
 Soft and fair, friar.

  Beat.
 They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

  Bene.
 'Tis no such matter.
 And here's another,
    Writ in my cousin's hand, stol'n from her pocket,
    Containing her affection unto Benedick.
 Dost thou think I care for a satire or
    an epigram? No.
 If a man will be beaten with brains, 'a shall
    wear nothing handsome about him.
 I had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I
    might have cudgell'd thee out of thy single life, to make thee a
    double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do
    not look exceeding narrowly to thee.

  Bene.
 First, of my word! Therefore play, music.
 Think not on him till to-morrow.

 SCENE I.

    If ever I did dream of such a matter,
    Abhor me.

    But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
    Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance
    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,
    And, in conclusion,
    Nonsuits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he,
    "I have already chose my officer.

  IAGO.

    For when my outward action doth demonstrate
    The native act and figure of my heart
    In complement extern, 'tis not long after
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

  RODERIGO.
 Not I.
 What are you?
  RODERIGO.
 My name is Roderigo.

    I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.

    In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
    To start my quiet.
 Sir, sir, sir-
  BRABANTIO.

  RODERIGO.
                      Patience, good sir.
 What tell'st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;
    My house is not a grange.
                   Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pure soul I come to you.

  IAGO.

  BRABANTIO.
 This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
               Strike on the tinder, ho!
    Give me a taper! Call up all my people!
    This accident is not unlike my dream;
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
  
    It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
    To be produced- as, if I stay, I shall-
    Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some check,
    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
    Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,
    Another of his fathom they have none
    To lead their business; in which regard,
    Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
    Yet for necessity of present life,
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,
    Which is indeed but sign.
 That you shall surely find him,
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,
    And there will I be with him.


  BRABANTIO.
 Pray you, lead on.
               Exeunt.

  OTHELLO.
 But I pray you, sir,
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As double as the Duke's.

  
           Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches.

    I will but spend a word here in the house  
    And go with you.
 It is Brabantio.
 I'll have't disputed on;
    'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
 If he do resist,
    Subdue him at his peril.

  BRABANTIO.
                How? The Duke in council?
    In this time of the night? Bring him away;
    Mine's not an idle cause.
            Exeunt.

  FIRST SENATOR.

  SECOND SENATOR.
 Nay, it is possible enough to judgement.

  SAILOR.
                                Now, what's the business?
  SAILOR.
                    This cannot be,
    By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant
    To keep us in false gaze.


  MESSENGER.
 The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
    Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

  DUKE.
 Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.

  FIRST SENATOR.


  DUKE.

  DUKE.

    She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
    For nature so preposterously to err,  
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
    Sans witchcraft could not.

    Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
    Your special mandate for the state affairs
    Hath hither brought.
 I therefore vouch again
    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
    He wrought upon her.
                     I do beseech you,
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
    And let her speak of me before her father.

  DUKE.
               I pray you, hear her speak.

  BRABANTIO.
 For your sake, jewel,
    I am glad at soul I have no other child;
    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them.

  DUKE.
 So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
    We lose it not so long as we can smile.

    These sentences, to sugar or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.

    Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and
    though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency,
    yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
    voice on you.
 I do agnize
    A natural and prompt alacrity
    I find in hardness and do undertake
    These present wars against the Ottomites.

    Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife,
    Due reference of place and exhibition,
    With such accommodation and besort
    As levels with her breeding.
              I'll not have it so.

  DESDEMONA.

  OTHELLO.
 Let her have your voices.
 No, when light-wing'd toys
    Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness
    My speculative and officed instruments,
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation!
  DUKE.
 Be it as you shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going.
  
    To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needful your good Grace shall think
    To be sent after me.
 Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
 We must obey the time.
 What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
    but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
 Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.

  IAGO.
 I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to
    thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
    better stead thee than now.
 I say, put
    money in thy purse.
 It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an
    answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse.
 She must have change, she must; therefore put money in
    thy purse.
 If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate
    way than drowning.
 Traverse, go, provide thy money.

  RODERIGO.
 I'll be with thee betimes.
 I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.
  
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be suspected- framed to make women false.

 Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
    A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.

    For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
    Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.

    I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.


                       Enter a third Gentleman.

                              A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"

                      Enter a fourth Gentleman.

  SECOND GENTLEMAN.
 They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
    Our friends at least.

  CASSIO.
                 I pray you, sir, go forth,
    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

  MONTANO.


                      Re-enter second Gentleman.

  CASSIO.
 He has had most favorable and happy speed:
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
    The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,
    As having sense of beauty, do omit
    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
    The divine Desdemona.

  MONTANO.
                What is she?
  CASSIO.
            I thank you, valiant Cassio.
 He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught
    But that he's well and will be shortly here.

                          A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
] Welcome, mistress.

    Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
 Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
    You'ld have enough.

  EMILIA.

  IAGO.
 What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
    praise me?
  IAGO.
 Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
  IAGO.
 I am not merry, but I do beguile
    The thing I am by seeming otherwise.

    Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
  IAGO.
 But my Muse labors,
    And thus she is deliver'd.
 How if fair and foolish?
  IAGO.
 What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and
    foolish?
  IAGO.
 There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
 How say you, Cassio? Is he not
    a most profane and liberal counselor?
  CASSIO.
  
    With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as
    Cassio.

  DESDEMONA.
             Come, let us to the castle.
  
    News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.

    Bring thou the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge much respect.
 I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest
    condition.
 Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the
    history of lust and foul thoughts.
 They met so near with their
    lips that their breaths embraced together.

  IAGO.

    Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
    At least into a jealousy so strong
    That judgement cannot cure.


Enter a Herald with a proclamation; people following.
 All offices are open, and
    there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
    till the bell have told eleven.


  OTHELLO.

                           Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.


  CASSIO.
 Our
    general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let
    us not therefore blame.
 She is indeed perfection.
 Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.


           Re-enter Cassio; with him Montano and Gentlemen;
                    Servants following with wine.
 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
 Some wine, ho!

    [Sings.
 I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in
    potting.

  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.
 I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.


               "He was a wight of high renown,
                 And thou art but of low degree.
 It's true, good lieutenant.

  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.
 You see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
    And give direction.

    He'll watch the horologe a double set,
    If drink rock not his cradle.
 [Aside to him.

  IAGO.
             Not I, for this fair island.
 A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a
    twiggen bottle.

  IAGO.
] Away, I say; go out and cry a mutiny.
 God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed forever.
 Nor know I aught
    By me that's said or done amiss this night,
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
    And to defend ourselves it be a sin
    When violence assails us.
                  Touch me not so near:
    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
    Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;  
    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
    Shall nothing wrong him.

    Montano and myself being in speech,
    There comes a fellow crying out for help,
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,
    To execute upon him.

    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
    Lest by his clamor- as it so fell out-
    The town might fall in fright.
 When I came back-
    For this was brief- I found them close together,
    At blow and thrust, even as again they were
    When you yourself did part them.

    More of this matter cannot I report.

    But men are men; the best sometimes forget.

    Iago, look with care about the town,
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.

  IAGO.
 I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
    quarrel, but nothing wherefore.

  CASSIO.

  IAGO.
 I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

  CASSIO.
 I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech
    the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.
 For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.


                           Enter Roderigo.
 I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
    hunts, but one that fills up the cry.

  IAGO.

    Content thyself awhile.

  CLOWN.
 Ay, marry, are they, sir.

  CLOWN.

  FIRST MUSICIAN.
 Well, sir, we will not.
 Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.

  CASSIO.
 There's a poor piece of gold
    for thee.
 Wilt thou do this?
  CLOWN.
 If she will stir hither, I shall seem
    to notify unto her.

  CASSIO.
 Do, good my friend.


                             Enter Iago.
 Why, no; the day had broke
    Before we parted.
] I never knew
    A Florentine more kind and honest.


  EMILIA.
 The Moor replies
    That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus  
    And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
    And needs no other suitor but his likings
    To take the safest occasion by the front
    To bring you in again.

   Exeunt.

The garden of the castle.


Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.
 Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
    All my abilities in thy behalf.

  EMILIA.
 Good madam, do.

  CASSIO.
 I am very ill at ease,  
    Unfit for mine own purposes.

  DESDEMONA.
 Ha! I like not that.
 What dost thou say?
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO.
 Who is't you mean?
  DESDEMONA.
 Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
 Shall't be tonight at supper?
  OTHELLO.
                                 No, not tonight.
 I wonder in my soul,
    What you would ask me, that I should deny,
    Or stand so mammering on.
 Let him come when he will;
    I will deny thee nothing.

  OTHELLO.
 Emilia, come.

  OTHELLO.
 I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
                    Men should be what they seem;
    Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
  OTHELLO.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.
                         I do beseech you-
    Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
    To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
    Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet,
    From one that so imperfectly conceits,
    Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
    Out of his scattering and unsure observance.

    Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.

  OTHELLO.
 That cuckold lives in bliss
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
    But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
  OTHELLO.
 Exchange me for a goat
    When I shall turn the business of my soul
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
    Matching thy inference.
 'Tis not to make me jealous
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.

    I know our country disposition well;
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
    Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
 She did deceive her father, marrying you;
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
    She loved them most.
                   I am bound to thee forever.
                          I'faith, I fear it has.

  OTHELLO.
 And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO.
              Farewell, farewell.
] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
    To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
 If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune.

  DESDEMONA.
 Come, I'll go in with you.


                            Re-enter Iago.


  IAGO.
                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA.
 What handkerchief?
    Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
    That which so often you did bid me steal.

  EMILIA.
 What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
    To have me filch it?
  IAGO.
] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA.

    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it.
 Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO.

    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
    Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.
 I am sorry to hear this.

  IAGO.
 O wretched fool,
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
    O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.

    I thank you for this profit, and from hence
    I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.

  OTHELLO.
 I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
    And loses that it works for.
                  Would? Nay, I will.
 I lay with Cassio lately
    And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
    I could not sleep.
 But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
 I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
    I am sure it was your wife's- did I today
    See Cassio wipe his beard with.

  OTHELLO.

    Now do I see 'tis true.

    Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!
    Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
    To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
  IAGO.
 O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO.
            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
    Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
    To furnish me with some swift means of death
    For the fair devil.

  IAGO.
 I am your own forever.

  DESDEMONA.
 Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN.
 I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
    and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own
    throat.
 Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA.
 I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
               Well, my good lord.

  OTHELLO.

  DESDEMONA.
 That handkerchief
    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
    She was a charmer, and could almost read
    The thoughts of people.

  DESDEMONA.
 Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.

    This is a trick to put me from my suit.
  
    Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
 The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA.
 The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA.
 Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA.

    Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
    I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full  
    They belch us.
 How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO.
 Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
    That by your virtuous means I may again
    Exist and be a member of his love
    Whom I with all the office of my heart
    Entirely honor.
           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
    My advocation is not now in tune;
    My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him
    Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.
 Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA.

  DESDEMONA.
 Nay, we must think men are not gods,
    Nor of them look for such observancy
    As fits the bridal.
 Beshrew me much, Emilia,
    I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
    Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
    But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
    And he's indicted falsely.

  DESDEMONA.

  CASSIO.

  BIANCA.

    What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
    Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,  
    More tedious than the dial eight score times?
    O weary reckoning!
  CASSIO.

    Is't come to this? Well, well.
 Ere it be demanded-  
    As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.
                       Why, I pray you?
  CASSIO.
 Not that I love you not.
                          But that you do not love me.


Enter Othello and Iago.

  IAGO.

    But if I give my wife a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO.
 What then?
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
 By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
                                           What,
    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
    Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad,
    Who having, by their own importunate suit,
    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
    Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
    But they must blab-
  OTHELLO.
              Hath he said anything?
  IAGO.
 Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
 Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach.

    Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
    He will recover straight.

    How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?
  OTHELLO.
 Dost thou mock me?
  IAGO.

    Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
  OTHELLO.
  
  IAGO.
 There's many a beast then in a populous city,
    And many a civil monster.
 Did he confess it?
  IAGO.
 Your case is better.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
  
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter.


                           Re-enter Cassio.
 I never knew a woman love man so.
 She gives it out that you shall marry her.
 I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
    to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome.

  CASSIO.
 This is the monkey's own giving out.
 She is persuaded I
    will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my
    promise.
 Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

  CASSIO.
 She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
 I was
    the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and
    thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus  
    about my neck-
  OTHELLO.

  CASSIO.
 Well, I must leave her company.
 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
 Wheresoever you had it, I'll take  
    out no work on't.

  IAGO.
 Prithee, come; will you?
  IAGO.
] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO.
 A fine woman! a fair
    woman! a sweet woman!
  IAGO.
 O, the world hath not a sweeter creature.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.
 She's the worse for all this.
 And then, of so gentle a
    condition!
  IAGO.
 O, 'tis foul in her.

  OTHELLO.
 I'll not expostulate
    with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.
 Something from Venice, sure.
 'Tis Lodovico
    Come from the Duke.
  
  LODOVICO.
 The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.

                                                  Gives him a letter.
 I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

                                         Opens the letter, and reads.

  LODOVICO.
 I thank you.
 Are you sure of that?
  DESDEMONA.
 Devil!                                        Strikes her.

    Make her amends; she weeps.
  
  LODOVICO.
 What would you with her, sir?
  LODOVICO.

    Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,
    And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
    And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
    Very obedient.
 Proceed you in your tears.
 He's that he is.
 You shall observe him,
    And his own courses will denote him so  
    That I may save my speech.
 I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

A room in the castle.
 Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

  OTHELLO.

    If any wretch have put this in your head,
    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!  
    For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
    There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
    Is foul as slander.


  DESDEMONA.
] Some of your function, mistress,
    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
    Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
           Exit Emilia.
 To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
  OTHELLO.
           By heaven, you do me wrong.
                       No, as I am a Christian.

    If to preserve this vessel for my lord
    From any other foul unlawful touch  
    Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
 What, not a whore?
  DESDEMONA.
 Faith, half asleep.

  DESDEMONA.
                     He that is yours, sweet lady.
                        Here's a change indeed!
     Exit.
 I cannot tell.
 Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
    Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
    As true hearts cannot bear.
 Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO.

  IAGO.
 Alas the day!
  EMILIA.
 It is my wretched fortune.

  IAGO.
                       Nay, heaven doth know.

  IAGO.

    O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world
    Even from the east to the west!
  IAGO.
                             Speak within door.

  EMILIA.
 O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
    That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
    And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
                   O good Iago,
    What shall I do to win my lord again?
    Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,
    I know not how I lost him.
"
    It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
    To do the act that might the addition earn
    Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

  IAGO.
 'Tis but so, I warrant.
                      Trumpets within.


                           Enter Roderigo.
 With nought but truth.
 Well, go to, very well.

  RODERIGO.
 If she will return me my jewels, I will give over
    my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure
    yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
 You have said now.

  IAGO.
 Thou hast taken against me a most just
    exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy
    affair.
 I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
    not without wit and judgement.
 Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
    Cassio in Othello's place.

  RODERIGO.
 O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
    fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some
    accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
    Cassio.

  RODERIGO.
 Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
 He sups
    tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.

  RODERIGO.
 I will hear further reason for this.
 And you shall be satisfied.

  OTHELLO.
 O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA.
 It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,  
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
 I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA.

  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA.
                               No, unpin me here.
 He speaks well.
 Hark, who is't that knocks?
  EMILIA.
 O, these men, these men!
    Dost thou in conscience think- tell me, Emilia-
    That there be women do abuse their husbands
    In such gross kind?
  EMILIA.
 Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA.

  DESDEMONA.
 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA.

  EMILIA.
 Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
    For the whole world.
 Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
    world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you
    might quickly make it right.
 And doth affection breed it?

 SCENE I.

    Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.

    'Tis but a man gone.

  IAGO.
 Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain.

  CASSIO.
 That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
    But that my coat is better than thou know'st;
    I will make proof of thine.

  RODERIGO.


                            Enter Othello.
 O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO.
 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
 We do not know.
 This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

  LODOVICO.
 The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

  IAGO.

  RODERIGO.
 O, help me here!
  CASSIO.
 O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO.

  IAGO.

  IAGO.
 How is't, brother?
  CASSIO.


  BIANCA.
 I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
 O, for a chair,
    To bear him easily hence!
  BIANCA.
 Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
    To be a party in this injury.
 Come, come;
    Lend me a light.
 Know we this face or no?  
    Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
    Roderigo? No- yes, sure.
 O heaven! Roderigo.
 What, of Venice?
  IAGO.
 Even he, sir.

  IAGO.

  GRATIANO.

  IAGO.
 Roderigo!
  IAGO.
 Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.

    Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.

  EMILIA.
                      As I! foh! fie upon thee!
  IAGO.


Enter Othello.
 It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.

    Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
                         Ay, Desdemona.

  DESDEMONA.
 Ay, I do.
 Then heaven have mercy on me!  
  OTHELLO.
 Why I should fear I know not,
    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

  DESDEMONA.

  DESDEMONA.

  DESDEMONA.
                               I say, amen.

  DESDEMONA.

  OTHELLO.
 Down, strumpet!
  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA.
] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
  OTHELLO.
                                      Who's there?
  EMILIA.
 Ha! no more moving?
    Still as the grave.
] I do beseech you
    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
  OTHELLO.
 I had forgot thee.

    Where art thou?                                 Unlocks the door.
 What, now?
  EMILIA.

  EMILIA.
 A guiltless death I die.

  EMILIA.
 Nobody; I myself.
 She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
 She was false as water.
                          Thou art rash as fire, to say
    That she was false.
 Thy husband.
  
    An honest man he is, and hates the slime
    That sticks on filthy deeds.
                             He, woman;
    I say thy husband.
 Dost understand the word?
    My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

    She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
 Do thy worst;
    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
    Than thou wast worthy her.
 Go to, charm your tongue.

    My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed-
  ALL.
 O heavens forfend!
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO.
 Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.

  MONTANO.
 O monstrous act!
  EMILIA.

    O villainy, villainy!
  IAGO.
 What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
 Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;
    'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

  OTHELLO.
] O, she was foul!
    I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece,
    Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.

    Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
    Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,
    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.
 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
    A thousand times committed.
 Cassio confess'd it,
    And she did gratify his amorous works
    With that recognizance and pledge of love
    Which I first gave her.

  EMILIA.
                         'Twill out, 'twill.
                          I will not.

  GRATIANO.

  IAGO.
                          Villainous whore!
  EMILIA.
 Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.

  GRATIANO.

    Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
    But kill him rather.
                       Dies.
] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
 What is the matter?
  OTHELLO.
 Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it.
 O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!
  
         Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair,
                  and Officers with Iago, prisoner.
 Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
  OTHELLO.
 I am not sorry neither.
 I'ld have thee live,
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

  LODOVICO.

    From this time forth I never will speak word.

    Your power and your command is taken off,
    And Cassio rules in Cyprus.
 For this slave,  
    If there be any cunning cruelty
    That can torment him much and hold him long,
    It shall be his.
 You shall close prisoner rest,
    Till that the nature of your fault be known
    To the Venetian state.
 Soft you; a word or two before you go.

    No more of that.
                   Exeunt.

 SCENE I.
 The palace

Enter RICHARD, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other NOBLES and attendants

  KING RICHARD.
 Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him
    If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,
    Or worthily, as a good subject should,
    On some known ground of treachery in him?
  GAUNT.
 Then call them to our presence: face to face
    And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear  
    The accuser and the accused freely speak.

    High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire,
    In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
 Many years of happy days befall
    My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
  MOWBRAY.
 First-heaven be the record to my speech!
    In the devotion of a subject's love,
    Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince,
    And free from other misbegotten hate,  
    Come I appellant to this princely presence.

    Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
    With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
    And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move,
    What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.

    By that and all the rites of knighthood else
    Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
    What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.

    He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
    Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
 Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.

    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
    Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers;
    The other part reserv'd I by consent,
    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
    Upon remainder of a dear account
    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
    Now swallow down that lie.

  KING RICHARD.
 Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;
    Let's purge this choler without letting blood-  
    This we prescribe, though no physician;
    Deep malice makes too deep incision.

    Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
    We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

  GAUNT.

  MOWBRAY.
 Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
    Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father's sight?
    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
    Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue  
    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
    Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
    The slavish motive of recanting fear,
    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
    The swelling difference of your settled hate;
    Since we can not atone you, we shall see
    Justice design the victor's chivalry.

    Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms
    Be ready to direct these home alarms.
                 Exeunt




SCENE 2.

  DUCHESS.
 Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
    Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
    Or seven fair branches springing from one root.
 Farewell, old Gaunt.

    I take my leave before I have begun,
    For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.

    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.

    Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;
    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
    I shall remember more.

  AUMERLE.
 When they are set,
     enter MOWBRAY, Duke of Nor folk, in arms, defendant, and
     a HERALD

  KING RICHARD.
 In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,  
    And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms;
    Against what man thou com'st, and what thy quarrel.
 My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
    Who hither come engaged by my oath-
    Which God defend a knight should violate!-
    Both to defend my loyalty and truth
    To God, my King, and my succeeding issue,
    Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me;
    And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
    To prove him, in defending of myself,
    A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
 Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford,
            appellant, in armour, and a HERALD

  KING RICHARD.
 Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
    Both who he is and why he cometh hither  
    Thus plated in habiliments of war;
    And formally, according to our law,
    Depose him in the justice of his cause.
 Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
    Am I; who ready here do stand in arms
    To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
    In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
    That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
    To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.

    Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
    So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
    Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
    Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.

    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
    To reach at victory above my head,
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,
    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
    That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat
    And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt,
    Even in the lusty haviour of his son.

  MARSHAL.
 Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
    Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,
    On pain to be found false and recreant,  
    To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
    A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
    And dares him to set forward to the fight.
 Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants.

    For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
    With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
    And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
    Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
    And for we think the eagle-winged pride
    Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
    With rival-hating envy, set on you
    To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
    Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
    Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums,
    With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
    And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
    Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
    And make us wade even in our kindred's blood-
    Therefore we banish you our territories.
 This must my comfort be-
    That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,
    And those his golden beams to you here lent
    Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

    A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
    As to be cast forth in the common air,
    Have I deserved at your Highness' hands.

    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
    Too far in years to be a pupil now.

  KING RICHARD.
 Return again, and take an oath with thee.
 I swear.
 Now no way can I stray:
    Save back to England, an the world's my way.
            Exit
  KING RICHARD.
 Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
    I see thy grieved heart.
 I thank my liege that in regard of me
    He shortens four years of my son's exile;
    But little vantage shall I reap thereby,
    For ere the six years that he hath to spend
    Can change their moons and bring their times about,
    My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
    Shall be extinct with age and endless night;  
    My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
    And blindfold death not let me see my son.
  
    Alas, I look'd when some of you should say
    I was too strict to make mine own away;
    But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
    Against my will to do myself this wrong.

  KING RICHARD.
 O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
    That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?
  BOLINGBROKE.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 What is six winters? They are quickly gone.

  BOLINGBROKE.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    Suppose the singing birds musicians,
    The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
    The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
    Than a delightful measure or a dance;
    For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
    The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
 O, who can hold a fire in his hand
    By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
    By bare imagination of a feast?
    Or wallow naked in December snow
    By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
    O, no! the apprehension of the good
    Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.
 Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way.
 We did observe.
 And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
  AUMERLE.
 He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
    When time shall call him home from banishment,
    Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.

    Ourself, and Bushy, Bagot here, and Green,
    Observ'd his courtship to the common people;
    How he did seem to dive into their hearts
    With humble and familiar courtesy;
    What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
    Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
    And patient underbearing of his fortune,
    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
 Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts!
    Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
    Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
    Ere further leisure yicld them further means
    For their advantage and your Highness' loss.
 If that come short,
    Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
    Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
    They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,
    And send them after to supply our wants;
    For we will make for Ireland presently.
 At Ely House.
 Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
    To help him to his grave immediately!
    The lining of his coffers shall make coats
    To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
 Amen.

ACT II.
 Will the King come, that I may breathe my last
    In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
  YORK.

  GAUNT.
 No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,  
    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
    Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
    The open ear of youth doth always listen;
    Report of fashions in proud Italy,
    Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
    Limps after in base imitation.

    'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
 Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;  
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.

    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.

    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

    Enter KING and QUEEN, AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT,
                Ross, and WILLOUGHBY

  YORK.

    The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
    Is my strict fast-I mean my children's looks;
    And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.
 No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
    Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
    I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
 No, no; men living flatter those that die.

  KING RICHARD.

    Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
    Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
    And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
    Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
    Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
    A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
    Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
    And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
    The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.

    Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
    It were a shame to let this land by lease;
    But for thy world enjoying but this land,
    Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
    Landlord of England art thou now, not King.

    My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul-
    Whom fair befall in heaven 'mongst happy souls!-
    May be a precedent and witness good
    That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood.

  YORK.
 I do beseech your Majesty impute his words
    To wayward sickliness and age in him.

  KING RICHARD.
 The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
 Now for our Irish wars.

    His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
    Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
    But when he frown'd, it was against the French
    And not against his friends.

    His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.

  YORK.
 Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;
    Bid him repair to us to Ely House
    To see this business.

    Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;
    Be merry, for our time of stay is short.

                   Flourish.
  
    Ross.
 Richly in both, if justice had her right.
 My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
    Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.
 Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
    In him, a royal prince, and many moe
    Of noble blood in this declining land.
 Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
    But basely yielded upon compromise
    That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows.
 Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.

  ROSS.
 His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!
    But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
    Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;  
    We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
 Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
    I spy life peering; but I dare not say
    How near the tidings of our comfort is.

Windsor Castle

Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT

  BUSHY.

  QUEEN.
 Yet again methinks
    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
    Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
    With nothing trembles.
 At some thing it grieves
    More than with parting from my lord the King.
 Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
    Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
    For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
    Divides one thing entire to many objects,  
    Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,
    Show nothing but confusion-ey'd awry,
    Distinguish form.

  QUEEN.
 Howe'er it be,
    I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
    As-though, on thinking, on no thought I think-
    Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

  BUSHY.
 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

    I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
 Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
    For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.
 Now God in heaven forbid!
  GREEN.
 Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
    The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,  
    The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
    With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
 So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
    And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir.

    Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy;
    And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
    Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

  BUSHY.
 Here comes the Duke of York.

  YORK.
 Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
 He was-why so go all which way it will!
    The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold
    And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.

    Hold, take my ring.

    What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
    How shall we do for money for these wars?
    Come, sister-cousin, I would say-pray, pardon me.

    T'one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
    And duty bids defend; t'other again
    Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd,
    Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
 All is uneven,
    And everything is left at six and seven.

    But none returns.

    The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

  BUSHY.

  BUSHY.
 I fear me, never.
                                Exeunt




SCENE 3.

Gloucestershire

Enter BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, forces

  BOLINGBROKE.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
    To offer service to the Duke of Hereford;
    And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover  
    What power the Duke of York had levied there;
    Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

  PERCY.
 I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
    I count myself in nothing else so happy
    As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends;
    And as my fortune ripens with thy love,
    It shall be still thy true love's recompense.
 There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,  
    Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
    And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour-
    None else of name and noble estimate.


                  Enter Ross and WILLOUGHBY

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 All my treasury
    Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enrich'd,
    Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
 Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
    Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
    Stands for my bounty.

  BERKELEY.

    To you, my lord, I come-what lord you will-
    From the most gracious regent of this land,
    The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
    To take advantage of the absent time,
    And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.
 Tut, tut!
    Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.

    My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold;
    And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
 It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
 My lords of England, let me tell you this:
    I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs,
    And labour'd all I could to do him right;
    But in this kind to come, in braving arms,  
    Be his own carver and cut out his way,
    To find out right with wrong-it may not be;
    And you that do abet him in this kind
    Cherish rebellion, and are rebels all.
 Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.

    But we must win your Grace to go with us  
    To Bristow Castle, which they say is held
    By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,
    The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
    Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
 It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
    For I am loath to break our country's laws.

A camp in Wales

Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a WELSH CAPTAIN

  CAPTAIN.

 Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
    The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.

 SCENE I.
 Lords, farewell.
 My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.

    Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
    Take special care my greetings be delivered.
 Come, lords, away,
    To fight with Glendower and his complices.
 A castle in view

Drums.
 Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,
AUMERLE, and soldiers

  KING RICHARD.
 How brooks your Grace the air
    After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
  KING RICHARD.
 Needs must I like it well.

    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
    Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.

    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.

    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose  
    The deputy elected by the Lord.

  AUMERLE.

    Is not the King's name twenty thousand names?
    Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
    At thy great glory.

    Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay-
    The worst is death, and death will have his day.

    White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
    Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
    Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints
    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
    Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
    Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
    Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
    And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

  KING RICHARD.

    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?
    What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?
    That they have let the dangerous enemy
    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.

    Let's choose executors and talk of wills;
    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath
    Save our deposed bodies to the ground?  
    Our lands, our lives, and an, are Bolingbroke's.

    And nothing can we can our own but death
    And that small model of the barren earth
    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.

    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground
    And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
    How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,
    Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,
    Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,
    All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
    That rounds the mortal temples of a king
    Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,
    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;
    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
    To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;
    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
    As if this flesh which walls about our life
    Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,
    Comes at the last, and with a little pin
    Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!  
    Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
    With solemn reverence; throw away respect,
    Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty;
    For you have but mistook me all this while.
 My father hath a power; inquire of him,
    And learn to make a body of a limb.

    This ague fit of fear is over-blown;  
    An easy task it is to win our own.

  KING RICHARD.

      [To AUMERLE] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
    Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
    What say you now? What comfort have we now?
    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
    That bids me be of comfort any more.
 Let no man speak again
    To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

  AUMERLE.

    Discharge my followers; let them hence away,
    From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
       Exeunt




SCENE 3.

  YORK.
  
  YORK.
 The heavens are over our heads.
 I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
    Against their will.
 But who comes here?

                    Enter PERCY

    Welcome, Harry.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.

      Enter on the walls, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,
      AUMERLE, SCROOP, and SALISBURY

    See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
    As doth the blushing discontented sun
    From out the fiery portal of the east,
    When he perceives the envious clouds are bent  
    To dim his glory and to stain the track
    Of his bright passage to the occident.
 Yet he looks like a king.
 Behold, his eye,
    As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
    Controlling majesty.

  KING RICHARD.

  AUMERLE.
 Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
 What must the King do now? Must he submit?
    The King shall do it.
 My lord, in the base court he doth attend
    To speak with you; may it please you to come down?
  KING RICHARD.

    In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
    To come at traitors' calls, and do them grace.
 What says his Majesty?
  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Sorrow and grief of heart
    Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man;
    Yet he is come.

  KING RICHARD.
 Exeunt




SCENE 4.
 What sport shall we devise here in this garden
    To drive away the heavy thought of care?
  LADY.
 Madam, we'll dance.

  QUEEN.

                                       [QUEEN and LADIES retire]
  GARDENER.
 O, what pity is it
    That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
    As we this garden! We at time of year
    Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,
    Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
    With too much riches it confound itself;
    Had he done so to great and growing men,
    They might have Ev'd to bear, and he to taste
    Their fruits of duty.

    Post you to London, and you will find it so;
    I speak no more than every one doth know.
 Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
    Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
    And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest
    To serve me last, that I may longest keep
    Thy sorrow in my breast.

    Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
    In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

    Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind-
    What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death;
    Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd
    The bloody office of his timeless end.
 Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Excepting one, I would he were the best
    In all this presence that hath mov'd me so.

    By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
    I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it,
    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
 Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
 I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
    And spur thee on with fun as many lies  
    As may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear
    From sun to sun.

  AUMERLE.
 Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!
    I have a thousand spirits in one breast
    To answer twenty thousand such as you.

  SURREY.
 My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
    The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

  FITZWATER.

  SURREY.
 How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!  
    If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
    I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
    And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,
    And lies, and lies.

    As I intend to thrive in this new world,
    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.

  AUMERLE.
 As surely as I live, my lord.
 Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
    Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
    Your differences shall all rest under gage
    Till we assign you to your days of trial

                 Enter YORK, attended

  YORK.
 In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

    What subject can give sentence on his king?
    And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
    Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear,
    Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
    And shall the figure of God's majesty,
    His captain, steward, deputy elect,
    Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
    Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath,
    And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,  
    That in a Christian climate souls refin'd
    Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
    I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
    Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king.

    O, if you raise this house against this house,
    It will the woefullest division prove
    That ever fell upon this cursed earth.

    Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
    Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe.

    May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit?
  BOLINGBROKE.
 Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
    He may surrender; so we shall proceed
    Without suspicion.

    Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
    To this submission.

    God save the King! although I be not he;
    And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
 To do that office of thine own good will
    Which tired majesty did make thee offer-
    The resignation of thy state and crown
    To Henry Bolingbroke.

  KING RICHARD.

    Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
    And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.

  KING RICHARD.

    Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me
    Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
    Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,
    Showing an outward pity-yet you Pilates
    Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
    And water cannot wash away your sin.
 Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.
 Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.

  KING RICHARD.
 Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
 The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
 I'll read enough,
    When I do see the very book indeed
    Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
 Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;
    For when I was a king, my flatterers
    Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
    I have a king here to my flatterer.
 You shall.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
  
  BOLINGBROKE.

  KING RICHARD.

  PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANY
SERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.


            Enter KING RICHARD and Guard

    But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
    My fair rose wither.
 What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
    Transform'd and weak'ned? Hath Bolingbroke depos'd
    Thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?
    The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
    And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
    To be o'erpow'r'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
    Take the correction mildly, kiss the rod,
    And fawn on rage with base humility,
    Which art a lion and the king of beasts?  
  KING RICHARD.

    Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.

    Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest,
    As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
 Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate  
    A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
    And then betwixt me and my married wife.

    Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
    And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.

  NORTHUMBERLAND.
 Aumerle that was
    But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
    And madam, you must call him Rudand now.


                  Enter AUMERLE

  DUCHESS.
 Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.

  AUMERLE.
 No matter, then, who see it.

  AUMERLE.
 I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;
    It is a matter of small consequence
    Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
 What should you fear?
    'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
    For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph-day.

  YORK.

    Boy, let me see the writing.
 Peace, foolish woman.
 I will unto the King.
 Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son
    I would appeach him.

  YORK.

    I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
    I doubt not but to ride as fast as York;
    And never will I rise up from the ground  
    Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee.
 Where is the King?
  BOLINGBROKE.
 [Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe.

  YORK.
 [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King.

  YORK.
 O King, believe not this hard-hearted man!
    Love loving not itself, none other can.

  YORK.
 Rise up, good aunt.
 Against them both, my true joints bended be.

                                                     [Kneels]
    Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
  DUCHESS.
 Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face;
    His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
    His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast.
  
    He prays but faintly and would be denied;
    We pray with heart and soul, and all beside.

  DUCHESS.

  BOLINGBROKE.

  BOLINGBROKE.

    They shall not live within this world, I swear,
    But I will have them, if I once know where.
 He spake it twice
    And urg'd it twice together, did he not?
  SERVANT.
 He did.

    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented.
 The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.
                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time.

    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
 So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.

    This music mads me.
 So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
    That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
    This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.


              Enter KEEPER with meat

  KEEPER.
 If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.

 Exit
  KEEPER.
 My lord, I dare not.
 Exton, thy fierce hand
    Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land.

    Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
    Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

    This dead King to the living King I'll bear.

Windsor Castle

         Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE

  PERCY.
 Herein all breathless lies
    The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
    Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
 Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
    A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
    Upon my head and all this famous land.

  BOLINGBROKE.
 Though I did wish him dead,
    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.

 A street

Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus

  GLOUCESTER.

    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-  
    I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
    Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
    And that so lamely and unfashionable
    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
    Have no delight to pass away the time,
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
    And descant on mine own deformity.


             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY

    Brother, good day.
 Because my name is George.
 Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
 By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds  
    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.

    I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
    If we will keep in favour with the King,
    To be her men and wear her livery:
    The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
    Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.

    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
  BRAKENBURY.

  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Meantime, have patience.
 I must perforce.
 Farewell.

    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
    If heaven will take the present at our hands.
 As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
    Well are you welcome to the open air.

  GLOUCESTER.
 What news abroad?
  HASTINGS.
 No news so bad abroad as this at home:
    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
    And his physicians fear him mightily.

Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it;
LADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY

  ANNE.
 Set down, set down your honourable load-
    If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
    Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
    Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.

    Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
    I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.

                                [The bearers take up the coffin]

                      Enter GLOUCESTER  

  GLOUCESTER.

  ANNE.
 My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
    pass.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
  
  ANNE.
 Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
 Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

  ANNE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
    That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
 The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
    him.
 Let him thank me that holp to send him
    thither,
    For he was fitter for that place than earth.

  GLOUCESTER.
 So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
 I hope so.
 Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.

  ANNE.
 His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

  GLOUCESTER.

      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
 Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
  ANNE.

  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.
 I fear me both are false.

  GLOUCESTER.

  GLOUCESTER.

  ANNE.
 Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
               [Puts on the ring]
  GLOUCESTER.

    And if thy poor devoted servant may
    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
 That it may please you leave these sad designs
    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
    And presently repair to Crosby House;
    Where-after I have solemnly interr'd  
    At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
    I will with all expedient duty see you.

  ANNE.

  GLOUCESTER.
 No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.

    But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
    And then return lamenting to my love.
 Ah, he is young; and his minority
    Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Would all were well! But that will
    never be.

    I fear our happiness is at the height.
 They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.

    Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
    But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
    With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
  GREY.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
    Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
    Held in contempt; while great promotions
    Are daily given to ennoble those  
    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.

    My lord, you do me shameful injury
    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
 You may deny that you were not the mean
    Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Ay, and much better blood than his or
    thine.
 To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.

    I am too childish-foolish for this world.
 Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
    world,
    Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.

    So should we you, if you should be our king.
 As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
    You should enjoy were you this country's king,
    As little joy you may suppose in me
    That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
 Margaret!
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Richard!
  GLOUCESTER.
 I call thee not.
 Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my  
    fortune!
    Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
    Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
    Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.

    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
    To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.

  RIVERS.

    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
  DORSET.

    O, that your young nobility could judge  
    What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
    They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
    And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
 Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
  
  QUEEN MARGARET.
 Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
 A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
    To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
  GLOUCESTER.
 Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
 We wait upon your Grace.

    warrant,
    That we may be admitted where he is.

SCENE 4.

    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
    All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
    Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.

                  Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant

  BRAKENBURY.
 Ho! who's here?
  BRAKENBURY.
 I would speak with Clarence, and I came
    hither on my legs.

                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]
  BRAKENBURY.
 I am, in this, commanded to deliver
    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom.

  SECOND MURDERER.
 Why, he shall never wake until the great
    judgment-day.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 So I am, to let him live.
 Nay, I prithee, stay a little.

  FIRST MURDERER.

  SECOND MURDERER.
 When he opens his purse to give us our
    reward, thy conscience flies out.
 Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
    persuading me not to kill the Duke.

  SECOND MURDERER.
 Come, shall we fall to work?
  FIRST MURDERER.

  SECOND MURDERER.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
 But not as I am, royal.
 Nor you as we are, loyal.
 My voice is now the King's, my looks
    mine own.

    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
  FIRST MURDERER.

    The deed you undertake is damnable.
 Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
    Hath in the tables of his law commanded
    That thou shalt do no murder.
 And like a traitor to the name of God
    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
 How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
    to us,
    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
  CLARENCE.

    If God will be avenged for the deed,
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.

  FIRST MURDERER.
 Tell him when that our princely father York
    Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
    And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
    He little thought of this divided friendship.
  
  FIRST MURDERER.
 O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
 Come, you
    deceive yourself:
    'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
 Have you that holy feeling in your souls
    To counsel me to make my peace with God,
    And are you yet to your own souls so blind
    That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
    O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that.

                                              Exit with the body
  SECOND MURDERER.

 Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
    Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
    You have been factious one against the other.

    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
    And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
 There, Hastings; I will never more
    remember
    Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
  KING EDWARD.

  DORSET.
 This interchange of love, I here protest,
    Upon my part shall be inviolable.
 A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.

  KING EDWARD.
 A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
  KING EDWARD.

  KING EDWARD.
 Then say at once what is it thou requests.

  KING EDWARD.

    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
    Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
    And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
    Who told me, when we both lay in the field
    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
    Even in his garments, and did give himself,
    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
    Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
    Had so much race to put it in my mind.
 Mark'd you not
    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
    O, they did urge it still unto the King!  
    God will revenge it.
 We wait upon your Grace.

  DAUGHTER.
 My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
    I do lament the sickness of the King,
    As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
    It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

    God will revenge it; whom I will importune
    With earnest prayers all to that effect.

  DAUGHTER.
 Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
    weep,
    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
    I'll join with black despair against my soul
    And to myself become an enemy.

  EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.

  DUCHESS.

    All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
    That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
    May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!  
    Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
  CHILDREN.

    She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
    I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.

    These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
    I for an Edward weep, so do not they.

 Why with some little train, my Lord of  
    Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM.

 I hope the King made peace with all of us;
    And the compact is firm and true in me.
 And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
 And so say I.

London.

    The weary way hath made you melancholy.
 My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet
    you.
 And, in good time, here comes the sweating
    Lord.
 The tender Prince
    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
    But by his mother was perforce withheld.

    The benefit thereof is always granted
    To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
    And those who have the wit to claim the place.

    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter
    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
    For the instalment of this noble Duke
    In the seat royal of this famous isle?
  CATESBY.
 He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
    Catesby,
    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
    How he doth stand affected to our purpose;  
    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
    To sit about the coronation.

  HASTINGS.
  [Within]  Who knocks?
  MESSENGER.

  HASTINGS.

    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
    And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
    To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.

    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
    And we will both together to the Tower,
    Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

 Exit

                         Enter CATESBY

  CATESBY.

  HASTINGS.
 I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
    shoulders
    Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.

    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
  CATESBY.

  HASTINGS.

    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
    I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.

  CATESBY.
 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
    When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
 Wot you what, my
    Lord?
    To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.
 I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now  
    Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
    By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
    This day those enernies are put to death,
    And I in better state than e'er I was.

RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death

  RIVERS.

  GREY.
 God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
    A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.

  RIVERS.
 Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
    When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,  
    For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
 Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

  BISHOP OF ELY.

  BUCKINGHAM.
  
  HASTINGS.
 I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
    But for his purpose in the coronation
    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
    His gracious pleasure any way therein.
 Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.

                                               [Takes him aside]
    Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
    And finds the testy gentleman so hot
    That he will lose his head ere give consent
    His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
    Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

                                Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
  DERBY.
 We have not yet set down this day of triumph.

    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
    For I myself am not so well provided
    As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
 Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
    I have sent for these strawberries.

    I think there's never a man in Christendom
    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
 I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
    That do conspire my death with devilish plots  
    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
    Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  HASTINGS.

  HASTINGS.

    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.

    Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
 The Tower-walls

Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured

  GLOUCESTER.
 Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
    thy colour,
    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
    And then again begin, and stop again,
    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
  BUCKINGHAM.
 He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

  BUCKINGHAM.

    So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue  
    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
    I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-
    He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.

  MAYOR.

  GLOUCESTER.

  BUCKINGHAM.
           Exit
  GLOUCESTER.

    [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker.
 Bid them both
    Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.

    And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
    Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
    The precedent was full as long a-doing;
    And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
    Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.

    Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros
    That cannot see this palpable device?
    Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?
    Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
    When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.


London.

  GLOUCESTER.

    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
    And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
 What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
    they not speak?
    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
  BUCKINGHAM.
 Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
    knocks.


                         Enter CATESBY

    Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
  CATESBY.
          Exit
  BUCKINGHAM.

    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
    And so once more return and tell his Grace.

                      CATESBY returns

  MAYOR.
 See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
  BUCKINGHAM.

  GLOUCESTER.
 Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

  GLOUCESTER.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Know then, it is your fault that you resign
    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
    The scept'red office of your ancestors,  
    Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
    The lineal glory of your royal house,
    To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
    Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
    Which here we waken to our country's good,
    The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
    Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
    And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.

  GLOUCESTER.

    But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-
    And much I need to help you, were there need.
 Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
 Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
    I am unfit for state and majesty.

  GLOUCESTER.
 O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.

                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens
  CATESBY.

    If you deny them, all the land will rue it.


                  Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest

    Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
    Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
    To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
    I must have patience to endure the load;
    But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
    Attend the sequel of your imposition,
    Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
    From all the impure blots and stains thereof;  
    For God doth know, and you may partly see,
    How far I am from the desire of this.

    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Ah, cut my lace asunder
    That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
    Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
  ANNE.
  
    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.

    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
    And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
    Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

    Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
    You shall have letters from me to my son
    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.

    Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
'
    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
    Within so small a time, my woman's heart
    Grossly grew captive to his honey words
    And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,  
    Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
    For never yet one hour in his bed
    Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
    But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 Say on, my loving lord.

  KING RICHARD.
 Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.

    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.
  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he
    gnaws his lip.
 I know a discontented gentleman
    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
 His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
    [Stands apart]
  KING RICHARD.

  TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

  TYRREL.
 Let me have open means to come to them,
    And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

                    Re-enter BUCKINGHAM

    BUCKINGHAM.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 I hear the news, my lord.

  KING RICHARD.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 I do remember me: Henry the Sixth
    Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,
    When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
 My lord-
  KING RICHARD.
 How chance the prophet could not at that
    time
    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
  BUCKINGHAM.
 My lord-
  KING RICHARD.
 Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the
    stroke
    Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.

    I am not in the giving vein to-day.

  BUCKINGHAM.
 The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
    The most arch deed of piteous massacre
    That ever yet this land was guilty of.

    'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
    'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
    Within their alabaster innocent arms.
 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
  TYRREL.

  KING RICHARD.
 My lord!
  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.

    Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
    To watch the waning of mine enemies.
 Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
    Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
    Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
    Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]
    Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.
  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be
    most reverend,
    Give mine the benefit of seniory,
    And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.

    I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:
    Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
 I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
    I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

  QUEEN MARGARET.
  
    From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
    A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
  
    Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
    And left thee but a very prey to time,
    Having no more but thought of what thou wast
    To torture thee the more, being what thou art.

    Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;
    These English woes shall make me smile in France.

    Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;
    Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
 Thy woes will make them sharp and
    pierce like mine.
 Why should calamity be fun of words?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 If so, then be not tongue-tied.
 O, she that might have intercepted thee,  
    By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
    From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
    crown
    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
    And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
  DUCHESS.
 Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
    Clarence?
    And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

 Though far more cause, yet much less

 advancement of your children, gentle  
    lady.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
    Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
    Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  KING RICHARD.
 Even all I have-ay, and myself and all
    Will I withal endow a child of thine;
    So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
    Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
    Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
 Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
 That would I learn of you,
    As one being best acquainted with her humour.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 And wilt thou learn of me?
  KING RICHARD.
 Madam, with all my heart.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

    If this inducement move her not to love,
    Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
    Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,

  KING RICHARD.

    If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
    To quicken your increase I will beget
    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.

    Your children were vexation to your youth;
    But mine shall be a comfort to your age.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Which she shall purchase with
    still-lasting war.
  
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  KING RICHARD.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
 An honest tale speeds best being plainly
    told.

  KING RICHARD.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  KING RICHARD.

  KING RICHARD.
 I swear-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.

  KING RICHARD.
 Now, by the world-  
  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 God's wrong is most of all.

    What canst thou swear by now?
  KING RICHARD.
 As I intend to prosper and repent,
    So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
    Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
    Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
    Be opposite all planets of good luck
    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
    Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
    I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.

  QUEEN ELIZABETH.
 Shall I forget myself to be myself?
  KING RICHARD.
 Write to me very shortly,
    And you shall understand from me her mind.
 Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

                 Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following

    How now! what news?
  RATCLIFF.
 Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
    Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
    Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.

  KING RICHARD.
                                            Exit
  RATCLIFF.
 Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
    What need'st thou run so many miles about,
    When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
    Once more, what news?
  STANLEY.

  STANLEY.
  
    I never was nor never will be false.

  KING RICHARD.
 My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
  KING RICHARD.
 I cry thee mercy.

    There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.

  FOURTH MESSENGER.
 Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis
    Dorset,
    'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.

    Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
    Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
    If they were his assistants, yea or no;
    Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
    Upon his party.

SCENE 2.

    In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
    To reap the harvest of perpetual peace  
    By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
 Then in God's name march.
 Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth
    field.

    My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
  SURREY.

    Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
  NORFOLK.
 Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

    Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
    Let us survey the vantage of the ground.

    Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
 Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
    Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
    His regiment lies half a mile at least
    South from the mighty power of the King.
 It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

  NORFOLK.
 My lord?  
  KING RICHARD.
 Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
    To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
    Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
    Into the blind cave of eternal night.

    I have not that alacrity of spirit
    Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
 Bid my guard watch; leave me.
  
  RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent
    And help to arm me.

    Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]

            Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD,
                    son to HENRY THE SIXTH

  GHOST.

    King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
 Awake and win the day.


                Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS

  GHOST.
  [To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
    And in a bloody battle end thy days!  
    Think on Lord Hastings.

    [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
    Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!

         Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES

  GHOSTS.
  [To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee
    to the crown;
    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.

            [The GHOSTS vanish.

    Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
 It is now dead midnight.

    Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.

    My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,  
    And every tongue brings in a several tale,
    And every tale condemns me for a villain.

    Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
    Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
    All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
    Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'
    I shall despair.
 Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
 Come, go with me;
    Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
    To see if any mean to shrink from me.


                 His ORATION to his SOLDIERS

    More than I have said, loving countrymen,
    The leisure and enforcement of the time
    Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
    God and our good cause fight upon our side;
    The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
    Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
    Richard except, those whom we fight against  
    Had rather have us win than him they follow.

    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt

           Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, attendants,
                         and forces

  KING RICHARD.
 He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.

    They thus directed, we will follow
    In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
    Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
 A good direction, warlike sovereign.

    Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;  
    Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
    Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe.

    Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.

    You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
    You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
    They would restrain the one, distain the other.

  KING RICHARD.
                 Exeunt




SCENE 4.
 Enter NORFOLK and forces; to him CATESBY

  CATESBY.
 Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
 Slave, I have set my life upon a cast
    And I Will stand the hazard of the die.

    I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
    Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
 God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;
    The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

  RICHMOND.
 Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
    But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.

    Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
    That long have frown'd upon their emnity!
    What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?
    England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
    The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
    The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
    The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire;
    All this divided York and Lancaster,
    Divided in their dire division,
    O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
    The true succeeders of each royal house,
    By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
    And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
    Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
    With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
    Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,  
    That would reduce these bloody days again
    And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
    Let them not live to taste this land's increase
    That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
    Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-
    That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt

 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are

 Therefore I will push Montague's men
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

 Yes, better, sir.

 Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
  Citizens.
 What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
 Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.


  Prince.

    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.

 O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
 See, where he comes.

  Mon.

  Rom.
 But new struck nine.

  Ben.

  Rom.

    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.

    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.

  Ben.

    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
 Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
  Rom.

    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

  Ben.
 'Tis the way
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.

    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.

    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Farewell.





Scene II.


Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
 Of honourable reckoning are you both,
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.

    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
  Cap.

  Cap.

    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house.
 Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

  Serv.
'

    [Gives back the paper.

  Rom.
 Whose house?
  Serv.

  Ben.

    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

Capulet's house.
 Nurse, come back again;
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
 Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

  Wife.
'
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.

  Nurse.
 Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    I came to talk of.

  Nurse.

  Wife.

  Wife.
 Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.

  Nurse.
 Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
  Jul.
 We follow thee.

    Juliet, the County stays.

                                                         Exeunt.

A street.


Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers.

  Mer.
 And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
 A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;  
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

  Mer.
 Why, may one ask?
  Rom.
 I dreamt a dream to-night.
 And so did I.

  Rom.

    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.

    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again.

  Rom.
 Strike, drum.

                           They march about the stage.

Capulet's house.
 When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands,
    and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
 Serv.
 Ay, boy, ready.

  1.


    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
 Am I come near ye now?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    Such as would please.

    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.

    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
 By'r Lady, thirty years.

  Cap.

  Rom.

  Rom.

    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.

    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.

  Tyb.

    What, goodman boy? I say he shall.
 I know what.
 Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
 O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
 You kiss by th' book.

  Rom.

  Ben.
 What's he that now is going out of door?
  Nurse.
 His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    The only son of your great enemy.
 A rhyme I learnt even now
    Of one I danc'd withal.
'
  Nurse.
 Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.

Exit.


Enter Romeo alone.
 Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
]

                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.

  Mer.

  Ben.
 Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
  
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
 If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.





Scene II.

    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    O that she knew she were!
    She speaks, yet she says nothing.

    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!
  Jul.
 She speaks.

    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title.
 What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    So stumblest on my counsel?
  Rom.
 By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
 My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.

  Jul.
  
  Rom.

  Jul.

  Jul.
 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
  Rom.
 Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

  Rom.

    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
 A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
 Romeo!
  Rom.

  Jul.
 Let me stand here till thou remember it.

  Jul.

 Exit




Scene III.
 The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
 Benedicite!
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Young son, it argues a distempered head  
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
 That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

  Friar.
 Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
 O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.

A street.


Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
 Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

  Ben.
 Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being
    dared.
 Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft;
    and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
  Ben.
 The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these
    new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very tall
    man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand so
    much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    bench? O, their bones, their bones!

                               Enter Romeo.
 Good morrow to you both.
 What counterfeit did I give you?
  Mer.
 Meaning, to cursy.
 Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

  Rom.
 Pink for flower.

  Rom.

  Mer.
 O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    narrow to an ell broad!
  Rom.

  Ben.

  Rom.

  Nurse.

  Mer.
 Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of  
    the two.
 God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
 Out upon you! What a man are you!
  Rom.
 By my troth, it is well said.
 Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
    wisely.
 If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

  Mer.
 What hast thou found?
  Mer.

                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
 And thou must stand
    by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
  Peter.
 Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much.
 Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
 What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  Nurse.
 I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
 Commend me to thy lady.

  Nurse.





Scene V.

    Perchance she cannot meet him.

  Nurse.
 Peter, stay at the gate.

  Nurse.

    Nay, come, I pray thee speak.
 Good, good nurse, speak.
 Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
    choose a man.
 Go thy ways, wench; serve God.

    What says he of our marriage? What of that?
  Nurse.

    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
  Jul.
 Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where is
    your mother?
  Jul.
 Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
 I have.
 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
 Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.


                     Enter Juliet.
  

    Here comes the lady.

  Jul.

ACT III.

    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

  Mer.
 Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    moved.

  Ben.
 Thou hast quarrell'd with a man
    for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that
    hath lain asleep in the sun.
 Didst thou not fall out with a
    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with another
    for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
    tutor me from quarrelling!
  Ben.
 By my head, here come the Capulets.

  Tyb.
 Follow me close, for I will speak to them.

  Mer.
 Zounds, consort!
  Ben.

  Mer.

    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,

  Tyb.

  Tyb.

  Rom.
 I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
 Will you pluck your sword out of
    his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears
    ere it be out.
                                    [Draws.
]
  Rom.

    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.

    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
 What, art thou hurt?
  Mer.
 The hurt cannot be much.
 I have it,
    And soundly too.
 Your houses!
                                 [Exit.

  Rom.
 This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
    This but begins the woe others must end.


  Ben.
 Romeo, away, be gone!
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
 O, I am fortune's fool!
  Ben.

                      Enter Citizens.


  Citizen.


  Prince.
 O noble Prince.
 Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.

    O cousin, cousin!
  Prince.
 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
  Ben.

    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
 He is a kinsman to the Montague;  
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.

    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.

    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
  Mon.

    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.


  Jul.

    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.

    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.

    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;  
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
 Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  Nurse.
 O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
  Jul.
 I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.

    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    All in gore-blood.

    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.

    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.

    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
  
  Jul.
 I'll find Romeo
    To comfort you.

Friar Laurence's cell.


                         Enter Romeo.


  Rom.
 Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
 Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
    For exile hath more terror in his look,  
    Much more than death.
 'Tis torture, and not mercy.
 More validity,  
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion flies than Romeo.
 I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
 Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    It helps not, it prevails not.

  Rom.

                                                 Knock [within].
 Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thou wilt be taken.
 (rises) Nurse-
  Nurse.

  Rom.
 O, tell me, friar, tell me,  
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
    The hateful mansion.
 Hold thy desperate hand.

    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Thou hast amaz'd me.

    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
 There art thou happy.
 Commend me to thy lady,
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
 Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
  
  Rom.
 Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
 Farewell; good night.
 But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.

                                                         Exeunt.
 Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.

    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
 These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
 I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
 Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love.

  Cap.
 Well, get you gone.


  Jul.

    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
 Madam!

 Nurse?

 Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
 Adieu, adieu!
Exit.

  Lady.

  
  Lady.
 Why, how now, Juliet?
  Jul.
  
  Jul.
 I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.


  Cap.
  
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
  Jul.

    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

  Cap.

    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
 I'll not be forsworn.
         Exit.
 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.

  Jul.
 O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.

    How shall that faith return again to earth
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
 And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.

  Jul.

  Nurse.
 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

 You say you do not know the lady's mind.

    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
 Happily met, my lady and my wife!
  Jul.
 That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

  Friar.

  Par.
 I will confess to you that I love him.
 If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

  Jul.
 Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
 It may be so, for it is not mine own.

    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise  
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
 Hold, daughter.

  Friar.
 Hold, then.
 Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

    Farewell, dear father.





Scene II.
 You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick
    their fingers.

  Cap.
 How canst thou try them so?
  Serv.
 Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
    fingers.
 Send for the County.

  Cap.
 Stand up.
 There is time enough.

    'Tis now near night.

    I'll play the housewife for this once.

Juliet's chamber.
 Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    In this so sudden business.

    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.

    I'll call them back again to comfort me.


        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.

Capulet's house.
 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.


  Cap.
 Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
 [Exit Fellow.

  Fellow.

    I hear him near.
  
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
 Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
 God forgive me!
    Marry, and amen.
 Will it not be?
                                     [Draws aside the curtains.

    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    I must needs wake you.
 Lady! lady! lady!
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    O weraday that ever I was born!
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!  

                           Enter Mother.
 What noise is here?
  Nurse.


  Father.
 For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

    Death lies on her like an untimely frost  
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
 Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.


  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
 Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
  Cap.
 Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death

 I will then give it you soundly.

 I'll re you, I'll fa you.

                                                         Exeunt.
 If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.

    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.

  Man.
 Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    And presently took post to tell it you.
 Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
    Thou knowest my lodging.

  Man.

    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
  Man.
 I'll be with thee straight.
 Meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
 There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.

    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

                                                         Exeunt.

Verona.


  John.
 Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!

                      Enter Friar Laurence.

    Welcome from Mantua.
 Going to find a barefoot brother out,
    One of our order, to associate me
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

  Laur.
 Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
 Now, must I to the monument alone.

Verona.
 A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.

    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.

    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.


  Rom.

  Bal.
 I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
 So shalt thou show me friendship.

    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.

  Bal.
 [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
]
  Rom.

    Stay not, be gone.

  Par.
 Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
                                                     They fight.
 Paris falls.

  Par.
 O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
                   [Dies.

    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    What said my man when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.

    Thou art not conquer'd.

    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    Forgive me, cousin.
 It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.
 Full half an hour.
 Go with me to the vault.

  Friar.
 Fear comes upon me.
 As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.
]
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.

  Jul.

    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    And Paris too.
 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
 [within] Lead, boy.
 O happy dagger!
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.
 There, where the torch doth burn.

    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
]
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry.

  3.

    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.


  Cap.
 O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
  Wife.
 Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
 Look, and thou shalt see.

  Mon.
 O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
    To press before thy father to a grave?
  Prince.
 Meantime forbear,
    And let mischance be slave to patience.

  Friar.

  Prince.

  Friar.

    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.

    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,  
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris.

    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Return'd my letter back.
 Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.

    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
 I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place, to this same monument.
 This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
 O brother Montague, give me thy hand.

  Mon.

                                                   Exeunt omnes.

  HOSTESS.
 Look in the
    chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror.
 Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law.

    I'll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.
 Enter a LORD from bunting, with his train

  LORD.

  FIRST HUNTSMAN.

  LORD.
 O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
    Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!  
    Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.

    What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
    Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
    A most delicious banquet by his bed,
    And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
    Would not the beggar then forget himself?
  FIRST HUNTSMAN.
 Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.

    Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
    Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
    And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
    Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
    And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
    Procure me music ready when he wakes,
    To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
    And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
    And with a low submissive reverence
    Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
    Let one attend him with a silver basin  
    Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
    Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
    And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
    Some one be ready with a costly suit,
    And ask him what apparel he will wear;
    Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
    And that his lady mourns at his disease;
    Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
    And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
    For he is nothing but a mighty lord.

  LORD.


                         Re-enter a SERVINGMAN

    How now! who is it?
  SERVANT.

  LORD.
 With all my heart.
 This fellow I remember
    Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
    'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.
 I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
     Exit a SERVINGMAN
    I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
    Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;
    I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';
    And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
    When they do homage to this simple peasant.
 I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship.
 Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear,
    for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than
    legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet than
    shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
  [Taking a pot of ale]
    Here's-
  THIRD SERVANT.

    Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,            [Music]
    And twenty caged nightingales do sing.

    Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
    Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
    On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.

    Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
    Above the morning lark.

  SECOND SERVANT.

  LORD.
 We'll show thee lo as she was a maid
    And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
    As lively painted as the deed was done.
 Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
    Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds  
    And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
    So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
 And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
    Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
    She was the fairest creature in the world;
    And yet she is inferior to none.

  SLY.

    Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
    And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
 These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.

    But did I never speak of all that time?
  FIRST SERVANT.
 Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
    Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
    As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
    And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
    And twenty more such names and men as these,
    Which never were, nor no man ever saw.

  SLY.
  

           Enter the PAGE as a lady, with ATTENDANTS

  SLY.
 Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
  SLY.
 Madam.
 'Tis much.
 Servants, leave me and her alone.

                                                 Exeunt SERVANTS
    Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
 Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
    To pardon me yet for a night or two;
    Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
 Marry, I will; let them play it.

    Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
    Gave me my being and my father first,
    A merchant of great traffic through the world,
    Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
    Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
    It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
    To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.

    And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,  
    Virtue and that part of philosophy
    Will I apply that treats of happiness
    By virtue specially to be achiev'd.

    Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
    And am to Padua come as he that leaves
    A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
    And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
 Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
    I am in all affected as yourself;
    Glad that you thus continue your resolve
    To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

    No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
    In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

    If either of you both love Katherina,  
    Because I know you well and love you well,
    Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
 To cart her rather.

  KATHERINA.
 And me, too, good Lord!
  TRANIO.

    Peace, Tranio!  
  TRANIO.

  GREMIO.
 Katherina, you may stay;
    For I have more to commune with Bianca.
 Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
    What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,
    I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!          Exit
  GREMIO.
 You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
    here's none will hold you.
 SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray.

  GREMIO.
 A husband? a devil.
 I say a devil.
 I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this
    condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
 I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
    That love should of a sudden take such hold?
  LUCENTIO.
 Master, it is no time to chide you now;
    Affection is not rated from the heart;
    If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
    'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.
 Gramercies, lad.
 Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.

  LUCENTIO.
 O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
    Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
    That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
    When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
 I have it, Tranio.
 Master, for my hand,
    Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

  TRANIO.

    When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
    But in all places else your master Lucentio.
 Tranio, let's go.

    One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
    To make one among these wooers.
 My lord, 'tis but begun.
 Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
 Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

                        Enter HORTENSIO

  HORTENSIO.

  GRUMIO.
 Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
 Such wind as scatters young men through the world
    To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
    Where small experience grows.

  GRUMIO.
 Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.

    Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an  
    aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though
    she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses.
 Why, nothing
    comes amiss, so money comes withal.

    Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
    That none shall have access unto Bianca
    Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.

    You understand me- over and beside
    Signior Baptista's liberality,
    I'll mend it with a largess.

    I promis'd to enquire carefully
    About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
    And by good fortune I have lighted well
    On this young man; for learning and behaviour
    Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
    And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.

  HORTENSIO.
 Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
 I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
    If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
 No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
  PETRUCHIO.
 O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
    But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
    You shall have me assisting you in all.
 I love no chiders, sir.
  [Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
 No; if without more words you will get you hence.
 That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
 Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
    Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
    And do as adversaries do in law-
    Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
 The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
                Exeunt

ACT Il.

  KATHERINA.

  BIANCA.
 Is't not Hortensio?
  BIANCA.

  KATHERINA.
 [Strikes her]  If that be jest, then an the rest was so.


                            Enter BAPTISTA

  BAPTISTA.
 What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see  
    She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
    I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
    And for your love to her lead apes in hell.

  BAPTISTA.

    God save you, gentlemen!
  PETRUCHIO.
 I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.

  GREMIO.
 Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.

  BAPTISTA.

    [To TRANIO]  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.

    May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?  
  TRANIO.

  BAPTISTA.

    Though little fire grows great with little wind,
    Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
 I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
    Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

  BAPTISTA.
 Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
  HORTENSIO.
 Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
    I love her ten times more than e'er I did.

    O, how I long to have some chat with her!
  BAPTISTA.

    Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
    Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
  PETRUCHIO.

    Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
    She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.

    Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
    As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.

    Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
    Then I'll commend her volubility,  
    And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.

    But here she comes; :Lnd.
now, Petruchio, speak.

  PETRUCHIO.

  PETRUCHIO.

  KATHERINA.

  PETRUCHIO.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
 A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
  KATHERINA.
 A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
 It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Then show it me.
 What, you mean my face?
  KATHERINA.
 Yet you are wither'd.
 Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.

    And therefore, setting all this chat aside,  
    Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
    That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
    And will you, nill you, I will marry you.

    Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
    For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
    Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
    Thou must be married to no man but me;
    For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
    Conformable as other household Kates.

  BAPTISTA.
 Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
    That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
 Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
  PETRUCHIO.

    I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
    We will have rings and things, and fine array;
    And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
 Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
    And venture madly on a desperate mart.
 The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
 No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
 And I am one that love Bianca more
    Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
 Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

  TRANIO.
 Sir, list to me:  
    I am my father's heir and only son;
    If I may have your daughter to my wife,
    I'll leave her houses three or four as good
    Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
    Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
    Besides two thousand ducats by the year
    Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.

    What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
  GREMIO.
 Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
    [Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.

    What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
  TRANIO.
 Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
    Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
    And twelve tight galleys.

  GREMIO.
 Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
    And she can have no more than all I have;
    If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
 That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
 Well, gentlemen,
    I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
    My daughter Katherine is to be married;
    Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
    Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
    If not, to Signior Gremio.

    And so I take my leave, and thank you both.

  GREMIO.
 But, wrangling pedant, this is
    The patroness of heavenly harmony.

  BIANCA.

  HORTENSIO.
 You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  LUCENTIO.

  LUCENTIO.
 Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

  HORTENSIO.
 I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
    I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
    But let it rest.
 Now, Licio, to you.

    Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
    That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

                                       Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT
  LUCENTIO.
 If once I find thee ranging,
  HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing.
  [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
    That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
    And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.

  KATHERINA.
 But, say, what to thine old news?
  BIONDELLO.

  TRANIO.
 I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
 Ay, that Petruchio came.
 Nay, by Saint Jamy,
             I hold you a penny,
             A horse and a man
             Is more than one,
             And yet not many.

  PETRUCHIO.
 Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
    Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
    Though in some part enforced to digress,
    Which at more leisure I will so excuse
    As you shall well be satisfied withal.

  PETRUCHIO.

  BAPTISTA.

              Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, BIONDELLO, and ATTENDENTS
  TRANIO.
 Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
    Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
    'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
    Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
    I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.


                           Re-enter GREMIO

    Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
  GREMIO.

  TRANIO.

  TRANIO.
 Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
 Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
    As if the vicar meant to cozen him.

    But after many ceremonies done
    He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
    He had been abroad, carousing to his mates  
    After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
    And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
    Having no other reason
    But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
    And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.

    And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
    And after me, I know, the rout is coming.

    I know you think to dine with me to-day,
    And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
    But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,  
    And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

  BAPTISTA.

    And, honest company, I thank you all
    That have beheld me give away myself
    To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.

  PETRUCHIO.
 It cannot be.
 Let me entreat you.

  KATHERINA.

    The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
    You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
    For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.

    'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
    That take it on you at the first so roundly.

  KATHERINA.
 Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.

    I see a woman may be made a fool
    If she had not a spirit to resist.

    Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
    I will be master of what is mine own-
    She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
    My household stuff, my field, my barn,
    My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
    And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
    That stops my way in Padua.
 Grumio,
    Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
    Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.

  LUCENTIO.
 Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
  BAPTISTA.

  GRUMIO.
 But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain
    on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand- thou
    shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot
    office?
  CURTIS.
 First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n
    out.
 How?
  GRUMIO.

  CURTIS.
                                  [Striking him]
  CURTIS.
 And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this cuff
    was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning.
 Now I begin:
    Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
    mistress-  
  CURTIS.
 What's that to thee?
  CURTIS.
 Are they all ready?
  CURTIS.
 They are.
 Call them forth.
 Why, she hath a face of her own.
 Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
 How near is our master?
  GRUMIO.
 E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
   Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

  PETRUCHIO.

                                                   [Strikes him]
    Be merry, Kate.
, at them]
    You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
    What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
 Peter, didst ever see the like?
  PETER.
                  Exeunt

                       Re-enter PETRUCHIO  

  PETRUCHIO.

    My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.

  HORTENSIO.

                                              [They stand aside]

               Enter BIANCA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO

  LUCENTIO.
 While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
 O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
    I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

    Nor a musician as I seem to be;
    But one that scorn to live in this disguise
    For such a one as leaves a gentleman
    And makes a god of such a cullion.

  TRANIO.

  TRANIO.
 Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

  BIANCA.
 Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
    That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
    To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

  TRANIO.

  LUCENTIO.
  
  TRANIO.
  [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all
    one.

  TRANIO.

    His name and credit shall you undertake,
    And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
    Look that you take upon you as you should.

    This, by the way, I let you understand:
    My father is here look'd for every day
    To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
    'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
 No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

  KATHERINA.
 'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
 I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.

    What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
  KATHERINA.
 A dish that I do love to feed upon.
 Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
 Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.

  GRUMIO.
 Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
                                                     [Beats him]
    That feed'st me with the very name of meat.

    Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
    That triumph thus upon my misery!
    Go, get thee gone, I say.
 Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.

    What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
    And all my pains is sorted to no proof.

  KATHERINA.
 Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
-
    Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!  
    Kate, eat apace.
 Come, let me have a bigger.
 When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
    And not till then.

  HORTENSIO.

  KATHERINA.
 I am no child, no babe.
 Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
    A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
    I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
  
  KATHERINA.

    What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
    Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
    Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
  [Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
 You bid me make it orderly and well,
    According to the fashion and the time.
 Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
    I did not bid you mar it to the time.

  TAILOR.
 Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

  TAILOR.

  TAILOR.

  TAILOR.
  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
  GRUMIO.
  [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
  GRUMIO.

  TAILOR.

  GRUMIO.
 Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

    Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
    O fie, fie, fie!
  PETRUCHIO.
 Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
    Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
           Exit TAILOR  
  PETRUCHIO.

    Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
    And well we may come there by dinner-time.


                       Enter BIONDELLO

  PEDANT.
 Fear you not him.
 Set your countenance, sir.

    Right true it is your son Lucentio here
    Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
    Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
    And therefore, if you say no more than this,
    That like a father you will deal with him,
    And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
    The match is made, and all is done-
    Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

    There doth my father lie; and there this night
    We'll pass the business privately and well.

  BAPTISTA.
 It likes me well.
 I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
 Cambio.
 What say'st thou, Biondello?
  BIONDELLO.
 Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
    father of a deceitful son.
 And what of him?
  BIONDELLO.
 His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
 And what of all this?
  BIONDELLO.
 Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio
    ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk, and
    some sufficient honest witnesses.
 The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
 I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I say it is the moon.
  
    Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

  HORTENSIO.

  KATHERINA.
 Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
    That have been so bedazzled with the sun
    That everything I look on seemeth green;
    Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.

  PETRUCHIO.

  PETRUCHIO.
 I do assure thee, father, so it is.
         Exit

  LUCENTIO.
 I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at
    home, therefore leave us.
 I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
 Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
    My father's bears more toward the market-place;
    Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
 You shall not choose but drink before you go;
    I think I shall command your welcome here,  
    And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.
 Come hither, you rogue.

 Exit

 Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this

       Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS

  TRANIO.
 Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
  VINCENTIO.

  TRANIO.
 How now! what's the matter?
  BAPTISTA.
 Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but
    your words show you a madman.
 Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I
    wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to
    maintain it.

  BAPTISTA.
 Father Baptista, I charge you
    see that he be forthcoming.
 Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.

  BAPTISTA.
 Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.

    What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
    Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
 Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I
    will in to be revenged for this villainy.
 Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

                                      Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA

SCENE II.

LUCENTIO'S house

Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the PEDANT, LUCENTIO, BIANCA,
PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and WIDOW.

    Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
    And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
    Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
  
  HORTENSIO.
 Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
 YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
    I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
 Roundly replied.

  KATHERINA.

  WIDOW.
 Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
    Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
    And now you know my meaning.

  KATHERINA.
 To her, Kate!
  HORTENSIO.
 Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

  BIANCA.
 A good swift simile, but something currish.
 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
    'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

  BAPTISTA.
 Content.

  LUCENTIO.

  HORTENSIO.

  HORTENSIO.
 That will I.
 Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
 Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
    Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
    Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
    Say I command her come to me.
 I know her answer.
 The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.


                             Re-enter KATHERINA

  BAPTISTA.
 Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
 And so it is.

  PETRUCHIO.
 The more fool you for laying on my duty.
 Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
    What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

  PETRUCHIO.

    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
    And not obedient to his honest will,
    What is she but a foul contending rebel
    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
    I am asham'd that women are so simple
    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
    Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.

    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
    Unapt to toll and trouble in the world,  
    But that our soft conditions and our hearts
    Should well agree with our external parts?
    Come, come, you froward and unable worins!
    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
    My heart as great, my reason haply more,
    To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
    But now I see our lances are but straws,
    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.

    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
    And place your hands below your husband's foot;
    In token of which duty, if he please,
    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
 Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.

  VINCENTIO.
 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

  ANTONIO.
 He'll be hang'd yet,
    Though every drop of water swear against it,  
    And gape at wid'st to glut him.
 Let's take leave of him.
 If by your art, my dearest father, you have
    Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
 No harm.
 So,
                                          [Lays down his mantle]
    Lie there my art.

    Sit down, for thou must now know farther.
'
  PROSPERO.

    Obey, and be attentive.

  PROSPERO.
 Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
    She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
    Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
    And princess no worse issued.

    By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;
    But blessedly holp hither.

  PROSPERO.
 Being once perfected how to grant suits,
    How to deny them, who t' advance, and who
    To trash for over-topping, new created  
    The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
    Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
    Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state
    To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was
    The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
    And suck'd my verdure out on't.
 Thou attend'st not.

    I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
    To closeness and the bettering of my mind
    With that which, but by being so retir'd,
    O'er-priz'd all popular rate, in my false brother
    Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,
    Like a good parent, did beget of him
    A falsehood, in its contrary as great
    As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
    A confidence sans bound.
 He being thus lorded,
    Not only with what my revenue yielded,
    But what my power might else exact, like one
    Who having into truth, by telling of it,  
    Made such a sinner of his memory,
    To credit his own lie-he did believe
    He was indeed the Duke; out o' th' substitution,
    And executing th' outward face of royalty
    With all prerogative.

  MIRANDA.
 Now I arise.

  MIRANDA.
 Here cease more questions;
    Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dullness,  
    And give it way.

    I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak,
    Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
    I flam'd amazement.
 Sometime I'd divide,
    And burn in many places; on the topmast,
    The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,  
    Then meet and join Jove's lightning, the precursors
    O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
    And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
    Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
    Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,
    Yea, his dread trident shake.
 My brave spirit!
    Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
    Would not infect his reason?
  ARIEL.
 Not a soul
    But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd
    Some tricks of desperation.
  
  PROSPERO.
 Of the King's ship,
    The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,
    And all the rest o' th' fleet?
  ARIEL.

    What is the time o' th' day?
  ARIEL.

  ARIEL.
 Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
    Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd,
    Which is not yet perform'd me.
 How now, moody?
    What is't thou canst demand?
  ARIEL.
 Thou didst promise
    To bate me a full year.
 Where was she born?
    Speak; tell me.

  ARIEL.
 Sir, in Argier.

  PROSPERO.
 This damn'd witch Sycorax,
    For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
    To enter human hearing, from Argier
    Thou know'st was banish'd; for one thing she did
    They would not take her life.
 It was mine art,
    When I arriv'd and heard thee, that made gape
    The pine, and let thee out.
 I thank thee, master.
 If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
    And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till
    Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
 That's my noble master!
    What shall I do? Say what.
 Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea; be subject
    To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
    To every eyeball else.
 Shake it off.

  MIRANDA.

  PROSPERO.

  CALIBAN.
   [ Within]  There's wood enough within.
                         Exit
  PROSPERO.

  CALIBAN.

    This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
    Which thou tak'st from me.
 Thou most lying slave,
    Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us'd thee,
    Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodg'd thee
    In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
    The honour of my child.
 O ho, O ho! Would't had been done.
 Abhorred slave,
    Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
    Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
    Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
    One thing or other.
 When thou didst not, savage,
    Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
    A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
    With words that made them known.

  CALIBAN.
 No, pray thee.
 Sitting on a bank,
    Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
    This music crept by me upon the waters,  
    Allaying both their fury and my passion
    With its sweet air; thence I have follow'd it,
    Or it hath drawn me rather.
 But 'tis gone.

         Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
           [Burden: Ding-dong.
 The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
 This gallant which thou seest
    Was in the wreck; and but he's something stain'd
    With grief, that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
    A goodly person.
 I might call him
    A thing divine; for nothing natural
    I ever saw so noble.
 My prime request,
    Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
    If you be maid or no?
  MIRANDA.
 My language? Heavens!
    I am the best of them that speak this speech,
    Were I but where 'tis spoken.

  PROSPERO.
 O, if a virgin,
    And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
    The Queen of Naples.
 Soft, Sir! one word more.

    [Aside]  They are both in either's pow'rs; but this swift
    busines
    I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
    Make the prize light.

  MIRANDA.

  PROSPERO.
 What, I say,  
    My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
    Who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike, thy conscience
    Is so possess'd with guilt.

  PROSPERO.
 Foolish wench!
    To th' most of men this is a Caliban,
    And they to him are angels.

  MIRANDA.

  FERDINAND.
 So they are;
    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
 All corners else o' th' earth
    Let liberty make use of; space enough
    Have I in such a prison.

  PROSPERO.
-
    Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!  [To FERDINAND]  Follow
    me.

  ARIEL.
  [To MIRANDA]
    Speak not for him.
                                    Exeunt

 SCENE 1

Another part of the island

Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and OTHERS

  GONZALO.

  SEBASTIAN.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Sir-
  SEBASTIAN.
  
  GONZALO.

  GONZALO.
 You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
    should.
 Done.
 Yet-
  ANTONIO.
 Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
 True; save means to live.

  SEBASTIAN.

  GONZALO.
 The ground indeed is tawny.
 That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
    in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and
    glosses, being rather new-dy'd, than stain'd with salt
    water.

  ANTONIO.

  ANTONIO.
 Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
    as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of  
    your daughter, who is now Queen.

  ANTONIO.

  GONZALO.
 When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
  ALONSO.
 No, no, he's gone.
 Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
    That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
    But rather lose her to an African;
    Where she, at least, is banish'd from your eye,
    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

  ALONSO.

  GONZALO.

  SEBASTIAN.

  SEBASTIAN.
 And were the king on't, what would I do?
  SEBASTIAN.
 Scape being drunk for want of wine.

  GONZALO.
 All things in common nature should produce
    Without sweat or endeavour.

  ANTONIO.
 An it had not fall'n flat-long.

  GONZALO.
 We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
  
  ANTONIO.
 It is the quality o' th' climate.
  
  SEBASTIAN.
 Do you not hear me speak?
  SEBASTIAN.

  ANTONIO.
 Noble Sebastian,  
    Thou let'st thy fortune sleep-die rather; wink'st
    Whiles thou art waking.

  ANTONIO.
 Do so: to ebb,
    Hereditary sloth instructs me.

  ANTONIO.

  ANTONIO.
 A space whose ev'ry cubit
    Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel
    Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
    And let Sebastian wake.

  ANTONIO.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,
    'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
    This deity in my bosom; twenty consciences
    That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they  
    And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
    No better than the earth he lies upon,
    If he were that which now he's like-that's dead;
    Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
    Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
    To the perpetual wink for aye might put
    This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
    Should not upbraid our course.
 O, but one word.
 Then let us both be sudden.
 Now, good angels
    Preserve the King!                               [They wake]
  ALONSO.
 What's the matter?  
  SEBASTIAN.
 O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
    To make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar
    Of a whole herd of lions.
 Lead off this ground; and let's make further
    search
    For my poor son.

  GONZALO.
 Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
    weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it
    sing i' th' wind.
 What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John.
 Legg'd like a  
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
    thunderbolt.
  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My
    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no
    other shelter hereabout.
 Misery acquaints a man with
    strange bed-fellows.
 I will here shroud till the dregs
    of the storm be past.


            Enter STEPHANO singing; a bottle in his hand

  STEPHANO.

    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

    This is a scurvy tune too; but here's my comfort.
 O!
  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.
 He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
    wisest.
 Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
    I know it by thy trembling; now Prosper works upon thee.
 I should know that voice; it should be-but he is  
    drown'd; and these are devils.
 If all the wine in my bottle will recover
    him, I will help his ague.
 Come-Amen! I will pour some
    in thy other mouth.
 Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
    This is a devil, and no monster; I will leave him; I
    have no long spoon.
 And
    art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
    scap'd!
  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.

    That's a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.

  STEPHANO.

  STEPHANO.
 The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by
    th' seaside, where my wine is hid.
 Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man
    i' th' Moon, when time was.
 I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.
 My
    mistress show'd me thee, and thy dog and thy bush.

  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.
 A howling monster; a drunken monster!
  CALIBAN.
 No more dams I'll make for fish;
    Nor fetch in firing
    At requiring,
    Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.

    Freedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom, high-
    day, freedom!
  STEPHANO.
 O brave monster! Lead the way.
                Exeunt

ACT III.
 Miranda-O my father,
    I have broke your hest to say so!
  FERDINAND.
 Admir'd Miranda!
    What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
    I have ey'd with best regard; and many a time
    Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
    Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues
    Have I lik'd several women, never any
    With so full soul, but some defect in her
    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,  
    And put it to the foil; but you, O you,
    So perfect and so peerless, are created
    Of every creature's best!
  MIRANDA.

  MIRANDA.
 But this is trifling;  
    And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
    The bigger bulk it shows.
 To be your fellow
    You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
    Whether you will or no.

  MIRANDA.
 I'll to my book;
    For yet ere supper time must I perform  
    Much business appertaining.
                             Exit




SCENE 2

Another part of the island

Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO

  STEPHANO.
 Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
    water, not a drop before; therefore bear up, and board
    'em.

  TRINCULO.
 Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy
    eyes are almost set in thy head.
 Where should they be set else? He were a brave
    monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
 Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs, and
    yet say nothing neither.

  STEPHANO.
 Thou liest.

  STEPHANO.
 Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
    by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

  STEPHANO.
 Mum, then, and no more.

  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.
 What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
    I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
    And take his bottle from him.

  STEPHANO.

  STEPHANO.

  TRINCULO.
 Out o' your wits and
    hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! This can sack and
    drinking do.
 Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat
    him too.
 Come, proceed.

    And that most deeply to consider is
    The beauty of his daughter; he himself
    Calls her a nonpareil.
 Give me thy hand; I am sorry I beat thee; but
    while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy head.
 This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the
    picture of Nobody.

  TRINCULO.
 Mercy
    upon us!
  CALIBAN.
 That shall be by and by; I remember the story.
 Lead, monster; we'll follow.

  ANTONIO.
  [Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage  
    Will we take throughly.

  ANTONIO.
  [Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;
    For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
    Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
    As when they are fresh.
  [Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night; no more.
 A living drollery.

  ALONSO.
 I will stand to, and feed,
    Although my last; no matter, since I feel
    The best is past.
 Enter ARIEL, like a harpy;
       claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint
                device, the banquet vanishes  

  ARIEL.
 Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
    Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.
 My high charms work,
    And these mine enemies are all knit up
    In their distractions.
 They now are in my pow'r;
    And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
    Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
    And his and mine lov'd darling.
 Follow, I pray you.
  ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BE
DISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERS
PERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USED
COMMERCIALLY.
 O Ferdinand!
    Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
    For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,
    And make it halt behind her.

  PROSPERO.
 But
    If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
    All sanctimonious ceremonies may  
    With full and holy rite be minist'red,
    No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
    To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
    Sour-ey'd disdain, and discord, shall bestrew
    The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
    That you shall hate it both.

  PROSPERO.

    Incite them to quick motion; for I must
    Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
    Some vanity of mine art; it is my promise,
    And they expect it from me.

  ARIEL.

  PROSPERO.
 Her peacocks fly amain.

  IRIS.

  JUNO.
 Earth's increase, foison plenty,
    Barns and gamers never empty;
    Vines with clust'ring bunches growing,
    Plants with goodly burden bowing;
    Spring come to you at the farthest,
    In the very end of harvest!
    Scarcity and want shall shun you,
    Ceres' blessing so is on you.
 Sweet now, silence;
    Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.

    There's something else to do; hush, and be mute,
    Or else our spell is marr'd.
  

                      Enter certain NYMPHS

    You sun-burnt sicklemen, of August weary,
    Come hither from the furrow, and be merry;
    Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
    And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
    In country footing.
  [Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
    Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
    Against my life; the minute of their plot
    Is almost come.
 Never till this day
    Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
 We are such stuff
    As dreams are made on; and our little life
    Is rounded with a sleep.

    If you be pleas'd, retire into my cell  
    And there repose; a turn or two I'll walk
    To still my beating mind.
 I will plague them all,
    Even to roaring.

  
       Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c.

                          [PROSPERO and ARIEL remain, invisible]

         Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet

  CALIBAN.
 Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.
 Thou wert but a lost monster.

    Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
    Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly.
 There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
    that, monster, but an infinite loss.

  CALIBAN.

    Do that good mischief which may make this island
    Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
    For aye thy foot-licker.
 O King Stephano!
  STEPHANO.

  CALIBAN.
 I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment
    for't.
 I will have none on't.

  STEPHANO.
 Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this
    away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out
    of my kingdom.


          A noise of hunters beard.
 Hey, Mountain, hey!
  ARIEL.
 At this hour
    Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.
 I did say so,
    When first I rais'd the tempest.
 And mine shall.
 I'll fetch them, sir.
 But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd  
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.
 Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
    But yet thou shalt have freedom.
 Behold, Sir King,
    The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.
 Whe'er thou be'st he or no,
    Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
    As late I have been, I not know.
 Thy pulse
    Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
    Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which,
    I fear, a madness held me.

  GONZALO.

  PROSPERO.
 No.

  PROSPERO.

  PROSPERO.
 In this last tempest.
 I perceive these lords
    At this encounter do so much admire
    That they devour their reason, and scarce think
    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
    Are natural breath; but, howsoe'er you have
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain
    That I am Prospero, and that very duke
    Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely
    Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed
    To be the lord on't.

    My dukedom since you have given me again,
    I will requite you with as good a thing;
    At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
    As much as me my dukedom.


          Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA,
                      playing at chess

  MIRANDA.
 No, my dearest love,
    I would not for the world.
 Now all the blessings
    Of a glad father compass thee about!
    Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.

    I chose her when I could not ask my father
    For his advice, nor thought I had one.

  GONZALO.
 I have inly wept,
    Or should have spoke ere this.
 I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
  GONZALO.
  [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your
    hands.
 Be it so.
  [Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
  ALONSO.

  ARIEL.
 Thou  
    shalt be free.
 Coragio,
    bully-monster, coragio!
  TRINCULO.

  SEBASTIAN.
 Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
    Then say if they be true.
 This mis-shapen knave-
    His mother was a witch, and one so strong
    That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
    And deal in her command without her power.
 Why, how now, Stephano!
  STEPHANO.
 You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?
  STEPHANO.
 Go, sirrah, to my cell;
    Take with you your companions; as you look
    To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
 What a thrice-double ass
    Was I to take this drunkard for a god,
    And worship this dull fool!
  PROSPERO.
 Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
 Or stole it, rather.

  ALONSO.
 I long
    To hear the story of your life, which must
    Take the ear strangely.
  [Aside to ARIEL]  My Ariel,
      chick,
    That is thy charge.
 Let me not,
          Since I have my dukedom got,
          And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
          In this bare island by your spell;
          But release me from my bands
          With the help of your good hands.

          Gentle breath of yours my sails

Athens.

  PAINTER.

  POET.
 Ay, that's well known.

  PAINTER.
 O, pray let's see't.
 If he will touch the estimate.

  MERCHANT.

  JEWELLER.

  PAINTER.

  POET.
 'Tis a good piece.

  POET.
  
  PAINTER.
 How this lord is followed!
  POET.
 You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
 I will unbolt to you.

    You see how all conditions, how all minds-
    As well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as
    Of grave and austere quality, tender down
    Their services to Lord Timon.
 The base o' th' mount
    Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures
    That labour on the bosom of this sphere
    To propagate their states.

    This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
    With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
    Bowing his head against the steepy mount
    To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
    In our condition.
 When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
    Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,
    Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
    Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
    Not one accompanying his declining foot.
 'Tis common.

    Your honourable letter he desires
    To those have shut him up; which failing,
    Periods his comfort.
 Here, at your lordship's service.

  OLD ATHENIAN.
 I am a man
    That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,
    And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
    Than one which holds a trencher.
 The man is honest.

  OLD ATHENIAN.
  
    To build his fortune I will strain a little,
    For 'tis a bond in men.

  LUCILIUS.
 Never may
    That state or fortune fall into my keeping
    Which is not owed to you!
                                Exeunt LUCILIUS and OLD ATHENIAN
  POET.

    The painting is almost the natural man;
    For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,  
    He is but outside; these pencill'd figures are
    Even such as they give out.
 The gods preserve ye!
  TIMON.
 No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
    Which all men speak with him.
 Look who comes here; will you be chid?
  JEWELLER.
 We'll bear, with your lordship.

  MERCHANT.
 Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.
 Are they not Athenians?
  TIMON.

  JEWELLER.
 Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
 Thou art proud, Apemantus.

  APEMANTUS.
 Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
 That's a deed thou't die for.
 He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's
    but a filthy piece of work.
 An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.

  APEMANTUS.
 So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.

  TIMON.
 What dost thou think 'tis worth?
  APEMANTUS.
 Not worth my thinking.
 Then thou liest.
 Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
    labour.
 Ay.
 That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
 Ay, Apemantus.

  TIMON.
 When dinner's done
    Show me this piece.
 I am joyful of your sights.
 Right welcome, sir!
    Ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time
    In different pleasures.
 Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
 Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
  
  SECOND LORD.
 Hang thyself.
 He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
    Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
    Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
    But breeds the giver a return exceeding
    All use of quittance.

Then comes, dropping after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself

  VENTIDIUS.
 O, by no means,
    Honest Ventidius! You mistake my love;
    I gave it freely ever; and there's none
    Can truly say he gives, if he receives.
 A noble spirit!
  TIMON.
 Ho, ho, confess'd it! Hang'd it, have you not?
  TIMON.

    I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
 Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.
 Let it flow this way, my good lord.

    This and my food are equals; there's no odds.

  ALCIBIADES.

  TIMON.
 You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of
    friends.
 Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
    would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of
    our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
 O you gods, think I, what
    need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?
    They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne'er
    have use for 'em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung  
    up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves.

  THIRD LORD.
 I promise you, my lord, you mov'd me much.
 Much!                                [Sound tucket]
  TIMON.
 Ladies! What are their wills?
  SERVANT.
 There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears
    that office to signify their pleasures.
 Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
    That of his bounties taste! The five best Senses
    Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely
    To gratulate thy plenteous bosom.
 They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance.
 Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
    They dance? They are mad women.

    We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,
    And spend our flatteries to drink those men
    Upon whose age we void it up again
    With poisonous spite and envy.
 Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold
    taking, I doubt me.

  ALL LADIES.

                                         Exeunt CUPID and LADIES
  TIMON.
 My lord?
  TIMON.
 Here, my lord, in readiness.
 Look you, my good lord,
    I must entreat you honour me so much
    As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
    Kind my lord.


                       Enter a SERVANT

  SERVANT.

  TIMON.
 [Aside] What will this come to?
    He commands us to provide and give great gifts,
    And all out of an empty coffer;
    Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
    To show him what a beggar his heart is,
    Being of no power to make his wishes good.

    Well, would I were gently put out of office
    Before I were forc'd out!
    Happier is he that has no friend to feed
    Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
                           Exit
  TIMON.
 With more than common thanks I will receive it.
 I take all and your several visitations
    So kind to heart 'tis not enough to give;
    Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends
    And ne'er be weary.
 Alcibiades,
    Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.

    It comes in charity to thee; for all thy living
    Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
    Lie in a pitch'd field.
 Lights, more lights!
  FIRST LORD.
 Ready for his friends.

    Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.

    If I would sell my horse and buy twenty moe
    Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
    Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight,
    And able horses.
 Caphis, ho!
    Caphis, I say!

                         Enter CAPHIS
  
  CAPHIS.
 Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
  SENATOR.
 Get you gone;
    Put on a most importunate aspect,
    A visage of demand; for I do fear,
    When every feather sticks in his own wing,
    Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
    Which flashes now a phoenix.
 Never mind
    Was to be so unwise to be so kind.
 Now he comes from hunting.
 What, you come for money?
  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 Is't not your business too?
  CAPHIS.
 And yours too, Isidore?
  ISIDORE'S SERVANT.

  CAPHIS.
 Here comes the lord.
 Of Athens here, my lord.

  CAPHIS.

  TIMON.

    See them well entertain'd.

    Let's ha' some sport with 'em.
 A plague upon him, dog!
  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 No, 'tis to thyself.
 What are we, Apemantus?
  APEMANTUS.
 That you ask me what you are, and do not know
    yourselves.
 She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you
    are.

  APEMANTUS.

  PAGE.

    Answer not: I am gone.
 E'en so thou outrun'st grace.
 If Timon stay at home.
 So would I- as good a trick as ever hangman serv'd
    thief.
 Ay, fool.
 I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant.
 My mistress  
    is one, and I am her fool.

  VARRO'S SERVANT.

  APEMANTUS.

  VARRO'S SERVANT.
 I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman;
    sometime the philosopher.
 O my good lord,
    At many times I brought in my accounts,  
    Laid them before you; you would throw them off
    And say you found them in mine honesty.

  TIMON.

  FLAVIUS.
 The future comes apace;
    What shall defend the interim? And at length
    How goes our reck'ning?
  TIMON.

  FLAVIUS.

  TIMON.

  FLAVIUS.

    No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
    Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.

    Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack
    To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart:
    If I would broach the vessels of my love,
    And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
    Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
    As I can bid thee speak.

  FLAVIUS.
 Assurance bless your thoughts!
  TIMON.
 You shall perceive how you
    Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.

    Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!

           Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and another SERVANT
  
  SERVANTS.
 My lord! my lord!
  TIMON.

  FLAMINIUS.
 [Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!
  TIMON.

  TIMON.
 When he was poor,  
    Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,
    I clear'd him with five talents.

  FLAMINIUS.
 I thank you, sir.
 Fill me some wine.

  LUCULLUS.
 Here's to thee.
 Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
 Here's three solidares for thee.
 Is't possible the world should so much differ,
    And we alive that liv'd? Fly, damned baseness,
    To him that worships thee.

 Exit
  FLAMINIUS.
 May these add to the number that may scald thee!
    Let molten coin be thy damnation,
    Thou disease of a friend and not himself!
    Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
    It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
    I feel my master's passion! This slave
    Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him;
    Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
    When he is turn'd to poison?  
    O, may diseases only work upon't!
    And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
    Which my lord paid for be of any power
    To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit




SCENE II.
 But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
    which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours
    are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
 But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago
     one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many
    talents; nay, urg'd extremely for't, and showed what necessity
    belong'd to't, and yet was denied.
 I tell you, denied, my lord.
 See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see
    his honour.
 Servilius? You are kindly met, sir.
 Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord:
    he's ever sending.
 Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
    requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
    talents.

  LUCIUS.
 I know his lordship is but merry with me;
    He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.
 Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far
    as to use mine own words to him?
  SERVILIUS.
 Who can call him his friend
    That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,
    Timon has been this lord's father,
    And kept his credit with his purse;
    Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
    Has paid his men their wages.

  FIRST STRANGER.
 But I perceive
    Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
    For policy sits above conscience.

SEMPRONIUS' house

Enter SEMPRONIUS and a SERVANT of TIMON'S

  SEMPRONIUS.
 Must he needs trouble me in't? Hum! 'Bove all others?
    He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
    And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
    Whom he redeem'd from prison.

  SERVANT.
 My lord,
    They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
    They have all denied him.

    Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
    Thrice give him over.
 I see no sense for't,
    But his occasions might have woo'd me first;  
    For, in my conscience, I was the first man
    That e'er received gift from him.
 How fairly this lord strives to appear foul!
    Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot
    ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire.
         Exit




SCENE IV.

  LUCIUS' SERVANT.
 welcome, good brother, what do you think the hour?
  PHILOTUS.
 So much?
  PHILOTUS.
 I am of your fear for that.
 I'll show you how t' observe a strange event.

  HORTENSIUS.

  HORTENSIUS.

  LUCIUS' SERVANT.
 Five thousand mine.
 We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.

  FLAVIUS.
 What do ye ask of me, my friend?
  TITUS.

    Believe't, my lord and I have made an end:
    I have no more to reckon, he to spend.

  FLAVIUS.
 If 'twill not serve, 'tis not so base as you,
    For you serve knaves.
 No matter what; he's poor, and that's
    revenge enough.

  SERVILIUS.
 Good gods!  
  TITUS.

  FLAMINIUS.
 And mine, my lord.
 And ours, my lord.
 Alas, my lord-
  TIMON.

  TITUS.
  
  TIMON.
 Tell out my blood.
 Five thousand crowns, my lord.

  TIMON.
 Five thousand drops pays that.
 These debts may well be call'd desperate ones, for a
    madman owes 'em.
                                      Exeunt

                    Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS

  TIMON.

    Creditors? Devils!
  FLAVIUS.
 My dear lord-
  TIMON.
 My lord-
  TIMON.
 I'll have it so.

    Go, I charge thee, invite them all; let in the tide
    Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
 My lord, you have my voice to't: the fault's bloody.

  SECOND SENATOR.

    It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
    Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood
    Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
    To those that without heed do plunge into't.
  
    If wrongs be evils, and enforce us kill,
    What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
  ALCIBIADES.
 My lord-
  FIRST SENATOR.

  ALCIBIADES.
 What's that?
  ALCIBIADES.
 Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service,
    And slain in fight many of your enemies;
    How full of valour did he bear himself
    In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
  SECOND SENATOR.
 Friend or brother,
    He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
 How!
  ALCIBIADES.

  ALCIBIADES.
 Banish me!
    Banish your dotage! Banish usury
    That makes the Senate ugly.

A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house

Music.
 Tables set out; servants attending.

  SECOND LORD.
 Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red.
 Every man here's so.
 A thousand pieces!
  FIRST LORD.
 He sent to me, sir- here he comes.
 [Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such summer-birds
    are men- Gentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long
    stay; feast your ears with the music awhile, if they will fare so
    harshly o' th' trumpet's sound; we shall to't presently.

  FIRST LORD.
 My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that,
    when your lordship this other day sent to me, I was so
    unfortunate a beggar.
 Think not on't, sir.
 If you had sent but two hours before-
  TIMON.
 How do you? What's the news?
  THIRD LORD.
 I'll tell you more anon.

  THIRD LORD.
 It does; but time will- and so-
  THIRD LORD.
 Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip
    of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike.

    For your own gifts make yourselves prais'd; but reserve still to
    give, lest your deities be despised.
 I know not.

  FOURTH LORD.

  THIRD LORD.
 One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.

                                                          Exeunt

Without the walls of Athens

Enter TIMON

  TIMON.

    The gods confound- hear me, you good gods all-  
    The Athenians both within and out that wall!
    And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
    To the whole race of mankind, high and low!
    Amen.
 Hear you, Master Steward, where's our master?
    Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?
  FLAVIUS.
 As we do turn our backs
    From our companion, thrown into his grave,
    So his familiars to his buried fortunes
    Slink all away; leave their false vows with him,
    Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
    A dedicated beggar to the air,
    With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
    Walks, like contempt, alone.
 All broken implements of a ruin'd house.

  FLAVIUS.

                                [Embrace, and part several ways]  
    O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
    Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
    Since riches point to misery and contempt?
    Who would be so mock'd with glory, or to live
    But in a dream of friendship,
    To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,
    But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
    Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
    Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
    When man's worst sin is he does too much good!
    Who then dares to be half so kind again?
    For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.

    I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;  
    Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
 O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
    Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
    Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb-
    Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
    Scarce is dividant- touch them with several fortunes:
    The greater scorns the lesser.

    It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
    The want that makes him lean.
 Thou't go, strong thief,
    When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.

    For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
    That I might love thee something.
 I know thee well;
    But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
 Thy lips rot off!
  TIMON.
 Noble Timon,
    What friendship may I do thee?
  TIMON.

  ALCIBIADES.

  TIMANDRA.
 Art thou Timandra?
  TIMANDRA.

  TIMANDRA.

    I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
    The want whereof doth daily make revolt
    In my penurious band.
 Ay, Timon, and have cause.
  
  TIMON.
 The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
    And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
  ALCIBIADES.
 Why me, Timon?
  TIMON.
 Go on.
 Swear against abjects;
    Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,
    Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
    Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
    Shall pierce a jot.
 What then?
    Believe't that we'll do anything for gold.
 Consumptions sow
    In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
    And mar men's spurring.
 Down with the nose,
    Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away
    Of him that, his particular to foresee,
    Smells from the general weal.

  ALCIBIADES.

  TIMON.

  TIMON.
 That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,  
    Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,         [Digging]
    Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
    Teems and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
    Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
    Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
    The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
    With all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven
    Whereon Hyperion's quick'ning fire doth shine-
    Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
    From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
    Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
    Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
    Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
    Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
    Hath to the marbled mansion all above
    Never presented!- O, a root! Dear thanks!-
    Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas,
    Whereof ingrateful man, with liquorish draughts
    And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
    That from it all consideration slips-  

                        Enter APEMANTUS

    More man? Plague, plague!
  APEMANTUS.

    Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
    By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
    And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
    Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,  
    And call it excellent.

  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.
 I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.
 Thou'dst courtier be again
    Wert thou not beggar.

    The one is filling still, never complete;
    The other, at high wish.

  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.
 Ay, that I am not thee.

  APEMANTUS.

    That the whole life of Athens were in this!
    Thus would I eat it.
 First mend my company: take away thyself.
 What wouldst thou have to Athens?
  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.
 Under that's above me.

    Where feed'st thou a days, Apemantus?
  APEMANTUS.
 finds meat; or rather, where I eat it.
 To sauce thy dishes.
 When thou wast in thy gilt and thy
    perfume, they mock'd thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags  
    thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary.
 There's a
    medlar for thee; eat it.

  TIMON.

  APEMANTUS.
 Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves.

  TIMON.
 The commonwealth of Athens is
    become a forest of beasts.
 When I
    know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.

  TIMON.
 Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
  APEMANTUS.
 There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
 If I name thee.

  APEMANTUS.
 I would my tongue could rot them off!
  TIMON.
 Away,  
    Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
    A stone by thee.
 Rogue, rogue, rogue!
    I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
    But even the mere necessities upon't.

    Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
    Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
    Thy gravestone daily; make thine epitaph,
    That death in me at others' lives may laugh.

  APEMANTUS.
 Let us make the assay upon him; if he care not for't,
    he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how
    shall's get it?
  SECOND BANDIT.
 We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
    As beasts and birds and fishes.
 I'll example you with thievery:
    The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
    Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief,
    And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
    The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
    The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
    That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n  
    From gen'ral excrement- each thing's a thief.
 Cut throats;
    All that you meet are thieves.
 To Athens go,
    Break open shops; nothing can you steal
    But thieves do lose it.
 Steal not less for this
    I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!
    Amen.
              Exeunt THIEVES

                         Enter FLAVIUS, to TIMON
  
  FLAVIUS.
 Away! What art thou?
  FLAVIUS.
  
  TIMON.
 Then I know thee not.

    How fain would I have hated all mankind!
    And thou redeem'st thyself.
 Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
    Here, take.
 Be men like blasted woods,
    And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
    And so, farewell and thrive.
 O, let me stay
    And comfort you, my master.

 SCENE I.
 Before TIMON's cave

Enter POET and PAINTER

  PAINTER.
 As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he
    abides.
  
  POET.
 Good as the best.
 Performance is ever the duller
    for his act, and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
    the deed of saying is quite out of use.
 I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him.

  TIMON.
 [Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own
    work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have  
    gold for thee.
 Nay, let's seek him;
    Then do we sin against our own estate
    When we may profit meet and come too late.
 True;
    When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
    Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light.

    To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
    Be crown'd with plagues, that thee alone obey!
    Fit I meet them.
                   [Advancing from his cave]
  POET.
 Sir,  
    Having often of your open bounty tasted,
    Hearing you were retir'd, your friends fall'n off,
    Whose thankless natures- O abhorred spirits!-
    Not all the whips of heaven are large enough-
    What! to you,
    Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
    To their whole being! I am rapt, and cannot cover
    The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
    With any size of words.

    You that are honest, by being what you are,
    Make them best seen and known.
 We are hither come to offer you our service.
 Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
    Can you eat roots, and drink cold water- No?
  BOTH.
 What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

  PAINTER.
 Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
    Best in all Athens.

  TIMON.
 [To To POET] And for thy fiction,
    Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
    That thou art even natural in thine art.

    Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you; neither wish I
    You take much pains to mend.
 Most thankfully, my lord.
 Doubt it not, worthy lord.

  BOTH.
 I know not such, my lord.

    Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
    Confound them by some course, and come to me,
    I'll give you gold enough.

  BOTH.
 Name them, my lord; let's know them.

    [To the PAINTER] If, where thou art, two villians shall not be,  
    Come not near him.

    [To the PAINTER] You have work for me; there's payment; hence!
    [To the POET] You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
 Thou sun that comforts, burn.
 O, forget  
    What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
 They confess
    Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross;
    Which now the public body, which doth seldom
    Play the recanter, feeling in itself
    A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
    Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon,
    And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,
    Together with a recompense more fruitful
    Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
    Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
    As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
    And write in thee the figures of their love,
    Ever to read them thine.

  TIMON.
 Therefore, Timon-
  TIMON.
 Well, sir, I will.
 Therefore I will, sir, thus:
    If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
    Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
    That Timon cares not.

  FLAVIUS.
 Stay not, all's in vain.
 Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
    It will be seen to-morrow.
 Go, live still;
    Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
    And last so long enough!
  FIRST SENATOR.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
    That mine own use invites me to cut down,
    And shortly must I fell it.
 Tell my friends,
    Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
    From high to low throughout, that whoso please  
    To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
    Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
    And hang himself.
 His discontents are unremovably
    Coupled to nature.
 Thou hast painfully discover'd; are his files
    As full as thy report?
  MESSENGER.
 We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.
 This man was riding
    From Alcibiades to Timon's cave
    With letters of entreaty, which imported
    His fellowship i' th' cause against your city,
    In part for his sake mov'd.
 No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.

The TIMON's cave, and a rude tomb seen

Enter a SOLDIER in the woods, seeking TIMON

  SOLDIER.
                 Exit




SCENE IV.
 Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers before Athens

  ALCIBIADES.
 The SENATORS appear upon the walls

    Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
    With all licentious measure, making your wills
    The scope of justice; till now, myself, and such
    As slept within the shadow of your power,
    Have wander'd with our travers'd arms, and breath'd
    Our sufferance vainly.
 So did we woo
    Transformed Timon to our city's love
    By humble message and by promis'd means.

  FIRST SENATOR.
 Like a shepherd
    Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,
    But kill not all together.
 What thou wilt,
    Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
    Than hew to't with thy sword.
 Set but thy foot
    Against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope,  
    So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
    To say thou't enter friendly.

  ALCIBIADES.
 'Tis most nobly spoken.
'
    These well express in thee thy latter spirits.
 Dead
    Is noble Timon, of whose memory
    Hereafter more.

<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC.
 Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,
    Plead my successive title with your swords.
 Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
    A special party, have by common voice
    In election for the Roman empery
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
    For many good and great deserts to Rome.

    He by the Senate is accited home,
    From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,
    That with his sons, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yok'd a nation strong, train'd up in arms.

  SATURNINUS.
 How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.

                    [Flourish.
 They go up into the Senate House]

                      Enter a CAPTAIN  

  CAPTAIN.

    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors.
 I give him you- the noblest that survives,
    The eldest son of this distressed queen.
 Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
    Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
    A mother's tears in passion for her son;
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!
    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
    To beautify thy triumphs, and return
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;  
    But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.
 Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
 Let it be so, and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.

  MARCUS.
 Romans, do me right.
 People of Rome, and people's Tribunes here,  
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
  TRIBUNES.
 Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
    That you create our Emperor's eldest son,
    Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal.
 With voices and applause of every sort,
    Patricians and plebeians, we create
    Lord Saturninus Rome's great Emperor;
    And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
                           [A long flourish till they come down]
  SATURNINUS.
 Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
    To us in our election this day
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,  
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;
    And for an onset, Titus, to advance
    Thy name and honourable family,
    Lavinia will I make my emperess,
    Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
    And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.

    Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
  TITUS.

  SATURNINUS.
-
    Clear up, fair Queen, that cloudy countenance;
    Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
    Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-
    Princely shall be thy usage every way.

  SATURNINUS.

                                                      [Flourish]  
  BASSIANUS.
 Suum cuique is our Roman justice:
    This prince in justice seizeth but his own.

  TITUS.
 My lord, you pass not here.

  TITUS.

    Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
    Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
    That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.

  TITUS.
 And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
    That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs,
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
    If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
    Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride
    And will create thee Emperess of Rome.
  
    Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
    And here I swear by all the Roman gods-
    Sith priest and holy water are so near,
    And tapers burn so bright, and everything
    In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
    Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
    I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
 O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.

  TITUS.
 Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.

    Bury him where you can, he comes not here.

  MARCUS.
  
    My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;
    He must be buried with his bretheren.
 Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
    And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.

  MARCUS.

    Thou art a Roman- be not barbarous.
 Rise, Marcus, rise;
    The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw,
    To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome!
    Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
  [Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
    He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
 Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
 So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
    God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
  BASSIANUS.

  BASSIANUS.

    Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
    How I have lov'd and honoured Saturnine!
  TAMORA.

  SATURNINUS.

    Then at my suit look graciously on him;
    Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
 Rise, Titus, rise; my Empress hath prevail'd.

  TAMORA.

    And fear not, lords- and you, Lavinia.

  LUCIUS.
 We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
    That what we did was mildly as we might,
    Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.
 That on mine honour here do I protest.

  SATURNINUS.

    I will not be denied.

  SATURNINUS.

    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore  
    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
 To-morrow, and it please your Majesty
    To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
    With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bonjour.

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
    Lavina is thine elder brother's hope.
  [Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
 Then why should he despair that knows to court it
    With words, fair looks, and liberality?
    What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
    And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
  AARON.

  AARON.

    'Tis policy and stratagem must do
    That you affect; and so must you resolve
    That what you cannot as you would achieve,  
    You must perforce accomplish as you may.

    Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.

    This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.

  CHIRON.
                           Exeunt




SCENE II.

    Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
    And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
    That all the court may echo with the noise.

    I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.

  SATURNINUS.

  MARCUS.
 Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
    But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

    Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
    Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
 Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
  AARON.

  BASSIANUS.

    A barren detested vale you see it is:
    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
    Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;
    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.

    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
    That ever ear did hear to such effect;
    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
    This vengeance on me had they executed.

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.
 An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.

    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
    That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
 O Tamora! thou bearest a woman's face-
  TAMORA.
 I will not hear her speak; away with her!
  LAVINIA.
 Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
  
    Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
    [To CHIRON]  Do thou entreat her show a woman's pity.
 What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
  LAVINIA.

    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
    The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;
    O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
  TAMORA.
 Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
    Even for his sake am I pitiless.
 O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
    And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

  LAVINIA.
 So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee;
    No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
  
    This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.


                 DEMETRIUS throws the body
           of BASSIANUS into the pit; then exeunt
         DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA

  TAMORA.

    Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
    And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.
 O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
    That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
  AARON.
  [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
    That he thereby may have a likely guess
    How these were they that made away his brother.
         Exit
  MARTIUS.
 I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
    A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
    My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

  MARTIUS.
 Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,
    All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
    In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

  QUINTUS.
 The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
    Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
    To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

  TAMORA.

                                 [She giveth SATURNINE a letter]  
    SATURNINUS.

  AARON.
 My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

    Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison;
    There let them bide until we have devis'd
    Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
 High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
    I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
    That this fell fault of my accursed sons-
    Accursed if the fault be prov'd in them-
  SATURNINUS.

    Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
  TAMORA.

  TITUS.

  TITUS.
 Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
    An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
 Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
 If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.

    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face  
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.

    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.

ACT III.

                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write  
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.

    Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
    Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
    What fool hath added water to the sea,
    Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?
    My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
    And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
 O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
    That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
    Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,  
    Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
    Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
  LUCIUS.

    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
    Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.

    Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
    It would have madded me; what shall I do  
    Now I behold thy lively body so?
    Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
    Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee;
    Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
    Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.

    Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
    When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
    Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew
    Upon a gath'red lily almost withered.
 If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
    Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.

    Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
    Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.

  TITUS.
 Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
    Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
    For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
 Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
    Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
    Or any one of you, chop off your hand
    And send it to the King: he for the same
    Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
    And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
 Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
    That hath thrown down so many enemies,
    Shall not be sent.
 Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
    For fear they die before their pardon come.

  LUCIUS.
  
  MARCUS.

  MARCUS.
 What shall be is dispatch'd.

    Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand;
    Tell him it was a hand that warded him
    From thousand dangers; bid him bury it.

  TITUS.

    Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
    And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back-
    Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mock'd,
    That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
    More than remembrance of my father's death.

  TITUS.
 Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.

    Ah! now no more will I control thy griefs.

    Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
    He leaves his pledges dearer than his life.

Rome.
 TITUS' house

A banquet.

  MARCUS.
 Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
    Such violent hands upon her tender life.
 How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
    Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.

    What violent hands can she lay on her life?
    Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands?
    To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
    How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
    Lest we remember still that we have none.

  TITUS.

    There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.

    Ah, sirrah!  
    Yet, I think, we are not brought so low
    But that between us we can kill a fly
    That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
 Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
    He takes false shadows for true substances.

  BOY.

  MARCUS.

    See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.
 My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
    Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
    For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
    Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
    And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
    Ran mad for sorrow.
 Lucius, I will.

    Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
    What God will have discovered for revenge.
 'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.
 O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
    There is enough written upon this earth
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,
    And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.

    My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
    And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
    And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere  
    And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,
    Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape-
    That we will prosecute, by good advice,
    Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
    And see their blood or die with this reproach.
 The angry northern wind
    Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,
    And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
  BOY.

  BOY.

  TITUS.

    Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court;
    Ay, marry, will we, sir! and we'll be waited on.
  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.
 What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
'
  CHIRON.
 Ay, just- a verse in Horace.

    But let her rest in her unrest awhile-
    And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
    Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
    Captives, to be advanced to this height?  
    It did me good before the palace gate
    To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.

  DEMETRIUS.
 But me more good to see so great a lord
    Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
 Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.

  CHIRON.
 I mean she is brought a-bed.

  DEMETRIUS.
 Villain, what hast thou done?
  AARON.
 Thou hast undone our mother.

  AARON.
 It shall not die.

  AARON.
 Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
  
                     [Takes the CHILD from the NURSE, and draws]
    Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother!
    Now, by the burning tapers of the sky
    That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
    He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
    That touches this my first-born son and heir.
 I blush to think upon this ignomy.

  AARON.
'
    He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
    Of that self-blood that first gave life to you;
    And from your womb where you imprisoned were
    He is enfranchised and come to light.

    Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,  
    Although my seal be stamped in his face.
      [He kills her]  
    Weeke weeke!
    So cries a pig prepared to the spit.

  DEMETRIUS.
 O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
 You see I have given her physic,
                                         [Pointing to the NURSE]
    And you must needs bestow her funeral;  
    The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.

    The midwife and the nurse well made away,
    Then let the ladies tattle what they please.

                                             Exit with the CHILD




SCENE III.
 Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.

    Tell him it is for justice and for aid,  
    And that it comes from old Andronicus,
    Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.

  MARCUS.
 Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
    By day and night t' attend him carefully,
    And feed his humour kindly as we may
    Till time beget some careful remedy.
 Publius, how now? How now, my masters?  
    What, have you met with her?
  PUBLIUS.

    Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,
    No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;
    But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
    Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear;
    And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
    We will solicit heaven, and move the gods
    To send down justice for to wreak our wrongs.
 Marcus, loose when I bid.
 Now, masters, draw.

  TITUS.
 God forbid I
    should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days.
  
  MARCUS.
 Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
    oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the Emperor from you.
 Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver up a
    supplication?
  CLOWN.

    But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
    Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
    But he and his shall know that justice lives
    In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,
    He'll so awake as he in fury shall
    Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.

                                   [SATURNINUS reads the letter]
  SATURNINUS.

  CLOWN.
 Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.

  CLOWN.
  
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.

    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

    [To AEMILIUS]  Go thou before to be our ambassador;
    Say that the Emperor requests a parley
    Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
    Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
 Your bidding shall I do effectually.
            Exit
  TAMORA.

WITH PERMISSION.
 Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
    I have received letters from great Rome
    Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
    And how desirous of our sight they are.
 O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
    This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;
    And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.

    Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
    Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?
    A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
 Lucius, save the child,
    And bear it from me to the Emperess.
 Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.

  LUCIUS.

  LUCIUS.

  LUCIUS.

    I pried me through the crevice of a wall,
    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
    Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily
    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;
    And when I told the Empress of this sport,
    She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

  GOTH.

    Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think,
    Few come within the compass of my curse-
    Wherein I did not some notorious ill;
    As kill a man, or else devise his death;
    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
    Set deadly enmity between two friends;  
    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
    And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
 Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,
    The Roman Emperor greets you all by me;
    And, for he understands you are in arms,
    He craves a parley at your father's house,
    Willing you to demand your hostages,
    And they shall be immediately deliver'd.

  FIRST GOTH.
 What says our general?
  LUCIUS.

  TITUS.
 Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
    She is thy enemy and I thy friend.

    I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom
    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.

    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;  
    Confer with me of murder and of death;
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
    Where bloody murder or detested rape
    Can couch for fear but I will find them out;
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name-
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.

  TITUS.

  TITUS.

    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
    I will embrace thee in it by and by.

    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;  
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.

    Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.

  CHIRON.
 Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.

    Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
    To find another that is like to thee,
    Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.

    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
    They have been violent to me and mine.
  
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
    To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
    I will bring in the Empress and her sons,
    The Emperor himself, and all thy foes;
    And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.

  MARCUS.
 Now will I hence about thy business,
    And take my ministers along with me.
 Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,
    And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
 Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes  
    To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
 Tut, I have work enough for you to do.

    O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud;
    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.

    You kill'd her husband; and for that vile fault
    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
    Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
    Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.

                                         [He cuts their throats]
    So.

    FIRST GOTH.
 Flourish within
    The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.
 Although the cheer be poor,
    'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
 Because the girl should not survive her shame,
    And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
 Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
    Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
    Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
 Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
                                                [He stabs TITUS]
  LUCIUS.

    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of tears will drown my oratory
    And break my utt'rance, even in the time
    When it should move ye to attend me most,
    And force you to commiseration.

    But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
    Citing my worthless praise.

                  [Pointing to the CHILD in an attendant's arms]  
    Of this was Tamora delivered,
    The issue of an irreligious Moor,
    Chief architect and plotter of these woes.

    Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
    Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
 Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
    And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
    To be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death,
    As punishment for his most wicked life.
 Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.
 Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
    There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
 This is our doom.

  AARON.
 Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
    And give him burial in his father's grave.

    As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,  
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,
    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.

    Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
    And being dead, let birds on her take pity.
           Exeunt

>>



ACT I.
 Will this gear ne'er be mended?
  TROILUS.
 The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
    Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
    But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
    Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
    Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
    And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.

  TROILUS.
 Have I not tarried?
  PANDARUS.
 Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
 Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
    Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do.

    At Priam's royal table do I sit;
    And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts-
    So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.

  PANDARUS.
 But, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    I did.
 I tell thee I am mad
    In Cressid's love.
 O, that her hand,
    In whose comparison all whites are ink
    Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure
    The cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense
    Hard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell'st me,
    As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
    But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,  
    Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    The knife that made it.
 I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
    her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
    small thanks for my labour.

  TROILUS.
 For my part, I'll meddle nor make no  
    more i' th' matter.
 This woman's answer sorts,
    For womanish it is to be from thence.

    What news, Aeneas, from the field to-day?
  AENEAS.
 Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.
 Are you bound thither?
  AENEAS.
 Come, go we then together.
 SCENE 2.
 Who were those went by?
  ALEXANDER.

  ALEXANDER.
 This man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
    particular additions: he is as valiant as a lion, churlish as the
    bear, slow as the elephant-a man into whom nature hath so crowded
    humours that his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
    with discretion.

  CRESSIDA.

  ALEXANDER.
 That were we talking of, and of his anger.
 So he says here.
 And there's Troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell
    them that too.
 Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
 O Jupiter! there's no comparison.

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.

  CRESSIDA.
 He is elder.
 Pardon me, pardon me.

  CRESSIDA.
 No, but brown.

  CRESSIDA.
 Then Troilus should have too much.
 Nay, I am sure she does.

  PANDARUS.
 But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  CRESSIDA.

  CRESSIDA.

  PANDARUS.
 I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin.
 Without the rack.
 And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
 Did her eyes run o'er too?
  PANDARUS.

  CRESSIDA.
 They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
 What was his answer?
  PANDARUS.
 This is her question.
 'Two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white.
' But there was such laughing! and
    Helen so blush'd, and Paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so  
    laugh'd that it pass'd.
 So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
 So I do.

  CRESSIDA.


                       AENEAS passes

  CRESSIDA.
 He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person.
 When comes Troilus?
    I'll show you Troilus anon.
 If he see me, you shall see him nod
    at me.

  CRESSIDA.
 You shall see.

  CRESSIDA.
 Be those with swords?
  PANDARUS.
 Yonder
    comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
 Who's that?
  PANDARUS.
 That's Helenus.
 That's Helenus.
 Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!
  CRESSIDA.
 Peace, for shame, peace!
  PANDARUS.
 O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
    niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
    hack'd than Hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! O
    admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty.

  PANDARUS.

  CRESSIDA.

  PANDARUS.
 Good boy, tell him I come.
 Fare ye well, good niece.

  CRESSIDA.
 With due observance of thy godlike seat,
    Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
    Thy latest words.
 The sea being smooth,
    How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    Upon her patient breast, making their way  
    With those of nobler bulk!
    But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
    The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
    The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
    Bounding between the two moist elements
    Like Perseus' horse.
 Great Agamemnon,
    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
    Follows the choking.
 To end a tale of length,
    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
 At this fusty stuff
    The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
 And at this sport  
    Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
    In pleasure of my spleen.

  NESTOR.
 From Troy.
 Even this.
 How?
  AENEAS.

  AGAMEMNON.
 Ay, Greek, that is my name.

  AGAMEMNON.
 What's your affair, I pray you?
  AENEAS.
 He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.

  AENEAS.
 Trumpet, blow loud,
    Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
    And every Greek of mettle, let him know
    What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.

  AGAMEMNON.

    If none of them have soul in such a kind,
    We left them all at home.
  
    If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
    That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
 His youth in flood,
    I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.

  AENEAS.

    Achilles shall have word of this intent;
    So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.

  NESTOR.

  NESTOR.

  ULYSSES.
 And wake him to the answer, think you?
  NESTOR.
 Why, 'tis most meet.
 Do not consent
    That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
    For both our honour and our shame in this
    Are dogg'd with two strange followers.

  NESTOR.
 No, make a lott'ry;
    And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
    The sort to fight with Hector.
          Exeunt

ACT II.
 Thersites!
  THERSITES.
 Agamemnon-how if he had boils full, an over, generally?
  AJAX.
 Thersites!
  THERSITES.
 Did not the general run
    then? Were not that a botchy core?
  AJAX.
 Dog!
  THERSITES.
 The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted
    lord!
  AJAX.
 I will beat thee
    into handsomeness.
 Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.

  THERSITES.
 When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as
    slow as another.
 Thou shouldst strike him.
 Cobloaf!
  THERSITES.
 You whoreson cur!                               [Strikes him]  
  THERSITES.
 If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell
    what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou!
  AJAX.
 Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
 You see him there, do you?
  ACHILLES.
 Ay; what's the matter?
  THERSITES.

  THERSITES.
 Ay, but that fool knows not himself.

  THERSITES.

  ACHILLES.

  ACHILLES.
 I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the
    proclamation, and he rails upon me.
 I serve thee not.
 E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your
    sinews, or else there be liars.

  ACHILLES.
 To Achilles, to Ajax, to-
  AJAX.
 I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall
    I?
  ACHILLES.
 Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host,
    That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,  
    Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy,
    To-morrow morning, call some knight to arms
    That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
    Maintain I know not what; 'tis trash.
 Farewell.
 I know not; 'tis put to lott'ry.

  AJAX.
 O, meaning you! I will go learn more of it.
            Exeunt




ACT II.
 SCENE 2.

Troy.
' Hector, what say you to't?
  HECTOR.
 The wound of peace is surety,
    Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
    The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
    To th' bottom of the worst.
 I take to-day a wife, and my election
    Is led on in the conduct of my will;
    My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
    Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
    Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
    Although my will distaste what it elected,
    The wife I chose? There can be no evasion
    To blench from this and to stand firm by honour.
 What noise, what shriek is this?
  TROILUS.

  CASSANDRA.
 [Within] Cry, Troyans.


                  Enter CASSANDRA, raving

  CASSANDRA.
 Lend me ten thousand eyes,
    And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

    Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
    Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
                  Exit
  HECTOR.
 Paris, you speak
    Like one besotted on your sweet delights.

    You have the honey still, but these the gall;
    So to be valiant is no praise at all.
 Yet, ne'er the less,  
    My spritely brethren, I propend to you
    In resolution to keep Helen still;
    For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
    Upon our joint and several dignities.
 Why, there you touch'd the life of our design.
 I am yours,
    You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
                            Exeunt




ACT II.

The Grecian camp.
 Before the tent of ACHILLES

Enter THERSITES, solus

  THERSITES.
 How now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy
    fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I
    rail at him.
 Then there's Achilles, a rare engineer! If Troy be
    not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till
    they fall of themselves.
 O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
    forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose
    all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that
    little little less-than-little wit from them that they have!
    which short-arm'd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce,
    it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without
    drawing their massy irons and cutting the web.
 After this, the
    vengeance on the whole camp! or, rather, the Neapolitan
    bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the curse depending on those
    that war for a placket.
' What ho! my Lord Achilles!

                      Enter PATROCLUS

  PATROCLUS.
 If I could 'a rememb'red a gilt counterfeit, thou
    wouldst not have slipp'd out of my contemplation; but it is no
    matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly
    and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from
    a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
    direction till thy death.

  ACHILLES.
 Then tell me, Patroclus, what art
    thou?
  PATROCLUS.
 Agamemnon commands
    Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus' knower; and
    Patroclus is a fool.
 Derive this; come.
 Look you, who comes here?
  ACHILLES.
 Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
 Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart.
 But why, why? Let him show us a cause.

                                              [Takes AGAMEMNON aside]
  NESTOR.
 All the better; their fraction is more our wish than their
    faction.
 Hear you, Patroclus.
 Yet all his virtues,
    Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
    Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;
    Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
    Are like to rot untasted.
 Tell him so.
 I shall, and bring his answer presently.
 No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,
    no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.

  AGAMEMNON.

  AGAMEMNON.
 Let Ajax go to him.

    Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.
 [Aside] And how his silence drinks up this applause!
  AJAX.

  AGAMEMNON.
 Can he not be sociable?
  ULYSSES.
 [Aside] He will be the physician that should be the  
    patient.

  NESTOR.
 [To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.

  DIOMEDES.
 You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
 Wherefore should you so?
    He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
 What a vice were it in Ajax now-
  ULYSSES.
 Or covetous of praise.
 Or strange, or self-affected.

  DIOMEDES.

  ULYSSES.
 Let Achilles sleep.

    Exeunt

 Enter PANDARUS and a SERVANT

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.
 Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
 Faith, sir, superficially.
 Wholly, sir.
 To the hearers, sir.

  PANDARUS.
 I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I
    will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business
    seethes.
 Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
 You have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it
    whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your
    performance.
 Truly, lady, no.

  PARIS.
 We'll hear you sing,
    certainly-
  PANDARUS.
 Go to, sweet queen, go to-commends himself most
    affectionately to you-
  HELEN.

  PANDARUS.
 My Lord Pandarus!
  PANDARUS.

  PARIS.
 I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.

  PARIS.

  HELEN.

  PANDARUS.

  PANDARUS.
 Love! Ay, that it shall, i' faith.
 Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.

    These lovers cry, O ho, they die!
       Yet that which seems the wound to kill
    Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!
       So dying love lives still.
 He eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
    and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot
    deeds, and hot deeds is love.
 How chance my brother Troilus went not?
  HELEN.
 I long to hear how they spend
    to-day.
 Farewell, sweet queen.
 No, Pandarus.
 I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
 She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as
    if she were fray'd with a sprite.
-
    What, are you gone again? You must be watch'd ere you be made
    tame, must you? Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw
    backward, we'll put you i' th' fills.

    What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof the parties
    interchangeably.

      Exit
  CRESSIDA.
 More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.

  TROILUS.
 Nor nothing monstrous neither?
  TROILUS.
 This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that
    the will is infinite, and the execution confin'd; that the desire
    is boundless, and the act a slave to limit.
 They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
    able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing
    more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the
    tenth part of one.
 Are there such? Such are not we.
 We will not name desert before his birth; and, being
    born, his addition shall be humble.
 I thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you'll
    give him me.
 You know now your hostages: your uncle's word and my firm
    faith.

  CRESSIDA.

    Prince Troilus, I have lov'd you night and day
    For many weary months.
 Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
  CRESSIDA.

  CRESSIDA.
 My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
    'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.

  TROILUS.

  CRESSIDA.

    Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

  TROILUS.
 If ever you
    prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to
    bring you together, let all pitiful goers- between be call'd to
    the world's end after my name-call them all Pandars; let all
    constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all
    brokers between Pandars.
 Say 'Amen.
 Amen.
 Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS,
and CALCHAS

  CALCHAS.
 Let Diomedes bear him,
    And bring us Cressid hither.
 This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
    Which I am proud to bear.
 'Tis like he'll question me
    Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn'd on him?
    If so, I have derision med'cinable
    To use between your strangeness and his pride,
    Which his own will shall have desire to drink.
 Pride hath no other glass
    To show itself but pride; for supple knees
    Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
 I will lead the way.

  ACHILLES.

  AGAMEMNON.
 The better.

                                          Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
  ACHILLES.

  MENELAUS.

  ACHILLES.
 I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
    As misers do by beggars-neither gave to me
    Good word nor look.
 The welcome ever smiles,
    And farewell goes out sighing.

    All the commerce that you have had with Troy
    As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
    And better would it fit Achilles much
    To throw down Hector than Polyxena.
          Exit
  PATROCLUS.

    Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
    Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,  
    And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
    Be shook to airy air.
 Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
  PATROCLUS.

  ACHILLES.

    I'll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him
    T' invite the Troyan lords, after the combat,
    To see us here unarm'd.
 He knows not me.
 Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
    answering.
 Speaking is for beggars: he wears his tongue in's
    arms.

  PATROCLUS.
 I come from the worthy Achilles-
  THERSITES.
 And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.

  PATROCLUS.

  THERSITES.
 Your answer, sir.

  THERSITES.

  ACHILLES.
  
  THERSITES.
 Let me carry another to his horse; for that's the more
    capable creature.
 SCENE 1.
 A street

Enter, at one side, AENEAS, and servant with a torch; at another,
PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES the Grecian, and others, with torches

  PARIS.
 Is the Prince there in person?
    Had I so good occasion to lie long
    As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
    Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
 A valiant Greek, Aeneas -take his hand:
    Witness the process of your speech, wherein
    You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
    Did haunt you in the field.

    Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health!
    But when contention and occasion meet,
    By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
    With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
 Jove let Aeneas live,
    If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
    A thousand complete courses of the sun!
    But in mine emulous honour let him die
    With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
  AENEAS.

    Let's have your company; or, if you please,
    Haste there before us.
 That I assure you:
    Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
    Than Cressid borne from Troy.
 There is no help;
    The bitter disposition of the time
    Will have it so.

  AENEAS.

  DIOMEDES.
 Hear me, Paris:
    For every false drop in her bawdy veins
    A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
    Of her contaminated carrion weight
    A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
    She hath not given so many good words breath
    As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death.

Troy.
 Are you aweary of me?
  TROILUS.
 O Cressida! but that the busy day,
    Wak'd by the lark, hath rous'd the ribald crows,
    And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
    I would not from thee.
 Prithee tarry.

    You men will never tarry.

    O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
    And then you would have tarried.

    My lord, come you again into my chamber.

    You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.

  TROILUS.

                                          Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
  PANDARUS.
 Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
 Who!-nay, then.
 Come, come, you'll do him wrong ere you are
    ware; you'll be so true to him to be false to him.
 Do not you
    know of him, but yet go fetch him hither; go.
 Is it so concluded?
  AENEAS.
 Good, good, my lord, the secrets of neighbour Pandar
    Have not more gift in taciturnity.
 Is't possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take
    Antenor! The young prince will go mad.


                     Re-enter CRESSIDA

  CRESSIDA.

  CRESSIDA.
 I have forgot my father;
    I know no touch of consanguinity,
    No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
    As the sweet Troilus.
' I will not go from Troy.

    Exeunt




ACT IV.
 A street before PANDARUS' house

Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES

  PARIS.
 I know what 'tis to love,
    And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
    Please you walk in, my lords.
 Be moderate, be moderate.
 Why tell you me of moderation?
    The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
    And violenteth in a sense as strong
    As that which causeth it.
 Ah, sweet ducks!
  CRESSIDA.
 And is it true that I must go from Troy?
  TROILUS.

  CRESSIDA.
 What, and from Troilus too?
  TROILUS.
 From Troy and Troilus.
 And suddenly; where injury of chance  
    Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
    All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
    Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
    Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
    Even in the birth of our own labouring breath.

    As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
    With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
    He fumbles up into a loose adieu,
    And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
    Distasted with the salt of broken tears.

    Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.

    I speak not 'Be thou true' as fearing thee,
    For I will throw my glove to Death himself
    That there's no maculation in thy heart;
    But 'Be thou true' say I to fashion in
    My sequent protestation: be thou true,
    And I will see thee.
 Hear why I speak it, love.
 Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault!
    Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
    I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
    Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
    With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.

  DIOMEDES.
 Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously
    To shame the zeal of my petition to the
    In praising her.

    Let me be privileg'd by my place and message
    To be a speaker free: when I am hence
    I'll answer to my lust.

    Lady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,
    To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
 Hark! Hector's trumpet.
 How have we spent this morning!  
    The Prince must think me tardy and remiss,
    That swore to ride before him to the field.
 Come, come to field with him.

  AENEAS.

The Grecian camp.
 Lists set out

Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS, ULYSSES,
NESTOR, and others

  AGAMEMNON.
 Even she.

  NESTOR.

    Achilles bids you welcome.

  MENELAUS.
 Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
 I'll have my kiss, sir.

  CRESSIDA.
 In kissing, do you render or receive?
  PATROCLUS.
 I'll make my match to live,
    The kiss you take is better than you give;
    Therefore no kiss.
 No, I'll be sworn.
 Lady, a word.

    O these encounters so glib of tongue
    That give a coasting welcome ere it comes,
    And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
    To every ticklish reader! Set them down
    For sluttish spoils of opportunity,  
    And daughters of the game.
 If not Achilles, nothing.
 Here is Sir Diomed.

  AGAMEMNON.

    They call him Troilus, and on him erect
    A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
 Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
  TROILUS.
 Hector, thou sleep'st;
    Awake thee.

  AGAMEMNON.

    Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
    A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
    The obligation of our blood forbids
    A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
    Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so
    That thou could'st say 'This hand is Grecian all,  
    And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg
    All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
    Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
    Bounds in my father's'; by Jove multipotent,
    Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
    Wherein my sword had not impressure made
    Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay
    That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
    My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
    Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.

    Cousin, all honour to thee!
  AJAX.

    I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
    A great addition earned in thy death.
 There is expectance here from both the sides
    What further you will do.
 'Tis Agamemnon's wish; and great Achilles
    Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
 Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
    And signify this loving interview
    To the expecters of our Troyan part;
    Desire them home.


        AGAMEMNON and the rest of the Greeks come forward

  AJAX.
Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one
    That would be rid of such an enemy.
 I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.

  HECTOR.

  HECTOR.

  MENELAUS.
 O, pardon; I offend.

  NESTOR.
 'Tis the old Nestor.

  HECTOR.
 I would they could.
 I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.

  ULYSSES.

    There they stand yet; and modestly I think
    The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
    A drop of Grecian blood.
 The end crowns all;
    And that old common arbitrator, Time,
    Will one day end it.

  ACHILLES.

  HECTOR.

  HECTOR.
 Stand again.
 Henceforth guard thee well;
    For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;  
    But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
    I'll kill thee everywhere, yea, o'er and o'er.

    You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.
 I pray you let us see you in the field;
    We have had pelting wars since you refus'd
    The Grecians' cause.

  AGAMEMNON.
 First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;  
    There in the full convive we; afterwards,
    As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
    Concur together, severally entreat him.
 You shall command me, sir.
 Will you walk on, my lord?
    She was belov'd, she lov'd; she is, and doth;
    But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
 SCENE 1.
 Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol of
    idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
 Why, his masculine whore.

  THERSITES.

    Away, Patroclus!                              Exit with PATROCLUS
  THERSITES.
 Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow
    enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain
    as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his
    brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of
    cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his
    brother's leg-to what form but that he is, should wit larded with
    malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were  
    nothing: he is both ass and ox.
 Hey-day!
    sprites and fires!

         Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES,
            NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights

  AGAMEMNON.

  HECTOR.
  
  ACHILLES.
 Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, Princes all.
 Sweet draught! 'Sweet' quoth 'a?
    Sweet sink, sweet sewer!
  ACHILLES.

  AGAMEMNON.

                                             Exeunt all but THERSITES
  THERSITES.
 I'll after.

    Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!                Exit




ACT V.
 SCENE 2.

The Grecian camp.
 Before CALCHAS' tent

Enter DIOMEDES

  DIOMEDES.
 Calchas, I think.
 Stand where the torch may not discover us.

  DIOMEDES.

  THERSITES.

  THERSITES.
 Roguery!
  DIOMEDES.
 What did you swear you would bestow on me?
  CRESSIDA.

  DIOMEDES.
 And so, good night.

  TROILUS.
 In faith, I will, lo; never trust me else.
                                  Exit
  ULYSSES.
 Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
 O beauty! where is thy faith?
  ULYSSES.

  DIOMEDES.

  CRESSIDA.
 Ay, that.

  CRESSIDA.
 Nay, do not snatch it from me;
    He that takes that doth take my heart withal.

  DIOMEDES.
 Whose was it?
  CRESSIDA.
 Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not;
    I will not keep my word.

  DIOMEDES.

  THERSITES.
 What, shall I come? The hour-
  CRESSIDA.

  CRESSIDA.

  ULYSSES.
 Cressid was here but now.

  TROILUS.

  THERSITES.
 This she? No; this is Diomed's Cressida.
 O madness of discourse,
    That cause sets up with and against itself!
    Bifold authority! where reason can revolt
    Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
    Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
 Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
    In characters as red as Mars his heart
    Inflam'd with Venus.
 Not the dreadful spout
    Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
    Constring'd in mass by the almighty sun,
    Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
    In his descent than shall my prompted sword
    Falling on Diomed.

  TROILUS.
 O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
    Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
    And they'll seem glorious.


                       Enter AENEAS

  AENEAS.
  
    Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
    Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.

  TROILUS.
 Patroclus will give me
    anything for the intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not
    do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.

  ANDROMACHE.
 Here, sister, arm'd, and bloody in intent.

  CASSANDRA.

    Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate.

    Life every man holds dear; but the dear man
    Holds honour far more precious dear than life.
 Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you
    Which better fits a lion than a man.
 Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.

  TROILUS.
 Come, Hector, come, go back.

  PRIAM.
 I must not break my faith.

                                                      Exit ANDROMACHE
  TROILUS.
 Look how thy eye turns pale.
                  Exit
  HECTOR.
 Farewell.
 The gods with safety stand about thee!  
                           Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR.
 They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
    I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve.

  PANDARUS.
 A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles
    me, and the foolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing,
    what another, that I shall leave you one o' th's days; and I have
    a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones that
    unless a man were curs'd I cannot tell what to think on't.
 Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go look
    on.

  TROILUS.
 Yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
                                        Exit

                       Enter AGAMEMNON

  AGAMEMNON.
 Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles,
    And bid the snail-pac'd Ajax arm for shame.

  
                       Enter ULYSSES

  ULYSSES.
 O, courage, courage, courage, Princes! Great
    Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.
 Ay, there, there.
 So, so, we draw together.
 What wouldst thou?
  DIOMEDES.
 Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!

                      Enter TROILUS

  TROILUS.
 Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!

                     Enter ACHILLES

  ACHILLES.

  ACHILLES.
 Fare thee well.

    I would have been much more a fresher man,
    Had I expected thee.
 Shall it be?
    No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
    He shall not carry him; I'll be ta'en too,
    Or bring him off.
 Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark.
 The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it.
 Turn, slave, and fight.

      Exit
  MARGARELON.
 SCENE 8.
  
    On, Myrmidons, and cry you an amain
    'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.

  AGAMEMNON.

    Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, and DEIPHOBUS

  AENEAS.
 Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field.

    Never go home; here starve we out the night.

    Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed.
 Hector is gone.

    Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
    Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd
    Go in to Troy, and say there 'Hector's dead.

    Stay yet.

    That strain again! It had a dying fall;
    O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
    That breathes upon a bank of violets,
    Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more;
    'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.

  DUKE.
 O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
    To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
    How will she love when the rich golden shaft
    Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
    That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
    These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill'd,
    Her sweet perfections, with one self king!
    Away before me to sweet beds of flow'rs:
    Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs.
 This is Illyria, lady.

  VIOLA.
 And what should I do in Illyria?
    My brother he is in Elysium.

  VIOLA.

  CAPTAIN.

    Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
    Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
    The like of him.
 Know'st thou this country?
  CAPTAIN.
 Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
    Not three hours' travel from this very place.
 Orsino! I have heard my father name him.

  VIOLA.

    I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
    Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
    For such disguise as haply shall become
    The form of my intent.

    What else may hap to time I will commit;
    Only shape thou silence to my wit.
 What a plague means my niece to take the death of her
    brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
 By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights;
    your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.

  SIR TOBY.
 That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady
    talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in
    one night here to be her wooer.

  MARIA.
 He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a
    fool, he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a
    coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought
    among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
 Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
  SIR TOBY.
 Sweet Sir Andrew!
  AGUECHEEK.
 Bless you, fair shrew.
 And you too, sir.

  SIR TOBY.
 An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never
    draw sword again!
  AGUECHEEK.
 Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?  
  MARIA.
 Sir, I have not you by th' hand.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?
  MARIA.

  AGUECHEEK.
 What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed
    that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and
    bear-baiting.
 Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby.
 Your niece will
    not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me;
    the Count himself here hard by woos her.
 I am a fellow o' th' strangest
    mind i' th' world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes
    altogether.
  
  SIR TOBY.
 What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
  AGUECHEEK.
 Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these
    gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like
    Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a
    galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a
    jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.
 What
    dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by
    the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form'd under the
    star of a galliard.
 Shall we set about some revels?
  SIR TOBY.
 Taurus? That's sides and heart.

  VIOLA.
 You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call
    in question the continuance of his love.

  DUKE.
 Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,
    Rather than make unprofited return.
 Prosper well in this,
    And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
    To call his fortunes thine.





SCENE V.
 He shall see none to fear.

  MARIA.

  CLOWN.
 Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby
    would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh
    as any in Illyria.
                      Exit

                     Enter OLIVIA and MALVOLIO

  CLOWN.
' God bless
    thee, lady!
  OLIVIA.
  
  OLIVIA.
 Go to, y'are a dry fool; I'll no more of you.
 Besides, you
    grow dishonest.
 Anything
    that's mended is but patch'd; virtue that transgresses is but
    patch'd with sin, and sin that amends is but patch'd with virtue.
 The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I
    say again, take her away.
 Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, 'Cucullus non facit
    monachum'; that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my
    brain.
 I must catechize you for it, madonna.

  CLOWN.
 Look you now, he's out of
    his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,  
    he is gagg'd.

  CLOWN.
 Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well
    of fools!

                             Re-enter MARIA

  MARIA.

  OLIVIA.
  
    Fie on him! [Exit MARIA] Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from
    the Count, I am sick, or not at home- what you will to dismiss
    it.
 [Exit MALVOLIO] Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
    and people dislike it.
 A gentleman! What gentleman?
  SIR TOBY.
 Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this
    lethargy?
  SIR TOBY.

  OLIVIA.
 Well, it's all one.
 What's a drunken man like, fool?
  CLOWN.
 Like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above
    heat makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns
    him.
 Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz;
    for he's in the third degree of drink, he's drown'd; go look
    after him.
 What is to be said to him,
    lady? He's fortified against any denial.
 Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your door
    like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll
    speak with you.
 What kind o' man is he?
  MALVOLIO.
 Of what personage and years is he?
  MALVOLIO.

  OLIVIA.
 Let him approach.
 Your will?
  VIOLA.
 I can say little more than I have studied, and that
    question's out of my part.
 Good gentle one, give me modest
    assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in
    my speech.
 If I do not usurp myself, I am.
 Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for
    what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.
 Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
 It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in.

  VIOLA.
 I bring no overture of war, no  
    taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as
    full of peace as matter.
 Yet you began rudely.
 The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my
    entertainment.

  OLIVIA.
 Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.
 In Orsino's bosom.

  OLIVIA.
 Excellently done, if God did all.

    Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
    If you will lead these graces to the grave,
    And leave the world no copy.
 I see you what you are: you are too proud;
    But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
 With adorations, fertile tears,
    With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
  
  OLIVIA.

    He might have took his answer long ago.
 Why, what would you?
  VIOLA.
 Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
    And call upon my soul within the house;
    Write loyal cantons of contemned love
    And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
    Halloo your name to the reverberate hals,
    And make the babbling gossip of the air
    Cry out 'Olivia!' O, you should not rest
    Between the elements of air and earth  
    But you should pity me!
  OLIVIA.
 Get you to your lord.

    I cannot love him; let him send no more-
    Unless perchance you come to me again
    To tell me how he takes it.

    I thank you for your pains; spend this for me.

  VIOLA.

    What ho, Malvolio!

                        Re-enter MALVOLIO

  MALVOLIO.

    If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
    I'll give him reasons for't.

The sea-coast

Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN

  ANTONIO.

  ANTONIO.

  SEBASTIAN.
 But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of
    modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to
    keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
    myself.
 He left behind him
    myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had
    been pleas'd, would we had so ended! But you, sir, alter'd that;
    for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was  
    my sister drown'd.

  ANTONIO.
 She is drown'd already, sir, with salt water, though I seem
    to drown her remembrance again with more.

 Exit
  ANTONIO.
 And one thing more: that you be never so hardy to
    come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's
    taking of this.

 Exit
  VIOLA.

    How easy is it for the proper-false
    In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
    Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
    For such as we are made of, such we be.

    What will become of this? As I am man,
    My state is desperate for my master's love;
    As I am woman- now alas the day!-
    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!  
    O Time, thou must untangle this, not I;
    It is too hard a knot for me t' untie!                  Exit




SCENE III.
 Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
    eating and drinking.
 Th'art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
 Now let's have a catch.
 By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.
 I sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?
  CLOWN.
 There's a testril of me too; if one knight give a-
CLOWN.
 Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
  SIR TOBY.
 A love-song, a love-song.

           Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
           Journeys end in lovers meeting,
           Every wise man's son doth know.
 Excellent good, i' faith!
  SIR TOBY.
 A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
 To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
 My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a
    Peg-a-Ramsey, and                                    [Sings]
                  Three merry men be we.
 My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no
    wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this
    time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady's house, that
    ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or  
    remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
    time, in you?
  SIR TOBY.
 We did keep time, sir, in our catches.
 My lady bade me tell
    you that, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she's nothing
    allied to your disorders.
 [Sings] Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.

  MARIA.
 [Sings] But I will never die.
 [Sings] Sir Toby, there you lie.

  SIR TOBY.
 [Sings] What an if you do?
  SIR TOBY.
 [Sings] Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
  CLOWN.

    A stoup of wine, Maria!
  MALVOLIO.
 Go shake your ears.
 Do't, knight.

  SIR TOBY.
 Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.
 What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear
    knight?
  AGUECHEEK.
 I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good
    enough.
 The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a
    time-pleaser; an affection'd ass that cons state without book and
     utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so
    cramm'd, as he thinks, with excellencies that it is his grounds
    of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in
    him will my revenge find notable cause to work.

  SIR TOBY.
 I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;
    wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the
    manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and
    complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated.
 Excellent! I smell a device.

  MARIA.
 And your horse now would make him an ass.
 O, 'twill be admirable!
  MARIA.

  SIR TOBY.
 Give me some music.

    Come, but one verse.

  DUKE.
 He is about the house.
 If ever thou shalt love,
    In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
    For such as I am all true lovers are,  
    Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
    Save in the constant image of the creature
    That is belov'd.
 I think it well, my lord.
 And so they are; alas, that they are so!
    To die, even when they to perfection grow!

                  Re-enter CURIO and CLOWN

  DUKE.

          My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
                 O, prepare it!
          My part of death no one so true
                 Did share it.
 There's for thy pains.

  CLOWN.
 Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.
 Give me now leave to leave thee.
 But if she cannot love you, sir?
  DUKE.

  DUKE.
 But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
  VIOLA.
 Ay, that's the theme.
 Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

  FABIAN.

  SIR TOBY.
 Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally
    sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
  FABIAN.
 And we do not, it is pity of our lives.
 Close, in the name of jesting! [As the men hide she drops
    a letter] Lie thou there; for here comes the trout that must be
    caught with tickling.

 Shall this fellow live?
  FABIAN.

  MALVOLIO.
 Out, scab!

 What employment have we here?

 Some are born great, some  
    achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.
 She thus advises thee that

 I say, remember, Go to,
    thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so; if not, let me see thee
    a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch
    Fortune's fingers.
 I will be
    proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I
    will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very
    man.
 If thou
    entertain'st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles
    become thee well.
 I will smile; I will do everything that thou
    wilt have me.
 I could marry this wench for this device.

  AGUECHEEK.
 And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
 If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his
    first approach before my lady.
 SCENE I.
 No, sir, I live by the church.

  VIOLA.
 You have said, sir.
 Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with words may
    quickly make them wanton.

  CLOWN.
 Not so, sir; I do care for something; but in my conscience,
    sir, I do not care for you.
 Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
  CLOWN.

  VIOLA.
 I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
  
    Hold, there's expenses for thee.
- Is thy lady
    within?
  CLOWN.
 Yes, being kept together and put to use.

  CLOWN.
 My lady is within, sir.
 I will construe to
    them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of
    my welkin- I might say 'element' but the word is overworn.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.

  AGUECHEEK.
 I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

  VIOLA.
 I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
 My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant
    and vouchsafed car.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.

  OLIVIA.

  VIOLA.
 What might you think?
    Have you not set mine honour at the stake,  
    And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
    That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
    Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
    Hides my heart.

  VIOLA.
 I Pity YOU.

  OLIVIA.
 No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof
    That very oft we pity enemies.
 Would it be better, madam, than I am?
    I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

    And so adieu, good madam; never more
    Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?
  FABIAN.

  SIR TOBY.
 Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is
    no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention.

    Taunt him with the license of ink; if thou thou'st him some
    thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in  
    thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
    bed of Ware in England, set 'em down; go about it.
 Let there be
    gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no
    matter.

  AGUECHEEK.
 Where shall I find you?
  SIR TOBY.
 Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth
    to an answer.
 For Andrew, if he were open'd and you find so much
    blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the
    rest of th' anatomy.
 And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great
    presage of cruelty.
 Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.
 I have dogg'd him like his murderer.

SCENE III.

Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO

  SEBASTIAN.

  ANTONIO.
 My willing love,
    The rather by these arguments of fear,
    Set forth in your pursuit.
 Would you'd pardon me.

  SEBASTIAN.

  ANTONIO.
 Do not then walk too open.
 I will bespeak our diet,
    Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
    With viewing of the town; there shall you have me.
 Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
    You have desire to purchase; and your store,
    I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

  OLIVIA.
 Your ladyship were
    best to have some guard about you if he come; for sure the man is
    tainted in's wits.

  OLIVIA.
 Sweet lady, ho, ho.
 This does make some
    obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that?
    If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true
    sonnet is: 'Please one and please all.
'
  OLIVIA.

    It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.
 Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
  MALVOLIO.

  OLIVIA.
 God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand
    so oft?
  MARIA.

  OLIVIA.
 Ha?
  MALVOLIO.
 Heaven restore thee!
  MALVOLIO.
 'Go to, thou an made, if thou desir'st to be so';-
  OLIVIA.
 Am I made?
  MALVOLIO.
 Why, this is very midsummer madness.
 I'll come to him.

                                         Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
  MALVOLIO.
 I have lim'd her; but it is
    Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away
    now- 'Let this fellow be look'd to.

  FABIAN.
 How is't with you, man?
  MALVOLIO.
 Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live.
 My
    lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
 How now, mistress!
  MARIA.
 Do you not
    see you move him? Let me alone with him.
 The fiend is rough,
    and will not be roughly us'd.
 Why, how now, my bawcock!
    How dost thou, chuck?
  MALVOLIO.
 What, man, 'tis not for gravity
    to play at cherrypit with Satan.
 Hang him, foul collier!
  MARIA.
 No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.

 Exit
  SIR TOBY.
 Is't possible?
  FABIAN.
 If this were play'd upon a stage now, I could condemn it as
    an improbable fiction.
 His very genius hath taken the infection of the device,
    man.

  MARIA.

  SIR TOBY.

  AGUECHEEK.
 I warrant there's vinegar
    and pepper in't.
 [Reads] 'Thou com'st to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight
    she uses thee kindly; but thou liest in thy throat; that is not
    the matter I challenge thee for.
'
  FABIAN.

  SIR TOBY.
 You may have very fit occasion for't; he is now in some
    commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
 But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of
    mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the
    gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most
    hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.
 Fare thee well;
    A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
 Gentleman, God save thee.
 You'll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you
    hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your
    opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can
    furnish man withal.
 Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very
    competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire.
 This is as uncivil as strange.
 Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman
    till my return.
 Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
  FABIAN.
 I know the knight is incens'd against you, even to a mortal
    arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
 I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
  FABIAN.
 I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he
    gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is
    inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet
    hit the ground they step on.
 Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
 I'll make the motion.
 Give ground if you see him furious.
 Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will,
    for his honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the
    duello avoid it; but he has promis'd me, as he is a gentleman and  
    a soldier, he will not hurt you.
 If this young gentleman
    Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
    If you offend him, I for him defy you.

  SIR TOBY.
 One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
    Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
  
  AGUECHEEK.

  FIRST OFFICER.

    Take him away; he knows I know him well.
 I Must obey.

    I hate ingratitude more in a man
    Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,
    Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
    Inhabits our frail blood.
 O heavens themselves!
  SECOND OFFICER.
 Let me speak a little.

    In nature there's no blemish but the mind:
    None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind.
 Methinks his words do from such passion fly
    That he believes himself; so do not I.
  
  VIOLA.
 He nam'd Sebastian.
 O, if it prove,
    Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!        Exit
  SIR TOBY.
 I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

Before OLIVIA'S house

Enter SEBASTIAN and CLOWN

  CLOWN.
 Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not
    sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your
    name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither.

    Nothing that is so is so.

  CLOWN.
 Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and
    now applies it to a fool.
 I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me;
    There's money for thee; if you tarry longer
    I shall give worse payment.


             Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY, and FABIAN

  AGUECHEEK.

    Are all the people mad?
  SIR TOBY.

                                             [Holding SEBASTIAN]
  CLOWN.
 Nay, let him alone.
 What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this
    malapert blood from you.
 Hold, Toby; on thy life, I charge thee hold.
 Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't; and
    I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown.
 Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the
    lunatic.
 Well said, Master Parson.
 Good Sir Topas, do
    not think I am mad; they have laid me here in hideous darkness.

  CLOWN.
 I say to you this house is dark.
 I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though
    ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man
    thus abus'd.

  CLOWN.

  MALVOLIO.

  MALVOLIO.
 Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand,
    help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper; as I am a
    gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.

  CLOWN.
 Advise you what.
 Maintain no words with him, good fellow.
 God buy you, good Sir Topas.

    I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
 Good fool, some ink, paper, and
    light; and convey what I will set down to my lady.
 But tell me true, are you not mad
    indeed, or do you but counterfeit?
  MALVOLIO.
 Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

  CLOWN.
 Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.

    I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

    His counsel now might do me golden service;
    For though my soul disputes well with my sense
    That this may be some error, but no madness,
    Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
    So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
    That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
    And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me
    To any other trust but that I am mad,
    Or else the lady's mad; yet if 'twere so,
    She could not sway her house, command her followers,  
    Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
    With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,
    As I perceive she does.
 There's something in't
    That is deceivable.
 If you mean well,
    Now go with me and with this holy man
    Into the chantry by; there, before him
    And underneath that consecrated roof,
    Plight me the fun assurance of your faith,
    That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
    May live at peace.
 What do you say?
  SEBASTIAN.

 Do not desire to see this letter.
 Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
  CLOWN.
 I know thee well.

  CLOWN.
 There's gold.

  CLOWN.

  DUKE.
 Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let
    your flesh and blood obey it.
 Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer.

  VIOLA.

  DUKE.

  VIOLA.
 How can this be?
  DUKE.
  

              Enter OLIVIA and ATTENDANTS

  DUKE.
 What would my lord, but that he may not have,
    Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
    Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
 My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

  OLIVIA.
 Still so constant, lord.
 And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,  
    To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
 Ay me, detested! How am I beguil'd!
  VIOLA.
 Husband?
  OLIVIA.
 Her husband, sirrah?
  VIOLA.

  PRIEST.
 O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be,  
    When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
    Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
    That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
    Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
    Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
 We took him for a
    coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
 My gentleman, Cesario?
  AGUECHEEK.
 If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me; I think
    you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

  DUKE.
 Who hath made this havoc with them?
  AGUECHEEK.

  DUKE.
 Antonio, O my dear Antonio!  
    How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me
    Since I have lost thee!
  ANTONIO.
 I had a sister
    Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.

  SEBASTIAN.
 And so had mine.
 And died that day when Viola from her birth
    Had numb'red thirteen years.
 If nothing lets to make us happy both
    But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
    Do not embrace me till each circumstance
    Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
    That I am Viola; which to confirm,
    I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
    Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
    I was preserv'd to serve this noble Count.


        Re-enter CLOWN, with a letter, and FABIAN

    A most extracting frenzy of mine own
    From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
 Has here writ a letter to you; I
    should have given 't you to-day morning, but as a madman's
    epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are
    deliver'd.
 Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the
    madman.
 No, madam, I do but read madness.
 Prithee read i' thy right wits.

  CLOWN.

    My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
    To think me as well a sister as a wife,
    One day shall crown th' alliance on't, so please you,
    Here at my house, and at my proper cost.


                Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO

  DUKE.
 Madam, you have done me wrong,
    Notorious wrong.
 Well, grant it then,
    And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
    Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
    Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
    To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
    Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
    And, acting this in an obedient hope,
    Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
    Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
    And made the most notorious geck and gul
    That e'er invention play'd on? Tell me why.

    And now I do bethink me, it was she
    First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
    And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
    Upon thee in the letter.
 Maria writ
    The letter, at Sir Toby's great importance,
    In recompense whereof he hath married her.

    How with a sportful malice it was follow'd  
    May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
    If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
    That have on both sides pass'd.

             For the rain it raineth every day.

Verona.
 Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
    Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.

  PROTEUS.
 Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
 What?
  VALENTINE.

  PROTEUS.
  
    To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
    Of thy success in love, and what news else
    Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
    And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
 As much to you at home; and so farewell!
                                                  Exit VALENTINE
  PROTEUS.

  SPEED.

  SPEED.
 Therefore, thou art a
    sheep.
 Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
 But what said she?
  SPEED.

  PROTEUS.
 Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED.
 Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.

  PROTEUS.
 What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED.
' To testify  
    your bounty, I thank you, you have testern'd me; in requital
    whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself; and so, sir,
    I'll commend you to my master.

  JULIA.
 Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
    According to my shallow simple skill.

  JULIA.
 As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
    But, were I you, he never should be mine.
 Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA.
 Then thus: of many good I think him best.
 And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA.

  LUCETTA.
 Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.

  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 O, they love least that let men know their love.

  JULIA.
 Peruse this paper, madam.
 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA.

  JULIA.
 Say, say, who gave it thee?  
  LUCETTA.
 Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
 To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
 Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA.

    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
 What would your ladyship?
  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA.
 And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA.

  JULIA.
 As little by such toys as may be possible.

    Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love.
'
  LUCETTA.
  
    And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
 No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
 The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.

  LUCETTA.
 This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.

    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
 I see you have a month's mind to them.

  LUCETTA.

Verona.
 Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
    Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
  PANTHINO.
 Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
    Whereon this month I have been hammering.

    Then tell me whither were I best to send him.

  PANTHINO.

  ANTONIO.

  PANTHINO.

  PROTEUS.
 My will is something sorted with his wish.

    I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
    With Valentinus in the Emperor's court;
    What maintenance he from his friends receives,
    Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
 Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.

    No more of stay; to-morrow thou must go.

    Come on, Panthino; you shall be employ'd
    To hasten on his expedition.

    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

                       Re-enter PANTHINO

  PANTHINO.
 Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto;
    And yet a thousand times it answers 'No.

 How now, sirrah?
  SPEED.
 Well, you'll still be too forward.

  VALENTINE.
 Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.
 Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like  
    Sir Proteus, to wreath your arms like a malcontent; to relish a
    love-song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that
    had the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had lost his
    A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
    to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears
    robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas.

  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.

  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.
 Sir, I know that well enough.

  VALENTINE.
 That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.

  SPEED.
 That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
    count.
 Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
    of her beauty.
 I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
    I see her beautiful.
 If you love her, you cannot see her.
 True, sir; I was in love with my bed.

  VALENTINE.
 Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one  
    she loves.
 And have you?
  VALENTINE.
 Are they not lamely writ?
  VALENTINE.
 No, boy, but as well as I can do them.


                           Enter SILVIA

    Peace! here she comes.
 Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
  [Aside]  O, give ye good ev'n!
    Here's a million of manners.

  SILVIA.
 No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
    Please you command, a thousand times as much;
    And yet-
  SILVIA.

  SPEED.
  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.
 Madam, they are for you.

    And so good morrow, servant.
 What figure?  
  SPEED.
 Why, she hath not writ to me.
 What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
    Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  VALENTINE.

  SPEED.

  VALENTINE.
 That's the letter I writ to her friend.

  VALENTINE.
 I would it were no worse.

  VALENTINE.
 O, be not like your mistress! Be moved, be moved.

  JULIA.
 Why, then, we'll make exchange.
 And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
 He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog.
 Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it.
 This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father.

    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.

  LAUNCE.
 Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in losing
    the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy
    master, and, in losing thy master, lose thy service, and, in
    losing thy service- Why dost thou stop my mouth?
  LAUNCE.
 For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

  PANTHINO.
 Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
                                Exeunt




SCENE IV.
                       Exit
  SILVIA.
 Haply I do.
 So do counterfeits.
 And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE.
 I quote it in your jerkin.
 You have said, sir.
 Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
 I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.

  VALENTINE.
 'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.

  SILVIA.
 Who is that, servant?
  VALENTINE.


                             Enter DUKE

  SILVIA.
  
  DUKE.
 You know him well?
  VALENTINE.
 Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
    He is as worthy for an empress' love
    As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.

    Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me
    With commendation from great potentates,
    And here he means to spend his time awhile.

    I will send him hither to you presently.
 Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
              Exit THURIO

                         Enter PROTEUS  

  SILVIA.
 Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.

  SILVIA.
 My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
 Come, Sir Thurio,
    Go with me.
 Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
 And how do yours?
  PROTEUS.
 Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
    I have done penance for contemning Love,
    Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
    With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,  
    With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs;
    For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
    Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes
    And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.

  PROTEUS.
 Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS.

  VALENTINE.

  PROTEUS.

  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.
 Sweet, except not any;
    Except thou wilt except against my love.

  PROTEUS.
 Then let her alone.
 Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;  
    And I as rich in having such a jewel
    As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
    The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.

  VALENTINE.

    How shall I dote on her with more advice
    That thus without advice begin to love her!  
    'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
    And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
    But when I look on her perfections,
    There is no reason but I shall be blind.
 Marry, after they clos'd in earnest, they parted very
    fairly in jest.
 What, are they broken?
  LAUNCE.
  
  SPEED.
 What a block art thou that thou canst not! My staff
    understands me.

  SPEED.
 But tell me true, will't be a match?
  LAUNCE.
 If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will;
    if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.

  LAUNCE.
 To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
    To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
    To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
    And ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath
    Provokes me to this threefold perjury:
    Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.

    I will forget that Julia is alive,
    Rememb'ring that my love to her is dead;
    And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
    Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
 JULIA'S house

Enter JULIA and LUCETTA

  JULIA.
 Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  JULIA.
 A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
    To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
    Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
    And when the flight is made to one so dear,
    Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
  
    Didst thou but know the inly touch of love.
 The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.

    Then let me go, and hinder not my course.
 Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favour'd.

  LUCETTA.

  LUCETTA.
 That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
    A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
    And instances of infinite of love,
    Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
 Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him.

  JULIA.
 Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong
    To bear a hard opinion of his truth;
    Only deserve my love by loving him.
 SCENE I.
            Exit THURIO
    Now tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
  PROTEUS.
 My gracious lord, that which I would discover
    The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
    But, when I call to mind your gracious favours
    Done to me, undeserving as I am,
    My duty pricks me on to utter that
    Which else no worldly good should draw from me.

    This love of theirs myself have often seen,
    Haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep,
    And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
    Sir Valentine her company and my court;
    But, fearing lest my jealous aim might err
    And so, unworthily, disgrace the man,
    A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
    I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
    That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me.
         Exit

                        Enter VALENTINE

  DUKE.
 Be they of much import?
  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.
 What would your Grace have me to do in this?
  DUKE.
 There is a lady, in Verona here,
    Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,
    And nought esteems my aged eloquence.
 Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
    Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
    More than quick words do move a woman's mind.

  DUKE.
 But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

  VALENTINE.

    If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
    But rather to beget more love in you;
    If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,
    For why, the fools are mad if left alone.

    Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
    For 'Get you gone' she doth not mean 'Away!'
    Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
    Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.

  VALENTINE.
 Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
    That no man hath recourse to her by night.

  DUKE.
 But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
    How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
  VALENTINE.

  DUKE.
'
    'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
    Exit
  VALENTINE.
  
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.

    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

  LAUNCE.
 Valentine?
  VALENTINE.
 No.
 Who then? his spirit?
  VALENTINE.
 Who wouldst thou strike?
  LAUNCE.
  
  VALENTINE.
 No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.

  VALENTINE.

    What is your news?
  LAUNCE.
 Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.

  PROTEUS.
 No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
    Have some malignant power upon my life:
    If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,
    As ending anthem of my endless dolour.

    Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that,
    And manage it against despairing thoughts.
 She hath more qualities than a
    water-spaniel- which is much in a bare Christian.
' Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse
    cannot fetch, but only carry; therefore is she better than a
    jade.

  SPEED.
 How now, Signior Launce! What news with your mastership?
  LAUNCE.
 Well, your old vice still: mistake the word.
 The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
 Marry, the son of my grandfather.
 It was the son of thy grandmother.
 'Item: She brews good ale.
'
  LAUNCE.

  SPEED.
 'Item: She can sew.
 'Item: She can spin.

  SPEED.
 'Here follow her vices.
 'Item: She is not to be kiss'd fasting, in respect of her
    breath.
 'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.
 That makes amends for her sour breath.

  SPEED.
 'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.
 'Item: She is slow in words.
'
  LAUNCE.
 O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow
    in words is a woman's only virtue.

  SPEED.
 Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot be ta'en  
    from her.

  LAUNCE.

  LAUNCE.

  SPEED.
 More hair than wit.
 For me?
  LAUNCE.
 For thee! ay, who art thou? He hath stay'd for a better man
    than thee.

  SPEED.
 And must I go to him?
  LAUNCE.
 Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!

SCENE II.

  PROTEUS.

  DUKE.

    What might we do to make the girl forget
    The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
  PROTEUS.
 The best way is to slander Valentine
    With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent-
    Three things that women highly hold in hate.
  
  PROTEUS.
 Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
    Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
    By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
 And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
    Because we know, on Valentine's report,
    You are already Love's firm votary
    And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.

  PROTEUS.

    After your dire-lamenting elegies,
    Visit by night your lady's chamber window
    With some sweet consort; to their instruments
    Tune a deploring dump- the night's dead silence
    Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
 This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

 SCENE I.
 Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

  SPEED.
 That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
 Peace! we'll hear him.

  THIRD OUTLAW.

  VALENTINE.
 Whither travel you?
  VALENTINE.
 Whence came you?
  VALENTINE.
 From Milan.
 Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
    If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
 What, were you banish'd thence?
  VALENTINE.

  THIRD OUTLAW.

  SPEED.
 Peace, villain!
  SECOND OUTLAW.
 And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
    Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

    We'll do thee homage, and be rul'd by thee,
    Love thee as our commander and our king.

  THIRD OUTLAW.
 No, we detest such vile base practices.


                 Enter THURIO and MUSICIANS  

    But here comes Thurio.
 Ay, Silvia- for your sake.
 Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly; I pray you,
    why is it?
  JULIA.
 Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
 Is he among these?
  HOST.
 Ay; but peace! let's hear 'em.

  
         Then to Silvia let us sing
           That Silvia is excelling;
         She excels each mortal thing
           Upon the dull earth dwelling.
 How, out of tune on the strings?
  JULIA.
 You have a quick ear.

  JULIA.
 What's your will?
  PROTEUS.
 That I may compass yours.
 You have your wish; my will is even this,
    That presently you hie you home to bed.

    For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
    I am so far from granting thy request
    That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
    And by and by intend to chide myself
    Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

  JULIA.

  SILVIA.

  JULIA.

  PROTEUS.

  SILVIA.
 As wretches have o'ernight
    That wait for execution in the morn.
 Host, will you go?
  HOST.
 By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

  JULIA.
 Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
  HOST.
 Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
 Not so; but it hath been the longest night
    That e'er I watch'd, and the most heaviest.

Under SILVIA'S window

Enter EGLAMOUR

  EGLAMOUR.
 This is the hour that Madam Silvia
    Entreated me to call and know her mind;
    There's some great matter she'd employ me in.

  SILVIA.

  EGLAMOUR.

  EGLAMOUR.
 I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.
 If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't.
 You shall
    judge.
 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says  
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke.
 I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber.
 Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

               Enter PROTEUS, and JULIA in boy's clothes

  PROTEUS.
 Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
    And will employ thee in some service presently.
  [To LAUNCE]  How now, you whoreson
      peasant!
    Where have you been these two days loitering?
  LAUNCE.
 And what says she to my little jewel?
  LAUNCE.

  PROTEUS.
 No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
    again.

    Go presently, and take this ring with thee,
    Deliver it to Madam Silvia-
    She lov'd me well deliver'd it to me.

  JULIA.

  JULIA.
 Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA.


                     Enter SILVIA, attended

    Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you be my mean
    To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
 If you be she, I do entreat your patience
    To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
 Madam, please you peruse this letter.

    Pardon me, madam; I have unadvis'd
    Deliver'd you a paper that I should not.

  SILVIA.
 I pray thee let me look on that again.

  JULIA.

  SILVIA.
 There, hold!
    I will not look upon your master's lines.
 Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.

  SILVIA.

    Though his false finger have profan'd the ring,  
    Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

  JULIA.
 What say'st thou?
  JULIA.
 I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
 Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA.

    Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
    For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
    Which I so lively acted with my tears
    That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
    Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
    If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.
                        Exit SILVIA with ATTENDANTS
  JULIA.

    What should it be that he respects in her
    But I can make respective in myself,
    If this fond Love were not a blinded god?  
    Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
    For 'tis thy rival.

ACT V.

    She will not fail, for lovers break not hours
    Unless it be to come before their time,
    So much they spur their expedition.
 Lady, a happy evening!
  SILVIA.

  EGLAMOUR.
 Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
  PROTEUS.

  THURIO.
 I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
 She says it is a fair one.

  PROTEUS.

  THURIO.
 But well when I discourse of love and peace?  
  JULIA.

  THURIO.

  JULIA.
  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
 Neither.

  DUKE.
 And I will follow, more to cross that love
    Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.
 Come, come.

  SILVIA.

  FIRST OUTLAW.

Another part of the forest

Enter VALENTINE

  VALENTINE.

    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.

  VALENTINE.

  PROTEUS.
 What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
    Would I not undergo for one calm look?
    O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approv'd,
    When women cannot love where they're belov'd!
  SILVIA.

    Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!  
  PROTEUS.
 In love,
    Who respects friend?
  SILVIA.

  SILVIA.

  VALENTINE.
 Valentine!
  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.

    And, that my love may appear plain and free,
    All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
 O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
  PROTEUS.
 O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam  
    Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
 But how cam'st thou by this ring?
    At my depart I gave this unto Julia.

    It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
    Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
 Than men their minds! 'tis true.
 O heaven, were man
    But constant, he were perfect! That one error
    Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th' sins:
    Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.

    What is in Silvia's face but I may spy
    More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
  VALENTINE.

    Let me be blest to make this happy close;
    'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
 A prize, a prize, a prize!
  VALENTINE.

    I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

  VALENTINE.

    I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
    To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.
 Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
    Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.

  VALENTINE.
 And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
    With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.

    Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear
    The story of your loves discovered.
 The palace of LEONTES

Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS

  ARCHIDAMUS.
 I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to
    pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
 Beseech you-
  ARCHIDAMUS.
 Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we
    cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to
    say.
 Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

  CAMILLO.
 I very well agree with you in the hopes of him.

  ARCHIDAMUS.
 If the King had no son, they would desire to live on
    crutches till he had one.
 The palace of LEONTES

Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, CAMILLO, and ATTENDANTS

  POLIXENES.

  POLIXENES.
 We'll part the time between's then; and in that
    I'll no gainsaying.

  POLIXENES.

  LEONTES.
 I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
    You had drawn oaths from him not to stay.
 Tell him you are sure
    All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction
    The by-gone day proclaim'd.

  LEONTES.
- You'll stay?
  POLIXENES.
 Nay, but you will?
  POLIXENES.
 Your guest, then, madam:
    To be your prisoner should import offending;
    Which is for me less easy to commit
    Than you to punish.
 Had we pursu'd that life,
    And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
    With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
    Boldly 'Not guilty,' the imposition clear'd
    Hereditary ours.

  HERMIONE.
 By this we gather
    You have tripp'd since.
 Grace to boot!
    Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
    Your queen and I are devils.
 Yet, go on;
    Th' offences we have made you do we'll answer,
    If you first sinn'd with us, and that with us
    You did continue fault, and that you slipp'd not
    With any but with us.

  LEONTES.
 He'll stay, my lord.
 At my request he would not.
 But to th' goal:
    My last good deed was to entreat his stay;
    What was my first? It has an elder sister,
    Or I mistake you.
 'Tis Grace indeed.
  [Aside]  Too hot, too hot!
    To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
 But were they false
    As o'er-dy'd blacks, as wind, as waters- false
    As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
    No bourn 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true
    To say this boy were like me.
 Then 'tis very credent
    Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost-
    And that beyond commission; and I find it,
    And that to the infection of my brains
    And hard'ning of my brows.
 He something seems unsettled.
 How, my lord!
    What cheer? How is't with you, best brother?
  HERMIONE.
 You look
    As if you held a brow of much distraction.
 Mine honest friend,
    Will you take eggs for money?
  MAMILLIUS.

  LEONTES.

  HERMIONE.
 To your own bents dispose you; you'll be found,
    Be you beneath the sky.
 Be it concluded,
    No barricado for a belly.
 How now, boy!
  MAMILLIUS.
 I am like you, they say.
 Why, that's some comfort.
' 'Tis far gone
    When I shall gust it last.
 At the good Queen's entreaty.
 Business, my lord? I think most understand
    Bohemia stays here longer.
 Ay, but why?
  CAMILLO.
 Satisfy
    Th' entreaties of your mistress! Satisfy!
    Let that suffice.
 My gracious lord,
    I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful:
    In every one of these no man is free
    But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
    Among the infinite doings of the world,
    Sometime puts forth.
 These, my lord,
    Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
    Is never free of.
 Say it be, 'tis true.

  LEONTES.

    I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee;
    Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
    Or else a hovering temporizer that  
    Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
    Inclining to them both.
 Ay, and thou,
    His cupbearer- whom I from meaner form
    Have bench'd and rear'd to worship; who mayst see,
    Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
    How I am gall'd- mightst bespice a cup
    To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
    Which draught to me were cordial.

    I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
    Provided that, when he's remov'd, your Highness
    Will take again your queen as yours at first,
    Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
    The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms  
    Known and allied to yours.

  LEONTES.

  LEONTES.
 To do this deed,
    Promotion follows.
 Happy star reign now!
    Here comes Bohemia.
 Not speak?
    Good day, Camillo.

  POLIXENES.
 A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?
    I must be answer'd.
 By the King.
 I know not; but I am sure 'tis safer to
    Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.

    If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
    That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
    Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night.

    Your followers I will whisper to the business;
    And will, by twos and threes, at several posterns,
    Clear them o' th' city.
             Exeunt

 SCENE I.
 Why, my sweet lord?
  MAMILLIUS.
 You'll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if
    I were a baby still.

  MAMILLIUS.
 We shall
    Present our services to a fine new prince
    One of these days; and then you'd wanton with us,
    If we would have you.
 Merry or sad shall't be?
  HERMIONE.
 Let's have that, good sir.
 I have drunk, and seen the spider.
 You, my lords,
    Look on her, mark her well; be but about
    To say 'She is a goodly lady' and
    The justice of your hearts will thereto ad
    'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.
 Should a villain say so,
    The most replenish'd villain in the world,
    He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
    Do but mistake.
 You have mistook, my lady,
    Polixenes for Leontes.

  HERMIONE.

  LEONTES.
 Away with her to prison.
 My women, come; you have leave.

  LEONTES.
 Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.

  ANTIGONUS.
 For her, my lord,
    I dare my life lay down- and will do't, sir,
    Please you t' accept it- that the Queen is spotless
    I' th' eyes of heaven and to you- I mean
    In this which you accuse her.

  ANTIGONUS.

  FIRST LORD.
 By mine honour,
    I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see
    To bring false generations.
 If it be so,
    We need no grave to bury honesty;
    There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
    Of the whole dungy earth.

  LEONTES.
 What! Lack I credit?
  FIRST LORD.
 I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
    Upon this ground; and more it would content me
    To have her honour true than your suspicion,
    Be blam'd for't how you might.
 How could that be?
    Either thou art most ignorant by age,
    Or thou wert born a fool.
 Now, from the oracle
    They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,
    Shall stop or spur me.
  [Aside]  To laughter, as I take it,  
    If the good truth were known.

Sicilia.
 A prison

Enter PAULINA, a GENTLEMAN, and ATTENDANTS

  PAULINA.
 For a worthy lady,
    And one who much I honour.

  PAULINA.
 Here's ado, to lock up honesty and honour from  
    Th' access of gentle visitors! Is't lawful, pray you,
    To see her women- any of them? Emilia?
  GAOLER.

    Withdraw yourselves.
 As well as one so great and so forlorn
    May hold together.
 On her frights and griefs,
    Which never tender lady hath borne greater,  
    She is, something before her time, deliver'd.
 A daughter, and a goodly babe,
    Lusty, and like to live.
 The Queen receives
    Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
    I am as innocent as you.
'
  PAULINA.
 I dare be sworn.
 The office
    Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me;
    If I prove honey-mouth'd, let my tongue blister,
    And never to my red-look'd anger be
    The trumpet any more.
 Pray you, Emilia,
    Commend my best obedience to the Queen;
    If she dares trust me with her little babe,
    I'll show't the King, and undertake to be
    Her advocate to th' loud'st.
 Please your ladyship
    To visit the next room, I'll presently
    Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer
    Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
    But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
    Lest she should be denied.

  EMILIA.
 Madam, if't please the Queen to send the babe,
    I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
    Having no warrant.

  PAULINA.
 You need not fear it, sir.
 I do believe it.
 How does the boy?
  FIRST SERVANT.
 He took good rest to-night;
    'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
 To see his nobleness!
    Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
    He straight declin'd, droop'd, took it deeply,
    Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,  
    Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
    And downright languish'd.
 Leave me solely.


                 Enter PAULINA, with a CHILD

  FIRST LORD.
 You must not enter.
 Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.
 Not so hot, good sir;
    I come to bring him sleep.

  LEONTES.
 No noise, my lord; but needful conference
    About some gossips for your Highness.

  LEONTES.
 From all dishonesty he can: in this,
    Unless he take the course that you have done-
    Commit me for committing honour- trust it,
    He shall not rule me.
 Good Queen!
  PAULINA.
 On mine own accord I'll off;
    But first I'll do my errand.

    [To ANTIGONUS]  Thou dotard, thou art woman-tir'd, unroosted
    By thy Dame Partlet here.
 A nest of traitors!
  ANTIGONUS.

    And, might we lay th' old proverb to your charge,
    So like you 'tis the worse.
 Behold, my lords,
    Although the print be little, the whole matter
    And copy of the father- eye, nose, lip,
    The trick of's frown, his forehead; nay, the valley,
    The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek; his smiles;
    The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger.
 A most unworthy and unnatural lord
    Can do no more.
 I'll ha' thee burnt.
                          Exit
  LEONTES.

    Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
    And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
    With that thou else call'st thine.
 Go, take it to the fire;
    For thou set'st on thy wife.
 I did not, sir.
 Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.

    We have always truly serv'd you; and beseech
    So to esteem of us; and on our knees we beg,
    As recompense of our dear services
    Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
    Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
    Lead on to some foul issue.
 We all kneel.
 I am a feather for each wind that blows.

    You that have been so tenderly officious
    With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
    To save this bastard's life- for 'tis a bastard,
    So sure as this beard's grey- what will you adventure
    To save this brat's life?
  ANTIGONUS.

    Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
    To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,
    Casting their savageness aside, have done
    Like offices of pity.
 Prepare you, lords;
    Summon a session, that we may arraign
    Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath
    Been publicly accus'd, so shall she have
    A just and open trial.
 While she lives,
    My heart will be a burden to me.
 SCENE I.
 But of all, the burst
    And the ear-deaf'ning voice o' th' oracle,
    Kin to Jove's thunder, so surpris'd my sense
    That I was nothing.
 Great Apollo
    Turn all to th' best! These proclamations,
    So forcing faults upon Hermione,
    I little like.

  DION.
 Let us be clear'd
    Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
    Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
    Even to the guilt or the purgation.

    Produce the prisoner.

  OFFICER.

  OFFICER.
  [Reads]  'Hermione, Queen to the worthy Leontes, King of
    Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in  
    committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia; and
    conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
    lord the King, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being by
    circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the
    faith and allegiance of true subject, didst counsel and aid them,
    for their better safety, to fly away by night.
'
  HERMIONE.
 But thus- if pow'rs divine
    Behold our human actions, as they do,
    I doubt not then but innocence shall make
    False accusation blush, and tyranny
    Tremble at patience.
 Sir,
    You speak a language that I understand not.

  LEONTES.
 Now, my liege,
    Tell me what blessings I have here alive
    That I should fear to die.
 This your request
    Is altogether just.

  LEONTES.
 Break up the seals and read.
 Praised!
  LEONTES.
 This is mere falsehood.
 My lord the King, the King!
  LEONTES.

  LEONTES.
 Look down
    And see what death is doing.

    I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion.

    Beseech you tenderly apply to her
    Some remedies for life.
 He, most humane
    And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
    Unclasp'd my practice, quit his fortunes here,
    Which you knew great, and to the certain hazard
    Of all incertainties himself commended,
    No richer than his honour.
 Nor was't much
    Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,  
    To have him kill a king- poor trespasses,
    More monstrous standing by; whereof I reckon
    The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
    To be or none or little, though a devil
    Would have shed water out of fire ere done't;
    Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
    Of the young Prince, whose honourable thoughts-
    Thoughts high for one so tender- cleft the heart
    That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
    Blemish'd his gracious dam.
 I say she's dead; I'll swear't.
 A thousand knees
    Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
    Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
    In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
    To look that way thou wert.
 What's gone and what's past help
    Should be past grief.

Bohemia.
 Ay, my lord, and fear
    We have landed in ill time; the skies look grimly
    And threaten present blusters.

  ANTIGONUS.
 Make your best haste; and go not
    Too far i' th' land; 'tis like to be loud weather;
    Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
    Of prey that keep upon't.
 Go thou away;
    I'll follow instantly.

    I have heard, but not believ'd, the spirits o' th' dead
    May walk again.
 To me comes a creature,
    Sometimes her head on one side some another-
    I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
    So fill'd and so becoming; in pure white robes,
    Like very sanctity, she did approach
    My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me;
    And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
    Became two spouts; the fury spent, anon
    Did this break from her: 'Good Antigonus,
    Since fate, against thy better disposition,
    Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
    Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
    Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
    There weep, and leave it crying; and, for the babe
    Is counted lost for ever, Perdita  
    I prithee call't.
 For this ungentle business,
    Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
    Thy wife Paulina more.
 Poor wretch,
    That for thy mother's fault art thus expos'd
    To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,  
    But my heart bleeds; and most accurs'd am I
    To be by oath enjoin'd to this.
 I'll
    take it up for pity; yet I'll tarry till my son come; he halloo'd
    but even now.
 Would I had been by to have help'd the old man!
  CLOWN.

    This is some changeling.
 Open't.
 I'll go see if the
    bear be gone from the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten.

  SHEPHERD.
 Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' th' ground.

 SCENE I.


Enter TIME, the CHORUS

  TIME.
 What of her ensues
    I list not prophesy; but let Time's news
    Be known when 'tis brought forth.
 The report of her is extended more than can be
    thought to begin from such a cottage.

  POLIXENES.
 Thou shalt accompany us to the
    place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some
    question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
    uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.


    I have serv'd Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile;
    but now I am out of service.
  

      But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
        The pale moon shines by night;
      And when I wander here and there,
        I then do most go right.

  CLOWN.
 She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the
    shearers- three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they
    are most of them means and bases; but one Puritan amongst them,
    and he sings psalms to hornpipes.
  [Grovelling on the ground]  O that ever I was born!
  CLOWN.

  CLOWN.
 Indeed, he should be a footman, by the garments he has left
    with thee; if this be a horseman's coat, it hath seen very hot
    service.
 Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee.

  CLOWN.
 Softly, dear sir  [Picks his pocket];  good sir, softly.
  
  CLOWN.
 His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipt out of the
    court.

    Some call him Autolycus.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 The SHEPHERD'S cottage

Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA

  FLORIZEL.
 These your unusual weeds to each part of you
    Do give a life- no shepherdess, but Flora
    Peering in April's front.
 This your sheep-shearing
    Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
    And you the Queen on't.

  FLORIZEL.
 Even now I tremble
    To think your father, by some accident,
    Should pass this way, as you did.
 O, but, sir,
    Your resolution cannot hold when 'tis
    Oppos'd, as it must be, by th' pow'r of the King.
 Your guests are coming.
 Fie, daughter! When my old wife liv'd, upon
    This day she was both pantler, butler, cook;
    Both dame and servant; welcom'd all; serv'd all;
    Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here
    At upper end o' th' table, now i' th' middle;
    On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
    With labour, and the thing she took to quench it
    She would to each one sip.
 Come on,
    And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
    As your good flock shall prosper.
 Sir, the year growing ancient,
    Not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
    Of trembling winter, the fairest flow'rs o' th' season  
    Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
    Which some call nature's bastards.

  POLIXENES.

  CAMILLO.
 Sure, this robe of mine  
    Does change my disposition.
 I'll swear for 'em.

  POLIXENES.
 This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
    Ran on the green-sward; nothing she does or seems
    But smacks of something greater than herself,
    Too noble for this place.
 He says he loves my daughter;
    I think so too; for never gaz'd the moon
    Upon the water as he'll stand and read,
    As 'twere my daughter's eyes; and, to be plain,
    I think there is not half a kiss to choose
    Who loves another best.

  POLIXENES.

  CLOWN.

  SERVANT.

  CLOWN.
 Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow.
 Why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
    would think a smock were she-angel, he so chants to the
    sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
 Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.


                   Enter AUTOLYCUS, Singing

           Lawn as white as driven snow;
           Cypress black as e'er was crow;
           Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
           Masks for faces and for noses;
           Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
           Perfume for a lady's chamber;  
           Golden quoifs and stomachers,
           For my lads to give their dears;
           Pins and poking-sticks of steel-
           What maids lack from head to heel.
 Clammer your tongues, and
    not a word more.
 And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it
    behoves men to be wary.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 Pray now, buy some.
 Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress Taleporter,
    and five or six honest wives that were present.
 Pray you now, buy it.
 Here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the
    coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom
    above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of
    maids.

  DORCAS.

  MOPSA.
 If thou'lt bear a part, thou shalt hear;
    'tis in three parts.

  DORCAS.

  AUTOLYCUS.

  DORCAS.

  DORCAS.

  DORCAS.

  AUTOLYCUS.
    Thou hast sworn my love to be.

  MOPSA.
 You weary those that refresh us.
 Leave your prating; since these good men are pleas'd, let
    them come in; but quickly now.

    [To CAMILLO]  Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
 Sooth, when I was young
    And handed love as you do, I was wont
    To load my she with knacks; I would have ransack'd
    The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
    To her acceptance: you have let him go
    And nothing marted with him.
 If your lass
    Interpretation should abuse and call this
    Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited  
    For a reply, at least if you make a care
    Of happy holding her.

  POLIXENES.
 Fairly offer'd.

  CAMILLO.
 This shows a sound affection.

  SHEPHERD.
 One being dead,
    I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
    Enough then for your wonder.
 He neither does nor shall.

  POLIXENES.
 By my white beard,
    You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
    Something unfilial.

  FLORIZEL.

    Mark our contract.
 For thee, fond boy,
    If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
    That thou no more shalt see this knack- as never
    I mean thou shalt- we'll bar thee from succession;
    Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
    Farre than Deucalion off.
  [To FLORIZEL]  O sir,
    You have undone a man of fourscore-three
    That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
    To die upon the bed my father died,
    To lie close by his honest bones; but now
    Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
    Where no priest shovels in dust.
 [To PERDITA] O cursed wretch,
    That knew'st this was the Prince, and wouldst adventure
    To mingle faith with him!- Undone, undone!
    If I might die within this hour, I have liv'd
    To die when I desire.
                                   Exit
  FLORIZEL.
 At this time  
    He will allow no speech- which I do guess
    You do not purpose to him- and as hardly
    Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear;
    Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,
    Come not before him.

    I think Camillo?
  CAMILLO.
 It cannot fail but by
    The violation of my faith; and then
    Let nature crush the sides o' th' earth together
    And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.

  CAMILLO.
 Be advis'd.
 Camillo,
    Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
    Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
    The close earth wombs, or the profound seas hides
    In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
    To this my fair belov'd.
 Let myself and Fortune
    Tug for the time to come.

    And most opportune to her need I have
    A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
    For this design.

    Or stronger for your need.
 It is my father's music
    To speak your deeds; not little of his care
    To have them recompens'd as thought on.

  CAMILLO.
 Well, my lord,
    If you may please to think I love the King,
    And through him what's nearest to him, which is
    Your gracious self, embrace but my direction.

  FLORIZEL.
  
  PERDITA.
 My lord,
    Fear none of this.
 They throng who should
    buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a
    benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was
    best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I rememb'red.
 No hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, and admiring
    the nothing of it.


              CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward  

  CAMILLO.
 Happy be you!
    All that you speak shows fair.
  [seeing AUTOLYCUS]  Who have we here?
    We'll make an instrument of this; omit
    Nothing may give us aid.
 How now, good fellow! Why shak'st thou so?
    Fear not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
  [Giving money]  
  AUTOLYCUS.
 I am a poor fellow, sir.
 Unbuckle, unbuckle.

  CAMILLO.
 Nay, you shall have no hat.
 O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
    Pray you a word.

  FLORIZEL.
 The swifter speed the better.
 The Prince himself is
    about a piece of iniquity- stealing away from his father with his
    clog at his heels.

  CLOWN.

  CLOWN.

  SHEPHERD.

  CLOWN.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 There is that in this fardel
    will make him scratch his beard.
  [Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
    sometimes by chance.

  CLOWN.
 We are but plain fellows, sir.
 What advocate hast thou to him?
  SHEPHERD.
 Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant; say you have none.

  SHEPHERD.

  AUTOLYCUS.

  SHEPHERD.
 The King is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new
    ship to purge melancholy and air himself; for, if thou be'st
    capable of things serious, thou must know the King is full of
    grief.

  SHEPHERD.
 So 'tis said, sir- about his son, that should have
    married a shepherd's daughter.
 If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly; the
    curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the
    back of man, the heart of monster.
 An old
    sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his
    daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be ston'd; but that
    death is too soft for him, say I.
 Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear, an't like you,
    sir?
  AUTOLYCUS.
 Show the inside of your purse to the
    outside of his hand, and no more ado.
 Let's before, as he bids us.
 I am courted now with a
    double occasion- gold, and a means to do the Prince my master
    good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I
    will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him.

 SCENE I.
 Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
    A saint-like sorrow.
 No fault could you make
    Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
    More penitence than done trespass.
 At the last,
    Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;
    With them forgive yourself.

  PAULINA.

  LEONTES.
 Now, good now,
    Say so but seldom.

    You might have spoken a thousand things that would
    Have done the time more benefit, and grac'd
    Your kindness better.

  PAULINA.
 Besides, the gods
    Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
    For has not the divine Apollo said,
    Is't not the tenour of his oracle,
    That King Leontes shall not have an heir
    Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall,
    Is all as monstrous to our human reason
    As my Antigonus to break his grave
    And come again to me; who, on my life,
    Did perish with the infant.
 Great Alexander
    Left his to th' worthiest; so his successor
    Was like to be the best.
 Good Paulina,  
    Who hast the memory of Hermione,
    I know, in honour, O that ever I
    Had squar'd me to thy counsel! Then, even now,
    I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
    Have taken treasure from her lips-
  PAULINA.
 And left them
    More rich for what they yielded.
 One worse,
    And better us'd, would make her sainted spirit
    Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
    Where we offend her now, appear soul-vex'd,
    And begin 'Why to me'-
  PAULINA.

  PAULINA.
 I have done.
 She shall not be so young
    As was your former; but she shall be such  
    As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy
    To see her in your arms.

  GENTLEMAN.

    The one I have almost forgot- your pardon;
    The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
    Will have your tongue too.
 How! not women?
  GENTLEMAN.
 Go, Cleomenes;
    Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
    Bring them to our embracement.
 Prithee no more; cease.
 Sure,
    When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
    Will bring me to consider that which may
    Unfurnish me of reason.

  FLORIZEL.
 Good, my lord,
    She came from Libya.
  
  LEONTES.
 Most royal sir, from thence; from him whose daughter
    His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her; thence,
    A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
    To execute the charge my father gave me
    For visiting your Highness.
 Most noble sir,
    That which I shall report will bear no credit,
    Were not the proof so nigh.
 Camillo has betray'd me;
    Whose honour and whose honesty till now
    Endur'd all weathers.
 We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;  
    The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.
 My lord,
    Is this the daughter of a king?
  FLORIZEL.
 With thought of such affections,
    Step forth mine advocate; at your request
    My father will grant precious things as trifles.

  PAULINA.
 Upon which errand
    I now go toward him; therefore, follow me,
    And mark what way I make.
 Before the palace of LEONTES

Enter AUTOLYCUS and a GENTLEMAN

  AUTOLYCUS.

  FIRST GENTLEMAN.
 I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
    changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of
    admiration.
 The oracle is fulfill'd:
    the King's daughter is found.
 Has the
    King found his heir?
  THIRD GENTLEMAN.
 There was casting up
    of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such
    distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour.
 Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a
    weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns.
 She
    lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing
    as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be
    in danger of losing.
 Who would be thence that has the benefit of
    access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born.

                                                Exeunt GENTLEMEN
  AUTOLYCUS.
 Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would
    preferment drop on my head.


                    Enter SHEPHERD and CLOWN

    Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already
    appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
 You denied to fight with me this
    other day, because I was no gentleman born.

  AUTOLYCUS.
 And so have I, boy.

    And so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that
    ever we shed.
 Give me thy hand.
 How if it be false, son?
  CLOWN.
 If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in
    the behalf of his friend.
 Ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow.
 What, sovereign sir,
    I did not well, I meant well.
 O Paulina,
    We honour you with trouble; but we came
    To see the statue of our queen.
 First, you, my liege.
 Lady,
    Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
    Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

  LEONTES.
 The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
    As we are mock'd with art.

  PAULINA.

  LEONTES.
 Let 't alone.
 Good my lord, forbear.

  PERDITA.

  LEONTES.
 Come;
    I'll fill your grave up.

  CAMILLO.
 Kneel,
    And pray your mother's blessing.
 O peace, Paulina!
    Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
    As I by thine a wife.
                Exeunt

A LOVER'S COMPLAINT

by William Shakespeare



  From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
  A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
  My spirits t'attend this double voice accorded,
  And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Tearing of papers, breaking rings atwain,
  Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.


  Sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride,
  As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend;
  Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
  To th' orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
  Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
  To every place at once, and nowhere fixed,
  The mind and sight distractedly commixed.


  These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,
  And often kissed, and often 'gan to tear;
  Cried, 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
  What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
  Ink would have seemed more black and damned here!  
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  Big discontents so breaking their contents.

  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.


  'Well could he ride, and often men would say,  
  "That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
  Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
  What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!"
  And controversy hence a question takes
  Whether the horse by him became his deed,
  Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed.


  'But ah, who ever shunned by precedent
  The destined ill she must herself assay?
  Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
  To put the by-past perils in her way?
  Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;  
  For when we rage, advice is often seen
  By blunting us to make our wills more keen.

  O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!
  The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
  Though Reason weep, and cry it is thy last.

  They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
  And so much less of shame in me remains
  By how much of me their reproach contains.

  Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harmed;  
  Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
  And reigned commanding in his monarchy.


  '"And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,
  With twisted metal amorously empleached,
  I have receiv'd from many a several fair,
  Their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched,
  With the annexions of fair gems enriched,
  And deep-brained sonnets that did amplify
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.


  '"Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
  Or sister sanctified, of holiest note,
  Which late her noble suit in court did shun,
  Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
  For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
  But kept cold distance, and did thence remove
  To spend her living in eternal love.


  '"But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave
  The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives,
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves!
  She that her fame so to herself contrives,
  The scars of battle scapeth by the flight,
  And makes her absence valiant, not her might.

  I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
  Must for your victory us all congest,
  As compound love to physic your cold breast.


  '"Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
  Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,
  And supplicant their sighs to your extend,
  To leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine,
  Lending soft audience to my sweet design,
  And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,
  That shall prefer and undertake my troth.
"

  'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,  
  Whose sights till then were levelled on my face;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  With brinish current downward flowed apace.


  'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
  In the small orb of one particular tear!
  But with the inundation of the eyes
  What rocky heart to water will not wear?
  What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.

  Who, young and simple, would not be so lovered?
  Ay me, I fell, and yet do question make
  What I should do again for such a sake.
