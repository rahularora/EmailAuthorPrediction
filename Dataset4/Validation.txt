"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
Buonapartes.
"

"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the
least disconcerted by this reception.


"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like
these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna.
 "My daughter is coming for
me to take me there.
"

"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been
put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit
said things he did not even wish to be believed.
 What answer did
Novosiltsev get? None.


"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been sent
instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of
Prussia's consent by assault.
 Had you heard?"

"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince.
 "But tell me," he
added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be
appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor
creature.


"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,"
was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
 "Lavater would have said I lack the
bump of paternity.
 He frowned.
 Anna Pavlovna meditated.


"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she
asked.
.
 She has a
brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.
 He is an
aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here tonight.
"

"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovna's
hand and for some reason drawing it downwards.


"Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise, young
Bolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be
arranged.
 She had been
married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to
any large gatherings, but only to small receptions.
 The Abbe Morio
and many others had also come.


Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval.
 Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and
carrying her burden so lightly.
 This stout
young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known
grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow.


"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
as she conducted him to her.
 Anna
Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know the Abbe
Morio? He is a most interesting man.


"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.


Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovna's
was the first he had attended in Russia.
 He knew that all the
intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child
in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any
clever conversation that was to be heard.
 Here the
conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity
to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.
 As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially
choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the
kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to her
guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice
morsels.
 The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the Duc d'Enghien.


"The vicomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of
the guests.


The princess smiled.
 She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly beautiful
woman.


The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary.
 All the time the story was
being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more
beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace.
 "Fetch me my workbag.
"

There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat.


Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance
to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of
this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly.


"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak.


"Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging his
shoulders.
.
.
 the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the
people," the abbe was saying.
 "It is only necessary for one powerful
nation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place herself
disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the
maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
world!"

"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning.


"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had
the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of
the climate," said he.
 Everything about
him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife.
 And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed
to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.
"

"And Lise, your wife?"

"She will go to the country.
.


"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre.
 "I will come to supper with
you.
 May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte
who was continuing his story.


"No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question.


"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman,
holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising.


"Very lovely," said Prince Andrew.


"How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him into the
anteroom.
 "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg.
"

The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the
best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections.
 She had now come to
Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.


"Listen to me, Prince," said she.


Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last.
 Prince Vasili knew this, and having once realized that
if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable
to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence.
 She had reminded him of what was quite true;
he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.

Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those
women--mostly mothers--who, having once made up their minds, will not
rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary
to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make
scenes.
.
" she
faltered.
 "You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov.
.
.
"

"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?"

"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"

"Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don't promise.
 What have they done for Louis XVII,
for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he became more
animated.
 The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors
to compliment the usurper.

By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society--I mean
good French society--will have been forever destroyed, and then.
.
.
.


But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
"

"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit
murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him
a great man," remarked the vicomte.


"He could not do that.
.
 Well, after that.


"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.
"

Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess.
 But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had
not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator.


"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the fact
of a great man executing a duc--or even an ordinary man who--is innocent
and untried?"

"I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the
18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at
all like the conduct of a great man!"

"And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the
little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
 When he smiled,
his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
another--a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
ask forgiveness.
 So it
seems to me.
.
 but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify.
"

Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go.
" And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.


"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy.
"

Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty.
.
.






CHAPTER VI


Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
to take their leave.
 Besides this he was
absent-minded.
" And
everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.


Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
come into the hall.
 They listened to
the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so.


"Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable
tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
 Hippolyte
burst out laughing.
 "I pity the poor husband, that little officer who
gives himself the airs of a monarch.


"That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light.
"

It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract
conversation.


"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher.
 It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.

Pierre rubbed his forehead.


Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
.
 I must.
.
" He paused.
 Evidently Pierre's words touched her to the quick.

Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it.
 What do you think?"

Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply.

and then you know, Andre.


"There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of
his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in
the country.


"I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince Andrew
slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
"

"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew.
 He seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
.
.
 No, excuse me!
An outsider is out of place here.
.


"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which
indicates that patience is exhausted.
 Her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the timid,
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail.


"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as
he would have done to a stranger.






CHAPTER VIII


The friends were silent.


"Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.
 It will all be wasted on trifles.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise.
 If you marry
expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot!.
" and he waved his arm.
.
 If you only knew
what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right.


"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should consider
yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life.
 And you.


"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre.
 He considered his friend
a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest
degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best
described as strength of will.


Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise
and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels
that they may run smoothly.


"My part is played out," said Prince Andrew.


"But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face relaxing into
a careless, merry smile.
 Only I haven't the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to
consult you seriously.
 You'll be all right anywhere.
 It suits you so badly--all
this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"

"What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging his
shoulders.
.
 Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go.


Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
 A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses.
 From the third room came sounds of
laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
general commotion.
 Three others were romping with a young bear, one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
 Here is Petya!
Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.


"First of all you must drink!"

Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
to their chatter.
 Dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won.
 Both Kuragin
and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces
of Petersburg.


"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokhov.
.
 Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.
 or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he, addressing
the Englishman.
.


"Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to
attract attention.
 The lad
jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
 Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on
his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
the left, and took up the bottle.
 Anatole brought two candles and placed
them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
 Dolokhov's
back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both
sides.
 Pierre
stood smiling but silent.


Anatole stopped him.
.
 One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from Dolokhov's back.
 "Why is it so long?" thought Pierre.
 Suddenly Dolokhov made
a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this
was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping
ledge.
 Dolokhov
jumped down.
.
.
.


"I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging the
table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out
of the window.


"No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole.
.
 Princess Anna Mikhaylovna
Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors.
 As soon as he
had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the
drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out
his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who
enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity,
offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health,
sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident
French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment
of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray
hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.
 Ask her in," she said to the footman in a sad voice,
as if saying: "Very well, finish me off.
"

A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling
daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
.
.
 and Countess Apraksina.


"That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the visitor.
 "It
seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things
that he has been expelled by the police.
 And there
was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!"

"What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!" shouted the
count, dying with laughter.
 He has lost count
of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.
 Besides, Cyril
Vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin.
 He's also my Bory's
godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the
fact.
"

"But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count; and
seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young
ladies.
 It was evident that she had
not intended her flight to bring her so far.


The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide
and threw them round the little girl who had run in.


"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name
day," said the visitor.
.
 My doll.
.
.
 She leaned against her mother
and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim
visitor could not help joining in.


"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the mother,
pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the
visitor she added: "She is my youngest girl.


Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylovna's
son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest son; Sonya, the
count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy,
had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to
restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that
shone in all their faces.
 Boris
was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate
features.

Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face
expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm.
 Having said this he glanced at Natasha.






CHAPTER XII


The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the
young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four years
older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were
Nicholas and Sonya, the niece.


"Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing
to Nicholas, "his friend Boris has become an officer, and so for
friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father,
and entering the military service, my dear.
 "He's joining the hussars.


"It's not at all from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion.
 In the midst of his talk
he glanced round at her.


"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
sleeves!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
 "Why, our mothers used
to be married at twelve or thirteen.
"

"And she's in love with Boris already.
.
 She will come running to me of her own
accord in the evening and tell me everything.


But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles generally do;
on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,
expression.


"People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make
something exceptional of them," said the visitor.
 Sonya, muttering to herself, kept looking
round toward the drawing-room door.


Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
reply.


"How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still
more, but he waited and did nothing.
.
.
"

Natasha considered.
 "All right! Then it's settled?"

A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.


"Forever?" said the little girl.
 "Till death itself?"

She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
sitting room.
.


"You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued Vera.
 "I have
nothing to complain of.
"

"Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome," said
Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
 You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis
and nothing more" (this nickname, bestowed on Vera by Nicholas,
was considered very stinging), "and your greatest pleasure is to be
unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please," she
finished quickly.
.
"

"Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas--"said
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them.


"Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses either.
 There's no one to interest himself for him.


"Has Prince Vasili aged much?" asked the countess.
 I expect he has
forgotten me.
 I am at
your command.
.
 Still,
I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him
straight out.


"My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
.
 I shall not disturb him, my friend.


"Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich," he called to a
footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who
ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.


"My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch,
"you promised me!"

The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
 This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.


"Prince, humanum est errare, * but.
" replied the doctor, swallowing
his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.



     * To err is human.


Prince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and perplexed.
.
 This is my son," she added, indicating Boris.


"Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you have
done for us.
"

"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna,"
said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner,
here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an
obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done
in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.


"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency," replied
Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque manner nor
a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and
respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.


"If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle," said
she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I know
his character: noble, upright.
.
 "Let us wait until evening.
"

"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
welfare of his soul is at stake.
" said the
princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.
 I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the prince.


"On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed,
"I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.
.
 It was the eldest who was
reading--the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna.


"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have
done your best to increase his mental sufferings.


"Hm.
 Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready--it is almost
time," she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and
busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only
busy causing him annoyance.


Olga went out.
 You will let me know when I can see
him.
 "Mr.
 He had left Moscow when Boris
was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual
impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly
smile.
 One has so
many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course.
 Well, now we
know where we are.
 "Just now they are talking about you and your
father.

But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into
Pierre's eyes.
"

Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
something disconcerting to himself.
 I understand, quite understand.
 I could not have
done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it's splendid.
 I
am very glad to have made your acquaintance.
 "Well,
what of it! I hope we'll get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris'
hand.
.


A footman came in to summon Boris--the princess was going.
 I will come and spend the night.
 He must not be left
like this.
.


"Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when they
were in the carriage.
"

The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
usual.
.
 What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his
waistcoat.
 "It's the saute, most likely," she added with a smile.
 "Well,
you see, Count, I want some money.
 and the count began bustling to get out his
pocketbook.


"This is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the deferential
young man who had entered.
 "Bring me.
.
 But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing that the count
was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of
approaching anger.
.
"

Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping.
 The countess
wept too.
.

From time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" They were
expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le terrible
dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common
sense and frank plainness of speech.
 He seemed to be condescending to his companion.
.
.
 His
conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself.


"Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich.
.
 * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
proverb says," remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of
his mouth and winking at the count.
 Berg evidently
enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,
too, might have their own interests.
 But all he said was so prettily
sedate, and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he
disarmed his hearers.
 He was in
the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact.


"Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.
" He smiled quite inappropriately.


"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very
interesting.
" was heard on all
sides.
 Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.
"

She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,
having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with the pleasure
of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
Pierre.
" She paused.
"

She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep
from laughing.


"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Marya Dmitrievna.


The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed
on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because
Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikhaylovna
with Shinshin.
 After them other couples followed, filling the
whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses
followed singly.
 The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the
band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their
places.

or "Rhine wine" as the case might be.
.
.
.
 "What are
you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the hussar, "and why are
you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?"

"I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.
 You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,"
replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, which easily carried the whole
length of the table.


"What is it?" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter's
face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a
threatening and forbidding movement of her head.


The countess tried to frown, but could not.
"

"No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?" she almost screamed; "I
want to know!"

Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests
joined in.
 The band
again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and reached across
the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with
one another.
 "But where
is Sonya?"

She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
look for her.


Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran to the
nursery, but Sonya was not there either.
 Natasha concluded that she must
be on the chest in the passage.

And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on Nurse's dirty feather
bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her,
hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively
that her bare little shoulders shook.
 Natasha wept, sitting on the blue-striped
feather bed and hugging her friend.
.
.
 have come.
.
 but still I should not cry," and she showed
a paper she held in her hand--with the verses Nicholas had written,
"still, I should not cry, but you can't.
.
.
.

And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sonya looked upon the countess as her
mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling Nicholas' career and am
heartless and ungrateful, while truly.
 God is my witness," and she
made the sign of the cross, "I love her so much, and all of you, only
Vera.
.
.
"

Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the
feather bed.


Sonya sat up.
 The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
.


"Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friend's plaits.
.
 When the music began
Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and
blushing:

"Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.
.
 She was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.


"Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?"


In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna had
been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older
visitors.
 They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and
replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom.
 He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit
up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended,
he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery,
addressing the first violin:

"Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"

This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.

(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.


And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by
a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow.


"That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.


"That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up her
sleeves and puffing heavily.

The doctors pronounced recovery impossible.
.
 are fixed and may not be o'erpassed,"
said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
listening naively to his words.
 I hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone.
"

"I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.
"

The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside Dr.


"Has he taken his medicine?"

"Yes.


"It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.


In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
"

"No, there is no change.



"I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her unchanging
stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she
prepared to listen.
"

Prince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now
on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression
which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room.


"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semenovna,"
continued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme, apparently not
without an inner struggle; "at such a moment as this one must think of
everything.
.
 I love you
all, like children of my own, as you know.
 It is no easier for me; but,
my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything.
.
 Pierre is illegitimate.
 Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.
.
"

"What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes.



     * A bastard.
"


     * And all that follows therefrom.



"I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you,
mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool," said the princess with
the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something
witty and stinging.


"My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna," began Prince Vasili impatiently,
"I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests
as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation.
 "I never wanted anything and I
don't now.


"And this is gratitude--this is recognition for those who have
sacrificed everything for his sake!" she cried.
 There are your sisters.


But the princess did not listen to him.


"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten.
 She
had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
 Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his
last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let
him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who.
 In this world one has
to be cunning and cruel.
"

"I know your heart," repeated the prince.
 I came simply to help him and you.
"

"Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing--I know!" cried the
princess.


"That's not the point, my dear.
.
 I know it was then he wrote this
vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.
 He noticed that they
had not come to the front entrance but to the back door.
 But neither
Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help
seeing these people, took any notice of them.
 "It seems to be all
right," Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhaylovna.
 She hurriedly
ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre,
who was lagging behind, to follow.
 These
men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass
and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.
 "I have loved you like a son from the first.
 Trust yourself to
me, Pierre.
 The maid with the
decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house
was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna in
passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasili and the
eldest princess were sitting close together talking.


Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
"watching over his interests" meant, but he decided that all these
things had to be.
 From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit
room adjoining the count's reception room.
 It was one of those sumptuous
but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but
even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been
spilled on the carpet.
 She felt that as she brought with her the person the
dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured.
 "What a terrible moment!"

Having said this she went up to the doctor.
 Is there
any hope?"

The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders.
 That is well!"
and he turned to go.


But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: "How is.
.
"

"He had another stroke about half an hour ago.
 He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step.

Come.
 Prince Vasili in front of the door, near the
invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on
the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,
and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward
each time he touched his forehead.
 His face wore a calm look of piety
and resignation to the will of God.
 In the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered
to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count's hand got
up and said something to the ladies.
 On leaving the bed both
Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned
to their places one after the other before the service was concluded.


The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament.
 He judged by the cautious
movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had
lifted the dying man and were moving him.
 "Catch hold from underneath.
 Here!"
exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and
the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they
were carrying were too much for them.
 It was the same as Pierre
remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to
Petersburg.
 His hands
were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward.

Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they
must look somewhere, or it meant too much.
 Once more Pierre looked
questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next.

Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right.

Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly.
 Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively
at the sick man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed
first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an
inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt.
 He made an effort to look at the servant who
stood constantly at the head of the bed.


"Wants to turn on the other side," whispered the servant, and got up to
turn the count's heavy body toward the wall.
 Whether he
noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,
or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any
rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's terror-stricken face,
and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared,
quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own
helplessness.
 At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering
in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes.
 As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
something as she whispered:

"I can't bear the sight of that woman.
 Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the small
drawing room.
 Pierre did
not eat anything though he would very much have liked to.
 He looked
inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest
princess.


"Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary," said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same
state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
"

Prince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with
one leg crossed high above the other.
 You know
how fond the count is of her.
"

The princess did not reply.
 I think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation; is it not so, Prince?"

"Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so loud
that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled.
 "Why do you
remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making
a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room? Intriguer!" she
hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.


But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
portfolio, and changed her grip.
 Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping, quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom.
 A few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
biting her underlip.


"Yes, now you may be glad!" said she; "this is what you have been
waiting for.
 He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand.
 Pierre
noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
ague.
.
 I too.
.
.
 She approached Pierre with slow, quiet
steps.
.
.
 Anna Mikhaylovna left him, and when she returned he was
fast asleep with his head on his arm.
"

Pierre was silent.
 Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to
Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing.
 He
himself undertook his daughter's education, and to develop these two
cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was
occupied.
 As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,
regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
exactitude.


The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.

The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around--all indicated
continuous, varied, and orderly activity.
" He took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
with his foot.


"From Heloise?" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still
sound, yellowish teeth.


"Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess with a timid glance and a
timid smile.


"The third, I said the third!" cried the prince abruptly, pushing the
letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the
exercise book containing geometrical figures.
.
 "It will drive all the nonsense out of your
head.
 Religious! I don't interfere with anyone's belief.
.
 Well, now go.
 She went on
reading:


All Moscow talks of nothing but war.
 I will confess to
you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for
the army was a great grief to me.
 This young man, of whom I spoke to you
last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which
one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,
he is so frank and has so much heart.

I don't know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to
let you know of it.
 Adieu! Give
my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
 Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
 Only it seems to me that Christian
love, love of one's neighbor, love of one's enemy, is worthier, sweeter,
and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can
inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.
 Yet since you
tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak
human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend
time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit.
 Let us rather read the Epistles
and Gospels.
 Let us try to conform to them and
follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble
human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all
knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom
what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He
vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.


I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival
at Bald Hills with his wife.
 Not only where you
are--at the heart of affairs and of the world--is the talk all of
war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature--which townsfolk
consider characteristic of the country--rumors of war are heard
and painfully felt.
.
 It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
people and starting to join the army.
 It seems as though mankind has forgotten the
laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of
injuries--and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing
one another.


Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!

MARY


"Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched
mine.
 From the far side of the house
through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages--twenty
times repeated--of a sonata by Dussek.


Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch.


"Why, this is a palace!" she said to her husband, looking around with
the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.


"You've grown older, Tikhon," he said in passing to the old man, who
kissed his hand.
 When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only
met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other's
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
touch.
 Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers
of music do when they hear a false note.
"

"I knew the princess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 "Ah, Andrew, I did not
see you.
 Princess Mary was
still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
of love and sadness.
 In the midst of a
description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:

"So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said sighing.
.


The face of the little princess changed.
 She sighed and said: "Yes,
quite certain.


"And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was
aware of his weaknesses.

The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
son's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
he dressed for dinner.


"Give me time to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile that
showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and
honoring him.
 Sit down and talk.
.
"

The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
description.
 Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than
this one.
"





CHAPTER XXVII


At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the
dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle
Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who
by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though the
position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
not have caused him to expect that honor.
 The prince, who generally kept
very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael
Ivanovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had
more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivanovich was "not
a whit worse than you or I.


In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen--one
behind each chair--stood waiting for the prince to enter.
 The head
butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making
signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
by which the prince was to enter.


"How thoroughly like him that is!" he said to Princess Mary, who had
come up to him.
 Everything her father did inspired her with
reverence and was beyond question.
 The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house.
 She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the
sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
him.
 That's bad!"

He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only
and not with his eyes.


The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words.

Prince Andrew" (he always spoke thus of his son) "has been telling
me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never
thought much of him.


"The past always seems good," said he, "but did not Suvorov himself
fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to
escape?"

"Who told you that? Who?" cried the prince.
 "Suvorov!.
.
.
.


The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
 Besides he began by attacking Germans.
 He made
his reputation fighting them.
 His
son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were
presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion.
.






CHAPTER XXVIII


Prince Andrew was to leave next evening.
 The little princess was
in her sister-in-law's room.
 Prince Andrew's face
looked very thoughtful and tender.
 Did he fear going to the war, or was
he sad at leaving his wife?--perhaps both, but evidently he did not
wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he
hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the
cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
expression.
 It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.


"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
 "She is quite a child: such a dear, merry
child.


"You live in the country and don't think the life terrible," he replied.
.
.

There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne.
.
 She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.
"

"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character sometimes makes
things trying for you, doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked suddenly.
.


"You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual
pride," said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts
rather than the trend of the conversation--"and that's a great sin.
 I only wish you were all as happy as I am.
 That is the only thing
that makes me unhappy.


"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.


"Think what you please! I know you are just like Father.
" (She still did not take out what
she was holding in her reticule.
) "So you promise?"

"Of course.
.


"Please, Andrew, for my sake!.
"

Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes.
 Those eyes lit
up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful.


"Thank you, my dear.


The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks.
.
.
"

As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed
her forehead.
"

On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected one
wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
sweetly.


"No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, with false curls and her mouth
full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.
 The little princess, plump and
rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking
incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases.


The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch.
 It was an autumn
night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.


"I've come to say good-by.
 These two things can be done together," he added.
 I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands.
.
.
" muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was
writing.
 "They're all like that;
one can't unmarry.
 Don't be afraid; I won't tell anyone, but you know it
yourself.
 Now come here.
"


     *Kutuzov.
 He led him to the desk, raised the
lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his
bold, tall, close handwriting.
 So remember, these are my memoirs;
hand them to the Emperor after my death.
 Now here is a Lombard bond and
a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvorov's
wars.
.
.


They stood silent, facing one another.
 Go!" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice,
opening his door.


"What is it? What?" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at
the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing
gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
 Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
dressing gown looked out.
 Though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is
always better to "bow too low than not bow low enough.
 On hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.


"A fine mess we've made of it!" he remarked.
 The company commanders ran off
to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats
were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up
to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
hum with voices.
 "Commander of the
third company!"

"Commander of the third company wanted by the general!.
.
 The general looked the captain up and down as he
came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.
.
.

"Well, why don't you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a
Hungarian?" said the commander with an austere gibe.
.
.
 nobody knows.
 "Leave indeed.
 What?" he added with renewed irritation, "I beg
you to dress your men decently.
 Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another
because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.


"H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your leg? Your leg?" shouted the
commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still
five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.

ras.
" he did not finish.


The eyes of the general and the soldier met.






CHAPTER II


"He's coming!" shouted the signaler at that moment.


The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup
with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,
drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening
his mouth awry, prepared to shout.


Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,
light blue Viennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
by six horses at a smart trot.
 The regiment roared, "Health
to your ex.
.
 len.
 At
first Kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the
general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.


From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from
the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he
darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,
it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander.
 Looking at their boots he several times shook his
head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help
noticing what a bad state of things it was.
 These gentlemen talked among themselves
and sometimes laughed.
 Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a
handsome adjutant.
 Each time the commander started and
bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same
manner.


And the latter--unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
officer as in a looking glass--started, moved forward, and answered:
"Highly satisfied, your excellency!"

"We all have our weaknesses," said Kutuzov smiling and walking away from
him.


Dolokhov, who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat, did
not wait to be called.
 "I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!"

Kutuzov turned away.
.
.
 I am the first to
apologize, you know me!.
.
 He was very pleased!" And he held out his
hand to the captain.


"It's different on different days," answered the captain.
 "Still, one must
have pity on a young man in misfortune.
.
"

Dolokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking
smile on his lips change.
 he
noticed everything.
"

"When he looked at my feet, friend.
 Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were
near him.
.
.
!" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player,
in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front
and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and
flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.
 Kutuzov and his suite were
returning to the town.
 Zherkov had met Dolokhov abroad as a private
and had not seen fit to recognize him.


"My dear fellow, how are you?" said he through the singing, making his
horse keep pace with the company.


"And how do you get on with the officers?" inquired Zherkov.
 And how have you wriggled onto the
staff?"

"I was attached; I'm on duty.
"

"I'm glad," answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.
"

"Well, that's only till the first engagement.
"

"We shall see.
"

Dolokhov smiled.
.
"

"Good health.

        To my native land.
 Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the room with the required
papers.
 I should long ago have joined the archduke.


"On the contrary," he said, in a querulous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words, "on the contrary, your
excellency's participation in the common action is highly valued by
His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles," he concluded his evidently
prearranged sentence.
 "Please
have a look at it"--and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners
of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in
German, from the Archduke Ferdinand's letter:


We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech.
 We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial
Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with
it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.
 He now looked like a man who has time
to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with
agreeable and interesting work.


Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,
promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,
and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.

From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew's father.



On Kutuzov's staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally,
Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite
opposite reputations.
"

"And why is it?"

Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.

Prince Andrew stopped short.


"The commander in chief is engaged," said Kozlovski, going hurriedly up
to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door.


"There's nothing to be gay about," answered Bolkonski.
.


The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing
the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment's
attention.
 He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
 The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkov's untimely jest.



     * "Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!"

     * (2) "It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow
     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for
     you.


On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
of Mack's defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
proceeding as usual.
 It was
evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid
to serve him.
 His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in
hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face
immediately brightened on seeing Rostov.
 "Schon gut Morgen! Schon gut
Morgen!" * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to
greet the young man.



    * "A very good morning! A very good morning!"


"Schon fleissig?" * said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which
did not leave his eager face.
 "He's coming!" said
he.
 Denisov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black
eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair.
 If we could only get to fighting soon.
 Hullo, who's there?"
he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the
clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.


"Ah! Telyanin! How d'ye do? They plucked me last night," came Denisov's
voice from the next room.
 I knew it," replied a piping voice,
and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered
the room.


Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
which was offered him.
 Telyanin for some reason had been transferred
from the Guards just before this campaign.
.
" he added.
"

"Then I'll have it brought round," said Rostov wishing to avoid
Telyanin, and he went out to give the order.
 I only came round to ask Denisov about yesterday's
order.
 But where are you off to?"

"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.


When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
table.
 He looked gloomily in Rostov's face and said: "I am witing to
her.
 We are
childwen of the dust.
.
.


"Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know," said
Rostov, blushing.
 Really I have some," Rostov repeated.


"I haven't been in the room.
.
 All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere
below his throat rushed to his face and eyes.
 It must be here somewhere," said Lavrushka.
"

"I know who has taken it," repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice, and
went to the door.
 So that if it is not
so, then.


"The master is not in, he's gone to headquarters," said Telyanin's
orderly.
 "Has something happened?" he added, surprised at the cadet's
troubled face.


The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and
Rostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there.
 No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
and the munching of the lieutenant.


"Allow me to look at your purse," he said in a low, almost inaudible,
voice.


With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed him the
purse.
 "That money is Denisov's; you took it.
 As soon as Rostov heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell
from him.
"

Every muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to quiver, his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
to Rostov's face, and his sobs were audible.
.
.
.
"

Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin's eyes, and went out of the
room without a word.
 But at the door he stopped and then retraced his
steps.
.
 "Now then,
Wostov, now then!"

 Rostov, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one
officer and then at the other.


"No, gentlemen, no.
.
 I quite understand.
 I.
.
 for the honor of the
regiment I'd.
.


"I tell you," shouted Denisov, "he's a fine fellow.
 "Go and
apologize, your excellency.


"He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,"
muttered Denisov.


"Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss my path.
.
"

"Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these last two days.
 On October 23 the
Russian troops were crossing the river Enns.


It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day.
 The wide expanse that opened out
before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and
then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could
be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished.


Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through
his fieldglass.
.


"So they will," said Nesvitski.


Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
the general, who looked through his field glass.
"

"Crew, to your guns!" commanded the officer.


"One!" came the command.
 Everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly
visible as if but a stone's throw away, and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off.
 Each time Prince
Nesvitski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and
pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.
 "Hi there, boys! Keep to the
left! Wait a bit.
 Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;
sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,
an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and
sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers' or company's
baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides,
moved across the bridge.
"

That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.


"Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?" said an orderly,
running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.

And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvitski did not learn who had been
struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.
 Every face bore
almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.


The girl smiled and took it.
 See, here's an officer jammed in
too"--different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at
one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.


The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
Denisov joined Nesvitski.


"They don't even give one time to dwink!" answered Vaska Denisov.
"

"What a dandy you are today!" said Nesvitski, looking at Denisov's new
cloak and saddlecloth.
 You'd look fine,"
said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
weight of his knapsack.


"Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!" the
hussar shouted back.






CHAPTER VIII


The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel.
 At last
the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
battalion came onto the bridge.
 The
weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly
upon the Danube and the dark hills around it.
 The
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places.
 All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
commander, awaiting the word of command.
 A second and a third cannon
ball flew past.
 The quartermaster frowned, looking at the
soldiers as if threatening to punish them.
 "It won't come to a fight.
 Rostov felt
perfectly happy.
"

The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
having lost a single man.


The two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the
hill one after the other.
 Rostov, feeling
that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the
colonel's athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red
neck.
"

"An order to who?" asked the colonel morosely.


"On the same business.
.
.


"I will the bridge fire," he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing.
 Rostov watched his enemy,
the colonel, closely--to find in his face confirmation of his own
conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov, and looked as
he always did when at the front, solemn and stern.


"Look sharp! Look sharp!" several voices repeated around him.


Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do.


Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not
looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,
and fell on his hands.


"At boss zides, Captain," he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
triumphant, cheerful face.
 But Bogdanich, without looking at or recognizing Rostov, shouted
to him:

"Who's that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come
back, Cadet!" he cried angrily; and turning to Denisov, who, showing off
his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:

"Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount," he said.
"

"There now!" said the officer of the suite, "that's grapeshot.
 "I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I
were there," thought Rostov.
.
 groans, suffering, fear, and this
uncertainty and hurry.
.
 Another instant and I shall never again see
the sun, this water, that gorge!.


The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices
sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.


"It's all over; but I am a coward--yes, a coward!" thought Rostov, and
sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot,
from the orderly and began to mount.


"Was that grapeshot?" he asked Denisov.
 "See if I don't get
promoted to a sublieutenancy.

The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of.


On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the
left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time
with the river between himself and the main body of the French.
 His horse had been
wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet.
 Some of them were talking (he heard Russian
words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked
silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy
hurrying past them.
.
 Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
rapidity.
 He vividly imagined the casual
questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give.
 The
adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.


Prince Andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the minister's room.
 A wax candle stood at each side of the minister's bent
bald head with its gray temples.


Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov's army interested
the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was
concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that
impression.
 The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them
evenly, and then raised his head.
 His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which
does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is
continually receiving many petitioners one after another.
 "What a calamity!
What a calamity!"

Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.


"Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
not captured.
 "I am very glad you have brought good
news, though Schmidt's death is a heavy price to pay for the victory.
 I thank
you! You must have a rest.
"

The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
reappeared.
 Bilibin
settled down comfortably beside the fire.


After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince
Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood.
 He still a young man but
no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age
of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather
important post in Vienna.
 It was not the question "What for?"
but the question "How?" that interested him.
 What the diplomatic matter
might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly.

Bilibin's services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for
his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.
 His small, deep-set eyes always
twinkled and looked out straight.


"Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier
and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!
Where's the victory?"

"But seriously," said Prince Andrew, "we can at any rate say without
boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm.
"

"Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?"

"Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of
a parade.
.
 Mack loses
a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs
of life and make blunder after blunder.
 The
Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself.

Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke
Karl gained a victory, what effect would that have on the general course
of events? It's too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French
army!"

"What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?"

"Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count, our
dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.
.
 No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I
hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been given to
blow it up.

"The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor
Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the
Allies, Austria's hand will be forced and there will be war.
 And
therefore--this is between ourselves--I instinctively feel that we are
being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and
projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.



"Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew.
 * This set, consisting almost exclusively of
diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to
the official side of the service.


"Tell me about that!" he said.


"The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance," began
Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, "without
expressing.


"Well now, gentlemen," said Bilibin, "Bolkonski is my guest in this
house and in Brunn itself.
 You can
undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the
women.


"I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I
can't," replied Bolkonski, smiling.
 Then followed other questions just as simple:
"Was Kutuzov well? When had he left Krems?" and so on.


"At what o'clock did the battle begin?" asked the Emperor.


"At what o'clock was General Schmidt killed?"

"At seven o'clock, I believe.
"

"At seven o'clock? It's very sad, very sad!"

The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed.
 The archduchess
also wished to see him.
 He did not know whom to answer, and for a few
seconds collected his thoughts.
 A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutuzov was awarded
the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.
 Franz,
Bilibin's man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of
the front door.
 The
scoundrel is again at our heels!"

"Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew.


"But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town
knows?"

"I come from the archduchess'.
"

"And you didn't see that everybody is packing up?"

"I did not.
 No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.


As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!
Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the
executing of the plan.
 These
gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they
assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to
negotiate with Prince Auersperg.
 The officer sends for
Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the
cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved,
flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches
the tete-de-pont.
 'Dearest foe! Flower of the
Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can
shake one another's hand.
.
 The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience
to make Prince Auersperg's acquaintance.

"The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the
bridge is taken! But what is best of all," he went on, his excitement
subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, "is that the
sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French
troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes
stayed his hand.
"--he seemed to be trying to find the right
expression.
.
.
 it
is a bit of Mack.


"Do you know, mon cher," said Bilibin following him, "I have been
thinking about you.


Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.


"But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other
side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,
is to take care of yourself.
.
 They say we are going to Olmutz, and Olmutz is a very
decent town.
 Prince Andrew
took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and
weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the
commander in chief and of his own luggage.
 Very sinister reports of the
position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of
the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.
 "And should there be nothing left but to die?" he
thought.
 From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear
could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts
and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the
urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.
 At
each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
din of shouting more incessant.
 Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:

"Mr.
 Aide-de-camp!.
.
.
.
.
.


Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,
tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying.
 Before the officer finished his sentence Prince
Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his
riding whip.
.
"

Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
doctor's wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with
a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief
was.
.


Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and another adjutant
having something to eat.
 On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.


"Where is the commander in chief?" asked Bolkonski.


He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife and
the convoy officer.
 In the passage little Kozlovski was
squatting on his heels in front of a clerk.
 He glanced at
Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.
 have you written it?" he continued dictating to the
clerk.
 "The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian.


Through the door came the sounds of Kutuzov's voice, excited and
dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice.
"

Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.


"Well, have you finished?" said he to Kozlovski.


"I have the honor to present myself," repeated Prince Andrew rather
loudly, handing Kutuzov an envelope.
 "My blessing, and may
Christ be with you in your great endeavor!"

His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes.


"Christ be with you!" Kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage.


"That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment," he said.






CHAPTER XIV


On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he
commanded was in an almost hopeless position.
 If he reached Znaim before the
French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the
French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction.
 But to forestall
the French with his whole army was impossible.
 The road for the French
from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
Russians from Krems to Znaim.
 You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign.
 Inform him that the
general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.
.
.
 Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
escape, and Bagration's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time
for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
for him.
 The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a
diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though
he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.
 It won't take a moment.
"

"Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese," said
Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.


"Now what does this mean, gentlemen?" said the staff officer, in the
reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than
once.

"One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good
example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded
and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots!" (The staff
officer smiled.
) "Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you,
all!" he added in a tone of command.


"The soldiers say it feels easier without boots," said Captain Tushin
smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt
a jocular tone.
 But before he had finished he felt that his jest was
unacceptable and had not come off.
 He grew confused.


Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small figure.

There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,
but extremely attractive.


Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking
soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some
entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up
red.
 From there the French could already be
seen.
 "It's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots.


The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and
cheerful were the troops.
 The greatest disorder and depression had been
in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven
miles away from the French.


A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
as he rode by.
 Besides the soldiers who
formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers
who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.
 Prince Andrew
recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying.
 The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was
trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all
the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained that the Russians had not
surrendered but had beaten the French.


The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
"


"Qu' est-ce qu'il chante?" * asked a Frenchman.



    * "What's he singing about?"


"It's ancient history," said another, guessing that it referred to a
former war.
"

"Bonaparte.
.


"Ah, that's the way to talk French," said the picket soldiers.






CHAPTER XVI


Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince
Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him the whole field could be seen.
 Before the guns an
artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the
officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.

Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
and artillerymen's bonfires.
 To the left, not far from the farthest
cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
sound of officers' voices in eager conversation.
 Just facing
it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schon Grabern
could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops
amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were
evidently in the village itself and behind the hill.
 To the left from
that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it
was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye.

On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the
bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood.
 Prince Andrew took
out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the
position.
 He imagined
only important possibilities: "If the enemy attacks the right flank,"
he said to himself, "the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must
hold their position till reserves from the center come up.
.
 Suddenly, however,
he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so
sincere that he could not but listen.
 That's so, friend.
 "One is afraid of the unknown, that's what it is.
.
 we know there is no sky but only
an atmosphere.
"

The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
.
 Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and
nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it
had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near
the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth.


And immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and
his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed
by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried
off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.
 Two
mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill.
 Evidently our guns had begun to reply.

From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came
the report of musketry.


"It has begun.

Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly.


"It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince," said the staff officer.
 It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind
no longer in general use.
 "Very good!" said Bagration in reply to the officer's report,
and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before
him.
 Below the height on
which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet
flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard,
and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the
suite pointed out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us.


As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and
as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in command
(the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at Braunau) that
he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,
as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's
attack very long.
 Prince Andrew listened
attentively to Bagration's colloquies with the commanding officers and
the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were
really given, but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that
everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate
commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord
with his intentions.
 There was a gurgle in his throat and he
was spitting blood.
 Some
were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or
taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who
they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
wind to carry away.
 All he knew was that at the commencement
of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted "Cavalry!" and our
men had begun firing.
 The staff officer joined in the colonel's
appeals, but Bagration did not reply; he only gave an order to
cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching
battalions.


With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with
his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full
height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy
tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him.
.
 left.
.
" he seemed to repeat to himself at
each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied faces,
the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in
step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating
to himself at each alternate step, "Left.
.
 A cannon ball, cleaving the air,
flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell into the
column to the measure of "Left.
.
 left!" "Close up!" came the company
commander's voice in jaunty tones.
.
 left.
.


"Glad to do our best, your ex'len-lency!" came a confused shout from
the ranks.
 Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
forward, and experienced great happiness.
 (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs
and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.
 The two commanders were much
exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on
the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged
in discussion with the sole object of offending one another.


"Once again, Colonel," said the general, "I can't leave half my men
in the wood.
.
 They
reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in
silence.
 The general and colonel looked
sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks
preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice
in the other.


The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put
to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having
his own way, gave an order.
 No one said anything definite, but the rumor
of an attack spread through the squadron.
 The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars
alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this
irresolution communicated itself to the men.


"If only they would be quick!" thought Rostov, feeling that at last
the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heard from his fellow hussars.
 Rook pulled at the
reins and started of his own accord.
 He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him.
 This tree had been
in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible--and now he
had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but
everything was becoming more and more happy and animated.
 "Oh, how I
will slash at him!" thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.
 Ahead, the enemy was already
visible.
 He was alone in the middle of a field.


Having disentangled his leg, he rose.
 "Where, on which side, was now the
line that had so sharply divided the two armies?" he asked himself and
could not answer.
 Then
came two more, and many more running behind.
 One of them said something
strange, not in Russian.
 He did not now run with the
feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge,
but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds.
 He could run no more.
 Rostov closed his eyes and stooped
down.


"Surrounded! Cut off? We're lost!" shouted the fugitives.


The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair.
 "The whole company can bear witness.
 I beg you will remember
this, your excellency!"

"All right, all right," replied the commander, and turned to Major
Ekonomov.
 I remained at the front.


All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the
direction of the conflagration.
 The soldiers, for the
most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery
company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their
officer--all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing
situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on
theirs.


From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and
thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces
of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men
and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy's side (always
followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a
horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his
own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him
pleasure.
"

"What do you want, your honor?" asked an artilleryman, standing close
by, who heard him muttering.


He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing
cannon balls at the French with both hands.
 It was the staff officer who had turned
him out of the booth at Grunth.
.
.

He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball
stopped him.


The soldiers laughed.
 A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same
order.
 One ball after another passed over as he approached
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine.
 "I cannot be afraid," thought he, and
dismounted slowly among the guns.
 They were both so busy as to seem
not to notice one another.


"Well, till we meet again.
" he said, holding out his hand to Tushin.
 The
cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on
the right sounded oftener and nearer.
 Tushin gave no orders, and,
silently--fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep
without knowing why--rode behind on his artillery nag.
 "For God's
sake.
 "And where is the wounded
officer?"

"He has been set down.


"Help him up.


"What, are you wounded, my lad?" said Tushin, approaching the gun on
which Rostov sat.
 This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers
who had sheltered in the village houses.


"We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't make another push now," said
another.
 Rostov, too, dragged himself to the
fire.
 From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole
body.
 He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,
which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered
figure of Tushin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.
 An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held
his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.


"You don't mind your honor?" he asked Tushin.
 I don't know where.
 After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to
the campfire.
 They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.


Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.


Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed
by the fire.


"He's dead--why carry him?" said another.


"Yes.
"

"I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there, your excellency," chimed in
Zherkov, looking uneasily around.
 (Prince
Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all
the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.
)
"I think I sent you?" he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.
.


Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the
village and had already been sent for.
 Several of those present laughed.
 He had been so excited that
he had not thought about it until that moment.
.
"

"You might have taken some from the covering troops.
"

Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that
was perfectly true.


"Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!" said Tushin.


He opened his eyes and looked up.
 The black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal.

Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage.
 Had he
thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and
shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
above and below him in social standing.
 Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre
took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.
 From the death of Count
Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad.
"

"Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last," said Prince Vasili
one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre's elbow, speaking as if
he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could
not now be altered.
 "We start tomorrow and I'm giving you a place in
my carriage.
 I asked him for you, and you have been
entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber.
 But you will see everything for yourself when you get to
Petersburg.


In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection.
 He could not refuse the post, or rather the
rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasili had procured for him,
and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous
that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,
and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never
attained.

The Guards had gone to the front; Dolokhov had been reduced to the
ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew
was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with
a friend older than himself and whom he respected.


In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
Pavlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: "You
will find the beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful to
see.
 Pierre felt flattered by this.
 Another group was at the tea table.
 Go and keep her company for ten minutes.
"

The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre, looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.
 Don't you think so? I
only wanted to know your opinion," and Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go.
 On leaving them, Anna Pavlovna again
touched Pierre's sleeve, saying: "I hope you won't say that it is dull
in my house again," and she glanced at Helene.
 Princess Helene asked to see the
portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid.
 "You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who
may belong to anyone--to you too," said her glance.
 He could not, any more
than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
once recognized it to be a tuft of grass.
 Don't be angry with me for exercising an old woman's privilege.
 Pierre did not look at
Helene nor she at him.

I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she
with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that's why he was sent
away.
 Prince Vasili is her father.
.
 It's
bad.
 He recalled Anna Pavlovna's words
and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of
such hints from Prince Vasili and others, and was seized by terror lest
he had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was
evidently wrong and that he ought not to do.






CHAPTER II


In November, 1805, Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in
four different provinces.
"

Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" and after the sleepless night
when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and that he
ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not
left Prince Vasili's and felt with terror that in people's eyes he was
every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for
him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break
away from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would
have to unite his fate with hers.
 Prince Vasili, in the
rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre's hand in passing
and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled,
clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: "Till tomorrow,"
or, "Be in to dinner or I shall not see you," or, "I am staying in for
your sake," and so on.
 Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she
is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he sometimes said to himself
"she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid.
 She says little,
but what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid.

She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad
woman!" He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in
her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but
appropriate remark--showing that it did not interest her--or by a silent
look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her
superiority.
 At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and
there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Helene, side by
side.
 Prince Vasili was not having any supper: he went round the table
in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests.
 He enlivened
the whole party.
 At the center of the table, Prince Vasili
attracted everybody's attention.
 With a facetious smile on his face, he
was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's meeting of the Imperial
Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military governor
general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript
of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the
Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of
the people's loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him
particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a
nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it.
 This rescript began with
the words: "Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me," etc.
.
.
.
 From all sides.
 "He is such a worthy and excellent man, our
dear Vyazmitinov.

But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they
enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however they avoided
looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed
of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the
story about Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a
pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was directed
to--Pierre and Helene.
 Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing of Sergey
Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and
while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said: "Yes.
 Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked
at the beautiful Helene with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and
happy though uneasy face of Pierre.

He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly.


Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what.
 "And besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did
it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasili.

Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second
time.
"

Prince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
him and Helene.


"When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?" repeated Prince
Vasili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.
 He pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's happiness.
 "Oh, the old fool,"
he thought.


While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time
alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting.


Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then, and Prince
Vasili saw that Pierre knew this.


Prince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on
a sofa in a far corner of the room.


"Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what they are about.


Prince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him.
 With quick steps he went
joyfully up to Pierre.
" (His voice trembled.
.
.
.
"

He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his
malodorous mouth.


"All this had to be and could not be otherwise," thought Pierre, "so
it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad.
 Her face flushed.


"Oh, take those off.
.


"Je vous aime!" * he said, remembering what has to be said at such
moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.
 "I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall
think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same
time, my honored benefactor," wrote Prince Vasili.
 He snorted whenever he mentioned
him.
 Whether he was in a bad
temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili's visit, he was in a
bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect
not to go to the prince with his report.
 It had snowed the day
before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the
habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still
visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path.
 "God be thanked,"
thought the overseer, "the storm has blown over!"

"It would have been hard to drive up, your honor," he added.
 "You thought!.
.

What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.
"

The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.


His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
flung it away.
 When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald
Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole
days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her
about the old prince and criticized him.


"Hm!--his excellency is a puppy.
.
" (He looked at his blushing daughter.
 The little princess
was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her maid.
 Her cheeks
had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.
"

He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with
bowed head.


"Has the snow been shoveled back?"

"Yes, your excellency.
.

Prince Vasili's two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round
with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered, as if to say: "Yes, that's how I want you to look.


"Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
with the old prince.
 "I can't bear
those old men! Eh?"

"Remember, for you everything depends on this.


She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,
but had on one of her best dresses.
 Some unobtrusive touch
had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.

"They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!"

The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be
dressed.

To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would
prolong their banter and insistence.


"No, it will not do," she said decidedly, clasping her hands.


"Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming," she said.


"No, leave me alone," said Princess Mary.


Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once.
 "Didn't I
tell you," she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne,
"Mary's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least.


"You will change it, won't you?" said Lise.
 And as Princess Mary gave no
answer, she left the room.
 She fancied a child, her own--such as she had
seen the day before in the arms of her nurse's daughter--at her own
breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child.
 The prince will be out in a moment," came the
maid's voice at the door.
 Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a
man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of
happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing
was for earthly love.
 "Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be
not anxious or envious.
 Man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden
from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything.
 If it be
God's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill
His will.
 It was as if he said
to them: "I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you?
You'd be only too glad, of course.
 She met Prince Vasili with that
playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting
in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves
there are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing
reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist--just as none
existed in this case.
 "It's not as at Annette's * receptions where you
always ran away; you remember cette chere Annette!"


    * Anna Pavlovna.
 Oh!" and she shook her finger at
him, "I have even heard of your doings in Paris!"

"And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked Prince Vasili, turning to his son
and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would have run away and
he had just managed to catch her, "didn't he tell you how he himself was
pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she
is a pearl among women, Princess," he added, turning to Princess Mary.
 Anatole answered the
Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her
about her native land.
 When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.

"Not at all bad!" he thought, examining her, "not at all bad, that
little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we're
married, la petite est gentille.
 "What are
Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince Vasili is a shallow
braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen," he grumbled to
himself.
 The
prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life.
 "Well, I've nothing
against it," the prince said to himself, "but he must be worthy of her.
 He noticed the change in the little princess' dress,
Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's unbecoming coiffure,
Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, and the loneliness of his
daughter amid the general conversation.
 "She is shameless, and he ignores
her!"

He went straight up to Prince Vasili.
 "Here is my second son; please love and
befriend him.


"And so they are writing from Potsdam already?" he said, repeating
Prince Vasili's last words.

"Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the
visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are
never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.


"On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well," said
Prince Vasili.


"Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been educated abroad, not taught to
read and write by the deacon, like your father and me.
 So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar
and the country? It is wartime.
.


"You may go," he said to Anatole.
 He can stay and I'll
see.
 "You know, you see right through people.
 She felt convinced of that.
 Thousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination.
 "I try to be
reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already,
but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do
not like him.
"

And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new
guest.
 And now he, a real Russian prince, had
appeared.


The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
struggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.


"How she loves me!" thought Princess Mary.
 She did not know how she found the courage,
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
shortsighted eyes.
 And
smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.


"Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind--yes, kind,
that is the chief thing," thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had
seldom experienced, came upon her.
 Every position was
awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because Anatole's presence had vividly recalled to her the time
when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay.
 She
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy
and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
time, muttering to herself.

"I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it's not my fault!" and her
voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
.
 fr! And don't I see that that idiot had eyes only for
Bourienne--I shall have to get rid of her.
 And how is it she has not
pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne.
.
 but
I'll let her see.
 "I never
invited them.


Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his
master's thoughts.
.
.
.
" said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet
into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he
went to the couch on which he slept.
 What about you? That's what I want to know.
"

The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never.
 The old
prince interrupted her.
 "He will take you with your dowry and
take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain.
 She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.


"Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he said.
 I give you freedom.
 But what her father had said
about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful.
 She could not understand it.


"No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!" said Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
"

"But you despise me.

Then, sighing, he added: "My son's fate is in your hands.


"Fr.
.
 I don't wish to marry," she answered positively, glancing at
Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes.


"Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!" cried Prince Bolkonski,
frowning and taking his daughter's hand; he did not kiss her, but only
bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so
that she winced and uttered a cry.


"My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
forget.
 But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart, so kind and generous? Say 'perhaps'.
'"

"Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart.
 And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amelie's
happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents.
 I shall be so
happy when she is his wife.
.
 Not till
midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's
handwriting.


Anna Mikhaylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,
on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same
time.
.
 promoted to be an officer.
.
 thank God.
 Natasha, who, of the whole
family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning
of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
father and Anna Mikhaylovna, that it had something to do with her
brother, and that Anna Mikhaylovna was preparing them for it.
 Bold as
she was, Natasha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
relating to Nikolenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
chair regardless of her governess' remarks.


"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"

"Nothing, my dear.


"But for God's sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma.
"

"I will, I will, only tell me! You won't? Then I will go and tell at
once.


"No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself, "I won't
tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.


"There now! It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya,
pacing the room with large, resolute strides.
 "Now I'm very glad, very
glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.
 You are all
blubberers and understand nothing.


"You haven't read the letter?" asked Sonya.
 "What nasty brutes they are! I'd have killed so
many that there'd have been a heap of them.
 She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there was such
love as Sonya was speaking of.


Sonya became thoughtful.
"

"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris.


The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna's hints at dinner.
 Anna Mikhaylovna, with the letter, came on
tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.

Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss,
and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him "dear Sonya, whom he
loved and thought of just the same as ever.
 "From all he says one should be
glad and not cry.
 "And who is it she takes after?" thought the
countess.
 How strange, how extraordinary, how
joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had
first learned to say "pear" and then "granny," that this son should now
be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior
doing some kind of man's work of his own, without help or guidance.
 As twenty
years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to
speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this
letter, he now was.
 "And what a soul! Not a word about
himself.
 He says nothing about his
sufferings.
.
 The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent
the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight
to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.

Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after
their active service, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed
with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts
of tempting wares.


The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading
their cleanliness and discipline.

Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.


"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.


"Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them!" said Boris.
.
 Well, how are you? Been
under fire already?" asked Boris.
 "And we too have had a
splendid march.
 What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls!
I can't tell you.
 After reading a few lines, he
glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
letter.


"Well, they've sent you a tidy sum," said Berg, eying the heavy purse
that sank into the sofa.
 I
can tell you for myself.
.
"

"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you get a letter from
home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything
over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of
your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere.
.


Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having
assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had been
noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.


"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the letter.


"It is some letter of recommendation.
.
 what the devil do I want it
for!"

"Why 'What the devil'?" said Boris, picking it up and reading the
address.
"

"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant.


"It's a lackey's job!"

"You are still the same dreamer, I see," remarked Boris, shaking his
head.


"Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked Boris.


Again Rostov looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed.
 So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so
my conscience was at ease.
.
.
) "Well, he stormed at me, as the saying
is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but
rather of death, as the saying is.
 'Hey, are you dumb?' he
shouted.
 And what do you think, Count? The
next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day.
 He asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound.
 Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no
account have told a deliberate lie.
 He began his story meaning to tell
everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and
inevitably he lapsed into falsehood.


In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: "You cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack," Prince Andrew,
whom Boris was expecting, entered the room.
 Having been sent with
papers from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to
find him alone.


"As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris, "we
will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rostov).
 "Yes, many stories! But our
stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire! Our
stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the
staff who get rewards without doing anything!"

"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and
particularly amiable smile.
 Au revoir!" exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them
both he went out.


From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up
on the field before the fortress.
 Not only the
generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and
wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded
officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed
till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
smooth--felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and
solemn affair.
 The ranks were drawn up on
the vast field.


From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen
approaching.


Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which the Tsar
approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in
that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of
might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
triumph.
.
 Then the general march, and again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing
ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.
 Every trait and every
movement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.
 He longed to show that love in
some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry.

Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at
last only his white plumes were visible to Rostov from amid the suites
that surrounded the Emperors.
 Commanded by the Emperor himself
they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought
Rostov and most of the officers after the review.


All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
would have made them.
 One adjutant, nearest the door, was
sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.


When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with
that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, "If it
were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment"), was listening
to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost
on tiptoe, with a soldier's obsequious expression on his purple face,
reporting something.


"I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday.
 I was fussing about
with Germans all day.
 He turned away and
waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return from the commander in
chief's room.
 So we will go to
Dolgorukov; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him
about you.
 We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find
a place for you somewhere nearer the sun.
 Under cover of obtaining help
of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for
himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
which attracted him.


It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz
occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.
 Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to
Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the
Emperors' presence were eager for action.
.
 merely to gain time.


"That's just it," interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, laughing.
 He suggested addressing him as
'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.
 "But you see.


"Who was that?" asked Boris.
 Rostov saw the Cossacks and then
the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions
and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and
Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants.
 All the fear before action
which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to
conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true
hussar in this battle, had been wasted.
 Evidently the affair was over and,
though not big, had been a successful engagement.
 He brought with him into our rearguard all the
freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.
 In a moment everyone
was in his place, waiting.


Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.
 He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
day he had lost.


"The reserves, sire!" replied a voice, a very human one compared to that
which had said: "The Pavlograd hussars?"

The Emperor drew level with Rostov and halted.
 It
shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face
of the majestic Emperor.
 In Wischau
itself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor again.
 In the
market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
Emperor's arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
had not been time to move.
 Rostov saw how the Emperor's rather round
shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left
foot began convulsively tapping the horse's side with the spur, and how
the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir.
 The Emperor's gratitude was announced to the vanguard,
rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka.


When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled
others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the
soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest
showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light
of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.


The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.


Late that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his short hand
patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.
.

He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian
arms and the hope of future triumph.
 And he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the
Russian arms.
 This officer was Savary.
 By
evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army,
and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty
thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices,
and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.
 Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a
neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever
catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.


At six in the evening, Kutuzov went to the Emperor's headquarters and
after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.
 How is your old fellow?
Out of sorts?"

"I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard.


"Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov," he continued, "we should be
a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance
to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands!
No, we mustn't forget Suvorov and his rule--not to put yourself in a
position to be attacked, but yourself to attack.
 If he
is standing before Brunn.
.
 As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate
the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince
Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the
map, but at Prince Andrew's face.


"There will be a council of war at Kutuzov's tonight, though; you can
say all this there," remarked Dolgorukov.
 What do you think he replied? 'But, my dear
general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters
yourself!' Yes.
.
 That was the answer I got!"





CHAPTER XII


Shortly after nine o'clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans
to Kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to be held.


Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war.
 He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,
without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to
questions put to him.


"Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin," said Weyrother,
hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an
enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out.
 Weyrother, with
the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutuzov and,
having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in
a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:

"Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and
Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.
 For this object it is necessary that.
.
 The third
column marches.
.


Przebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
attention.
 Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with
an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map
conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality.
 Weyrother complied and Dohkturov
noted them down.


"So you think he is powerless?" said Langeron.


"He has forty thousand men at most," replied Weyrother, with the smile
of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a
case.


"Ma foi!" said he, "tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield.
 "What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which
is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.
" (He
smiled ironically.
) "But even if he also took up a position in the
Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.
 But before a battle, there is nothing more
important.
 The generals bowed and retired.
 He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and
for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out
of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up
and down before it.
 Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on
dreaming of his triumphs.
.


"Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line.
 On this knoll
there was a white patch that Rostov could not at all make out: was it
a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some
white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot.
 "I
expect it's snow.
.
.
 Na.
 How shall
I speak to the Emperor? No, that's not it--that's tomorrow.
 Oh yes!
Natasha.
.
.
.
 No, it was I who dared not.

But that's nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important
thing I was thinking of.
 All at once it
seemed to him that he was being fired at.
.
 At the moment he opened his eyes
he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn shouts
of thousands of voices.
.
 The lights spread farther and
farther, probably along the line of the French camp.
"

"Hardly," said Bagration.


"Yes, sir.
 Bagration called to him from
the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostov pretended not to hear
him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes
for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.
 And
before Rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had
suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,
and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
out of hearing.
 Four more reports followed
at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones.


"Very good, very good," said Bagration.
 May I ask to be attached to
the first squadron?"

"What's your name?"

"Count Rostov.
"

"Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor,"
thought Rostov.
 I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor
carry disorder and confusion into the enemy's ranks, but should victory
be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing
himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of
victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of
the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.


Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will
conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh
French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace
I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.


NAPOLEON





CHAPTER XIV


At five in the morning it was still quite dark.
 The smoke of the campfires, into which they were
throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart.
 It was cold and
dark.
 Austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds
of the advance.
 The
column moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses
around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the place
they were leaving or that to which they were going.
 How such
a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it
certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,
and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek.
 And now here we stand hungry.


Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.
 The fog that
was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were
descending.
 Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
knew till after eight o'clock.


It was nine o'clock in the morning.
 The fog lay unbroken like a sea down
below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood
with his marshals around him, it was quite light.
 Napoleon, in the blue cloak
which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab
horse a little in front of his marshals.
 His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one
spot.
 Part of the Russian force
had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack
and regarded as the key to the position.
 He saw over the mist that in
a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian
columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one
direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
the mist.
 But still he did not
begin the engagement.
 The marshals stood
behind him not venturing to distract his attention.
 Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince
Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.


To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces
could be heard.
 "There we shall encounter difficulties, and there," thought
he, "I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in
hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me.

Seeing them he kept thinking, "That may be the very standard with which
I shall lead the army.
 In front and
behind moved infantry.
.
"

"Yes, sir.
"

"My dear fellow," Nesvitski whispered to Prince Andrew, "the old man is
as surly as a dog.
 Seeing him, Kutuzov's malevolent and
caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done
was not his adjutant's fault, and still not answering the Austrian
adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.


Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
 Kutuzov
still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes.
 These were the two Emperors
followed by their suites.
 Czartoryski,
Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and the others, all richly
dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly
heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the
Emperor.
 Among them were grooms leading the
Tsar's beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths.
 But the Emperor
Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.


The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Novgorod and
one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.


"It's the enemy?.
.
.


"The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency," cried he.
 Nesvitski with an angry face, red and unlike
himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once
he would certainly be taken prisoner.


"You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his
lower jaw.


The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
them it was difficult to get out again.
 Having
by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutuzov,
with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of
artillery fire near by.
 But
he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front
of him--at the battery.
 But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended.


Bagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,
and the boyish face Rostov, breathless with excitement and hope, was the
first to catch his eye.


On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few
hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with
elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that
state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.
 The morning
was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of
joy and happiness.


In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots
at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
general roar.
 These sights
and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the
contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.
 A handful of men came
galloping toward him.
 The heavy black horse, sixteen hands
high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove
his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and
extending its neck, galloped on yet faster.


"Rostov!"

"What?" he answered, not recognizing Boris.


"I say, we've been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!" said Boris
with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under
fire for the first time.
 Rostov without hearing Boris to the end
spurred his horse.


"Count! Count!" shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager
as Boris.
 "The enemy in the rear of our army?
Impossible!" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle.


"The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all up now!" he
was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
understood what was happening as little as he did.


"My God! What does it all mean?" thought he.
.
 But no, these must be only a handful
of scoundrels.
 It will soon be over, it can't be that, it can't be! Only
to get past them quicker, quicker!"

The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov's head.
 Though he
saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he
had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did
not wish to, believe that.






CHAPTER XVIII


Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the
village of Pratzen.
 But neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds.
 The highroad on
which he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all
sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and
some not.
 This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
stationed on the Pratzen Heights.


"Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!" said the soldier, laughing
for some reason and shaking himself free.


Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped the
horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
question him.
 "I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I've seen
him in Petersburg.
 "The commander in chief? He was killed
by a cannon ball--struck in the breast before our regiment.
.
 there are not
many left alive.
 The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost.
 Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which
he saw turrets and a church.


"It's all the same now.
 If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save
myself?" he thought.
 He rode on to the region where the greatest number
of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen.
 He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all
these suffering men, and he felt afraid--afraid not for his life, but
for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of
these unfortunates.
 He remembered his mother's last letter.
 The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
sounded far away.
 No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the Emperor
or Kutuzov was.
 When he had
ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he
saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback
facing the ditch.
 Only a little earth crumbled
from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs.
 Rostov was happy in the
assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false.
 He
was happy to be seeing him.
.
.


Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms.

The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few
steps, and again stopped.
 Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked.
 It flopped into something moist, and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood.
 He did not know
how long his unconsciousness lasted.
 He opened his eyes.


"Have some brought from the reserve," said Napoleon, and having gone on
a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him.


"Ah! He is alive," said Napoleon.

He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other
wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.


The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French
convoy officer, who said rapidly: "We must halt here: the Emperor
will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen
prisoners.


Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.


They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.
 Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was
connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.


"Well, and you, young man," said he.
.
 Looking into
Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
alive could understand or explain.
 Au revoir,
Prince Repnin!" and he spurred his horse and galloped away.


The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but
seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to
return the holy image.


Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the
little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
outside his uniform.
.
 But to whom
should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,
which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
words--the Great All or Nothing-" said he to himself, "or to that God
who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain,
nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and
the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.


"Why, that one, right at the end, the big one.
 There was no one in the hall.
 "Oh God! Is
everyone all right?" he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking
heart, and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the
warped steps of the familiar staircase.
 He looked up at the opening
door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
of delighted amazement.
 "Can it be? My treasure!" and Prokofy, trembling with
excitement, rushed toward the drawing-room door, probably in order to
announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the
young man's shoulder.
 He could not distinguish which was
Papa, which Natasha, and which Petya.
 Everyone shouted, talked, and
kissed him at the same time.
 Nicholas.
.
.
 our own.
.
.
.


"You are most welcome! I know, I know," said the count, kissing and
embracing Denisov.
.
 The servants
were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their
well-brushed clothes.
 "Wostov,
get up!"

Rostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
disheveled head from the hot pillow.


"Why, is it late?"

"Late! It's nearly ten o'clock," answered Natasha's voice.


"Directly!"

Meanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and
forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,
opened the bedroom door.
 Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
her foot into the other.
 Sonya, when he came in, was twirling round and
was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down.
 Natasha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what
they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.


"No, but listen," she said, "now you are quite a man, aren't you? I'm
awfully glad you're my brother.
 Are you the same as we? No?"

"Why did Sonya run away?" asked Rostov.


"Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How are you going to speak to
her--thou or you?"

"As may happen," said Rostov.
 You know Sonya's my dearest friend.
 Such a friend
that I burned my arm for her sake.
"

Natasha suddenly flushed.
.


Rostov became thoughtful.
"

"Well then, that's excellent," said he.
"

"Not seen Duport--the famous dancer? Well then, you won't understand.
"

Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back
a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply
together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.
 Only don't tell anyone.
 "I don't want to marry anyone.
 "And is Denisov nice?"
she asked.
 He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you--Sonya.
 Her looks
asked him to forgive her for having dared, by Natasha's intermediacy, to
remind him of his promise, and then thanked him for his love.


Denisov, to Rostov's surprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded
hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he made
himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies
and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see him.


The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow.
 He knew a lady on one
of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening.


His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow.
 But still, as
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke
about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he
had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared
the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of
as the "angel incarnate.
 He went to balls and into ladies'
society with an affectation of doing so against his will.


The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving
orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist, the Club's head
cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish
for this dinner.
.
 the mayonnaise, that's one," said he,
bending down a finger.


"Then am I to order those large sterlets?" asked the steward.


"Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take less.
 I must have two hundred pots here
on Friday.
 He's not there himself, so you'll have to go in and ask the
princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay--the coachman Ipatka
knows--and look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who danced at Count
Orlov's, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to
me.
"

At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,
preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna
Mikhaylovna entered the hall.

He has forwarded me a letter from Boris.
 I'll put his name down.
 How little we dreamed of such a thing when we
were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young
Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what
consolation I can.
"

"Wh-what is the matter?" asked both the young and old Rostov.
 Pierre took him up, invited him to
his house in Petersburg, and now.
.
.
 she has come here and that daredevil
after her!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for
Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her
sympathy for the "daredevil," as she called Dolokhov.
 At that time, the Russians were so used to victories
that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,
while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
event.
 The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to
discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent.
 The soldiers,
officers, and generals were heroes.

What also conduced to Bagration's being selected as Moscow's hero was
the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger
there.

Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,
stood at every door anxiously noting visitors' every movement in order
to offer their services.
 Most of those present were elderly, respected
men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures
and voices.
 This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups.
 Pierre, who at his
wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, went
about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull.
 The largest circles formed round
Count Rostopchin, Valuev, and Naryshkin.
 The
old count came up to them and pressed Dolokhov's hand.
.
.
 Ah, Vasili Ignatovich.
.
.
 How d'ye do,
old fellow?" he said, turning to an old man who was passing, but before
he had finished his greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who
had run in announced, with a frightened face: "He's arrived!"

Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and--like rye shaken together
in a shovel--the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
ballroom.
 He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip
over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle
of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign
Orders, and the Star of St.
 George on his left breast.
 Evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,
which changed his appearance for the worse.
 Feeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver
with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who
had presented it to him.

   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,
   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!
   E'en fortunate Napoleon
   Knows by experience, now, Bagration,
   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble.
.
.
.
 He was seated in the place of honor between two
Alexanders--Bekleshev and Naryshkin--which was a significant allusion to
the name of the sovereign.


Just before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to Bagration,
who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,
as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ilya looked joyfully
and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son.
 Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of the committee sat
facing Bagration and, as the very personification of Moscow hospitality,
did the honors to the prince.
" All rose
and cried "Hurrah!" Bagration also rose and shouted "Hurrah!" in exactly
the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon Grabern.

Young Rostov's ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred
others.
 When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the
broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had
made and exchanging remarks.



As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed
and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, more glass was
smashed, and the shouting grew louder.
 He was silent all through
dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and
a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his
nose.
 He seemed to see and hear
nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
depressing and unsolved problem.
 Availing himself
of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, Dolokhov
had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him
money.
 It would be
particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just
because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped
him.
 Rostov looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre
appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a
beauty, and in a word--an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his
preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had
not responded to his greeting.


"What are you about?" shouted Rostov, looking at him in an ecstasy of
exasperation.


"Why, I didn't recognize you!" he said.
 But Rostov was otherwise
engaged; he was shouting "Hurrah!"

"Why don't you renew the acquaintance?" said Dolokhov to Rostov.


"Confound him, he's a fool!" said Rostov.


"Don't! Don't! What are you about?" whispered their frightened voices.


Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that
smile of his which seemed to say, "Ah! This is what I like!"

"You shan't have it!" he said distinctly.


"You.
 Despite Denisov's request
that he would take no part in the matter, Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov's
second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with
Nesvitski, Bezukhov's second.
 Pierre went home, but Rostov with Dolokhov
and Denisov stayed on at the Club till late, listening to the gypsies
and other singers.
 'Everyone fears a bear,' he says, 'but when you see one your fear's
all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!' And that's
how it is with me.
 A demain, mon cher.
" *


    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
 He looked about distractedly and screwed
up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun.

"It's even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel,
this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head,
or elbow, or knee.
.
 "You know, Count, it is much more
honorable to admit one's mistake than to let matters become irreparable.
 Allow me to convey.
.
.
.


"No apologies, none whatever," said Dolokhov to Denisov (who on his
side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to the
appointed place.


Denisov first went to the barrier and announced: "As the adve'sawies
have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed.
" And
after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank
on the snow beside it.
 His frowning face was pallid and
quivered.
.
.
" he repeated, puckering his face.
 But on entering Moscow he
suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostov, who
was sitting beside him, by the hand.


"Well? How do you feel?" he asked.
.


Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
learned that Dolokhov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate
of sons and brothers.


He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
had happened to him, but could not do so.
 "I have killed her lover, yes,
killed my wife's lover.
 Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do
it?"--"Because you married her," answered an inner voice.
" And he vividly recalled that moment
after supper at Prince Vasili's, when he spoke those words he had found
so difficult to utter: "I love you.
 "I felt then that it was not so, that I had no
right to do it.
"

He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.


"Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
naked shoulders.
 She laughed contemptuously and said she
was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to
have any children by me.
.
.
.
.
 what?
A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that's nonsense," he
thought.



"Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
criminal," came into Pierre's head, "and from their point of view they
were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr's
death for his sake.
 He
resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
intention to part from her forever.


"The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home,"
said the valet.


But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess
herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was
a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow.
 But feeling this to be senseless
and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her.
"

Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but
could not reply.


"If you won't answer, I'll tell you.
.
"

"Don't speak to me.
 The
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated.
"

After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his
study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he
was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though
he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.


"Father! Andrew!"--said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an
indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.
"

"Scoundrels! Blackguards!" shrieked the old man, turning his face away
from her.
 "Did he believe?
Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms
of eternal peace and blessedness?" she thought.
 I
will follow.
.
 into herself.
.


"Mary," she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back,
"give me your hand.


"There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange.
 only I feel sad.
 Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was
always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
expression and went out again without saying a word.
"

"So there's nothing?"

"Nothing," answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes
at her sister-in-law.
 He tried not
to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him.
 She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
of his return.






CHAPTER VIII


"Dearest," said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of
the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit, but
as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and even
every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so now
the smile of the little princess--influenced by the general mood though
without knowing its cause--was such as to remind one still more of the
general sorrow.
)

"Oh yes," assented Princess Mary, "perhaps that's it.
 The men servants were carrying the
large leather sofa from Prince Andrew's study into the bedroom.
 Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse, Praskovya Savishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the old
prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round
her head.


There was no laughter in the maids' large hall.


Tikhon went and told the prince.
 "I must go and meet him, he
does not know Russian.
 On
a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft.
 He came up the stairs and
embraced his sister.
 "I love you all and have done
no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!" her look seemed to
say.


"My darling!" he said--a word he had never used to her before.
.


"I expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!" said
her eyes.
 She was not surprised at his having come; she did not realize
that he had come.
 They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke
off at every moment.
 A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw Prince Andrew.


"You can't come in! You can't!" said a terrified voice from within.
 Then suddenly a terrible shriek--it could not be hers, she
could not scream like that--came from the bedroom.
 The door opened.
 A woman rushed out and
seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold.



Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father's
room.
 "Ah,
what have you done to me?" it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew
felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin
he could neither remedy nor forget.






CHAPTER X


Rostov's share in Dolokhov's duel with Bezukhov was hushed up by the
efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
Moscow.


"I know people consider me a bad man!" he said.
 The first half of the
winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, was one of the
happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family.
 with this one everything is
calculated, and I don't like that.
 Dolokhov, who did not usually care
for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the
question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon
settled.
 He came because of Sonya.


Dolokhov often dined at the Rostovs', never missed a performance at
which they were present, and went to Iogel's balls for young people
which the Rostovs always attended.


In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before.
 For the Rostov family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of
remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Denisov's
furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment.
 His
approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather
gave zest to his pleasures.
 As soon as he entered he noticed and
felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a
curious embarrassment among some of those present.


"Nicholas, will you come to Iogel's? Please do!" said Natasha.



"Where would I not go at the countess' command!" said Denisov, who at
the Rostovs' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha's knight.
 "But I promised the Arkharovs; they
have a party.
 He called Natasha and asked her what was the matter.
 "I told
you, but you would not believe it," she said triumphantly.
.
 He tried to say,
"That's capital; of course she'll forget her childish promises and
accept the offer," but before he had time to say it Natasha began again.


"Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won't change
once she has said.
"

"And Mamma pressed her!" said Nicholas reproachfully.
"

"Now you don't know that at all!" said Nicholas.
 "But I must talk to
her.
 What a darling Sonya is!" he added with a smile.


"Sophie," he began, timidly at first and then more and more boldly,
"if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous
match but a splendid, noble fellow.
.
.


"Nicholas, don't tell me that!" she said.


"No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in
love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,
confidence, and love as I have for you.
 Then I am young.
 They
were both particularly happy and gay.


Natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
ball was even happier.


Natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom.
 Whatever
person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.


"And how she dances! What gwace!" he said again after a pause.
"

Knowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly
way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Natasha:

"Go and choose Denisov.


"Now then, Vaska," said Nicholas.


"Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!" said Denisov, and he
unhooked his saber.
 He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his
partner's hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,
waiting for the beat.
 At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at
his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one
foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking
his partner with him.


Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone
was delighted with Denisov's skill, he was asked again and again as a
partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the
good old days.






CHAPTER XIII


For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own or at
Dolokhov's home: on the third day he received a note from him:


As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper
tonight to my friends--come to the English Hotel.



About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the
theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov.
 I'll just
finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus.
"

"I called once or twice at your house," said Rostov, reddening.


Rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with Dolokhov.
"

"To try his luck or the certainty?" Rostov asked himself.
 Or are you afraid of me?" he asked again.


"So you are not afraid to play with me?" repeated Dolokhov, and as if
about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his
chair, and began deliberately with a smile:

"Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going about Moscow that
I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.


"Still, don't ruin yourself!" said Dolokhov with a side glance at Rostov
as he continued to deal.
 Instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely
supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand.
 winning it back's
impossible.
.
 Oh, how pleasant it was at home!.
.
 it can't be!.
.
 He can't want my ruin.
.
 Have I killed anyone,
or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune?
And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with
the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma's
name day and then going home.
 No, it can't be! Surely it will all end in
nothing!"

He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.


"Supper, it's time for supper! And here are the gypsies!"

Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
and saying something in their gypsy accents.
.
.
 The ten fell to him.
"

"Oh, it's terrible to feel oneself so in this man's power," thought
Rostov.
 He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother
by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape
it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this
shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a
mouse.


"My cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary to mention
her!" he exclaimed fiercely.


At home, they had not yet gone to bed.
 "Another verse," she said,
without noticing Nicholas.
 "It's no good making excuses
now! It's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla--I entweat you!"

The countess glanced at her silent son.
 Natasha was preparing to sing.
 Denisov was looking
at her with enraptured eyes.
 "No, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by
sympathy with anyone's sorrow," she felt, and she said to herself: "No,
I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am.


"And what is she so pleased about?" thought Nicholas, looking at his
sister.


Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,
mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing.
.
 One, two, three.
.
 Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How
will she take that si? She's taken it! Thank God!" And without noticing
that he was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third
below the high note.
.
 The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son's
condition.
 And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed
of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the
carriage to drive to town:

"Papa, I have come on a matter of business.
.
.
.
"

"Well then, tell him so.


"No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say.
 "You should have
seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out
accidently.
"

"Well, all the same, you must refuse him.
.
.
 In that case you would not have obliged
me to give this refusal.
 She began to
sob aloud.
" He looked at the countess, and seeing
her severe face said: "Well, good-by, Countess," and kissing her
hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without looking at
Natasha.



Next day Rostov saw Denisov off.
 All Denisov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment
at the gypsies', with the result that he had no recollection of how he
was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.


He filled the girls' albums with verses and music, and having at last
sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his
receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of
his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.
 Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg
earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this station,
but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of
indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest
of his life.
 Without changing
his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable
to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without
having solved the problems that so absorbed him.
 He had been engrossed
by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokolniki after
the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night.
 But now,
in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with special force.


The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency
have the courier horses.
 Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey
to evil and death?--death which ends all and must come today or
tomorrow--at any rate, in an instant as compared with eternity.
 He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld.
 Nothing has been found
out, nothing discovered," Pierre again said to himself.
 He
felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his
eyes.

This active old servant was unpacking the traveler's canteen and
preparing tea.
 He brought in a boiling samovar.






CHAPTER II


"I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if I am not
mistaken," said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.

Where are you traveling from?"

The stranger's face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but
in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
irresistibly attractive to Pierre.
"

"I know your outlook," said the Mason, "and the view of life you
mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,
is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit
of pride, indolence, and ignorance.
 Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I
had not known it I should not have addressed you.
"

"Just as I may suppose you to be deluded," said Pierre, with a faint
smile.

"No one can attain to truth by himself.
 You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.
"

"Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Pierre.
 You do not
know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in thee,
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!" pronounced
the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.


He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.


Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.
.
 The
highest wisdom has but one science--the science of the whole--the
science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it.
 To receive
that science it is necessary to purify and renew one's inner self, and
so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one's
self.
 What hast thou attained
relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you
are clever, you are well educated.
 You have become
the possessor of wealth.
 A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not know
God and hate your life.


"How about the horses?" he asked, without looking at Pierre.
"

"Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
all, and without promising to help me?" thought Pierre, rising with
downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at
the Mason.
 With my whole soul I wish to be what you
would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.
 Help me, teach me, and
perhaps I may.


"Help comes from God alone," he said, "but such measure of help as
our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir.
"

The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw from the
postmaster's book.
 It seemed to him that he had been vicious
only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous.
 Not
a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul.
 He firmly believed
in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim
of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how
Freemasonry presented itself to him.
 A week after his arrival, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom
Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came into his room
one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which Dolokhov's
second had called on him, and, having closed the door behind him and
satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room, addressed
Pierre.
 Do you wish to enter the
Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?"

The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met
at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,
surprised Pierre.


"Yes, I do wish it," said he.
 From there they passed into another room.
" (Pierre nodded
affirmatively.
 His arms felt numb, his legs almost gave
way, it seemed to him that he was tired out.
 He felt afraid of what would happen to him and
still more afraid of showing his fear.

The room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside
something white.
 The book was the Gospel, and the
white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and
teeth.
 Hoping to enter on
an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected everything
to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing.
 A skull, a
coffin, the Gospel--it seemed to him that he had expected all this and
even more.
 The door opened and
someone came in.


This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
below.
.
.
.
.
.
 help.


The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,
and began to speak.


"Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order," he said, "and
if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with
profit.
.


"By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve
the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety
and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
sways the world.

He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he
addressed an edifying exhortation to them.
 Of the three
objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,
especially appealed to Pierre.
  4.

5.
 Courage.


"In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death," the
Rhetor said, "to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but
as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and
peace.
"

"Yes, that must be so," thought Pierre, when after these words the
Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation.
 (He now
felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
to those who knew the indubitable truth.


"I am ready for everything," said Pierre.
"

"But I have nothing here," replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked
to give up all he possessed.
.
 Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
a slipper for his left foot.


"And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief
passion," said the latter.


"Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?" He
went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give
the pre-eminence.
.






CHAPTER IV


Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not
the Rhetor but Pierre's sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his
voice.
 Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,
and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the
universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
dangers.
 During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of
now as the "Seeker," now as the "Sufferer," and now as the "Postulant,"
to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords.
 As he
was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty
among his conductors.
 He heard those around him disputing in whispers
and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet.
 Then the candles
were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage
was again removed and more than ten voices said together: "Sic transit
gloria mundi.


Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind.
 "Where am I? What am
I doing? Aren't they laughing at me? Shan't I be ashamed to remember
this?" But these doubts only lasted a moment.
 When
he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather
apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel
and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him.
 He
told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained
trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,
and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor.
 As to the
first pair of gloves, a man's, he said that Pierre could not know their
meaning but must keep them.
 The second pair of man's gloves he was
to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of women's
gloves, he said: "Dear brother, these woman's gloves are intended for
you too.


This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the
rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a
trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and
so on.
 They were very long, and
Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to
understand what was being read.
 He managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind.
 All the Masons sat down in
their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
humility.


The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had
become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits
and way of life.
 Pierre proposed going to his
estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs.
 He
was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vasili suddenly entered
the room.
 "I know all about it, and I can tell you
positively that Helene is as innocent before you as Christ was before
the Jews.
"

But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech, Pierre,
without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his
father, muttered in a whisper:

"Prince, I did not ask you here.
 Go, please go!" And he jumped up and
opened the door for him.


"What's the matter with you? Are you ill?"

"Go!" the quivering voice repeated.
 His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.
 Pierre
who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an
illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match
in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
marriage--when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
to hope from him--especially as he did not know how, and did not wish,
to court society's favor.
 This expression suggested that she
had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband
was a cross laid upon her by God.
 Prince Vasili expressed his opinion
more openly.
 He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and,
pointing to his forehead, remarked:

"A bit touched--I always said so.


Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon's
destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the surrender
of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops
had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was
beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of her soirees.
 We shall not cease
to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the
King of Prussia and others: 'So much the worse for you.


"Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, M.
 Shitov--a man of
great merit"--this of the man usually so described.
 He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to
be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many
pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform.


"The doubt is flattering," said "the man of profound intellect," with a
subtle smile.


Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna very naturally asked
Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he
found the Prussian army.
 For some time he engrossed the general
attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was
received with pleasure by all her visitors.
"

Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation
with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her
aunt wished to hear him.
" and
again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no
more.
 I only wished to say.
.
" (he wanted to repeat a joke
he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to
get in) "I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de
Prusse!"

Boris smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or
appreciative according to the way the joke was received.
 Everybody
laughed.

Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!" she said.


The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
political news.
.
"

When everybody rose to go, Helene who had spoken very little all
the evening again turned to Boris, asking him in a tone of caressing
significant command to come to her on Tuesday.
 She
seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
Tuesday.
.
 Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went
to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his
grandfather called him).


"What is it?" he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally,
he poured too many drops into the glass.
.
.


"Perhaps we'd really better not wake him," he said hesitating.
 Worn out by sleeplessness
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
reproached and disputed with each other.
 Wait, for heaven's sake.


Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him.
 The child screamed
hoarsely.


He still had all the letters in his hand.
 In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and
the rewards sent to the army are innumerable.
 Gallop off to him at once and say I'll have his head
off if everything is not here in a week.
 It was
a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin.


Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.
 'The enemy of the human race,' as you know, attacks the
Prussians.
 The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed
us three times in three years.
.
, Prince V.
 I myself will remain in
hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover.
 There are
thousands such as I in Russia.
 Those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining.
 He does so.
 So
energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at
the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden.
 General Buxhowden was all but
attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him.
 Buxhowden, catches us and attacks.

The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with
sick, and famine is everywhere.
 Twice the marauders even attack our
headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to
disperse them.
 When he
had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away.
 It was
not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him.
 He was not dead,
but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent.
 He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant's face
listened to his regular breathing.
 She pressed it.
"

The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead
against the pillow.


"Yes, this is the one thing left me now," he said with a sigh.
 He told them that steps
would be taken immediately to free his serfs--and that till then they
were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies
were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,
punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,
asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates.
 So the first
task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
inclination--practical business.


He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward.


Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two--morality and the love
of death.


In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg.


What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and
Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St.
 And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his
estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his "brother-instructor"
as he called the Grand Master.
 This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
for these simple, kindly people.






CHAPTER XI


Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state
of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
friend Bolkonski, whom he had not seen for two years.
 Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond.
 He
was struck by the change in him.
 Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more
manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used
to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
concentration on some one thought.
 I hardly
know myself again.


"Well, and you? What are your plans?"

"Plans!" repeated Prince Andrew ironically.
 "Well, you see, I'm building.
.


"No, I meant to ask.
.
 Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre's story of what he had
been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not
only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling
him.
 But you know
it is all over, and forever.
 "Nothing's forever.


"Why so?" asked Prince Andrew.
 "It is not given to man to know
what is right and what is wrong.
 And only now when I am living, or at least trying"
(Pierre's modesty made him correct himself) "to live for others, only
now have I understood all the happiness of life.
 I experienced just the reverse.
 "The others, one's neighbors, le prochain, as you and
Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil.
 But what's
right and what's good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by
us.
 Well, you want an argument," he added, "come on then.
"

They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
as a veranda.
 He has a fit,
he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up.
 It
would be far easier and simpler for him to die.
 And he does not want that.
 His
glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.
.
"

"Why not wash? That is not cleanly," said Prince Andrew; "on the
contrary one must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible.
"

He paused a little while.
 You may not have
seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of
unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and
harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more
and more miserable.






CHAPTER XII


In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
Bald Hills.
"

And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
Andrew.
 He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,
and love.
 But make our
fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up
to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I
have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
which is hidden in heaven," said Pierre.


"Well, what do you think about it?" Pierre asked.
 It's all very well.
.
 But who are we?
Men.


"Do you believe in a future life?" he asked.
 On earth, here on this earth" (Pierre pointed to the
fields), "there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the universe,
in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who are now
the children of earth are--eternally--children of the whole universe.
 I feel that beyond me and above me
there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth.
"

"Yes, that is Herder's theory," said Prince Andrew, "but it is not that
which can convince me, dear friend--life and death are what convince.
.
 And I believe there is.
.
.


"If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man's
highest happiness consists in striving to attain them.
 The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
current beat softly against it below.






CHAPTER XIII


It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at Bald Hills.
 This is the one matter in which she disobeys him.


Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept
in perfect order and readiness for him in his father's house; he himself
went to the nursery.
' It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you will see
her 'God's folk.
 In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon
stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk's
cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar.
 Near them, in an
armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on
her childlike face.


"Andrew, why didn't you warn me?" said the princess, with mild reproach,
as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens.
 Je suis tres contente de vous voir," * she said
to Pierre as he kissed her hand.
 She had known him as a child, and now
his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all
his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him.
" After exchanging the first
greetings, they sat down.
 I am very glad to see you.


"Andrew, au nom de Dieu!" *(2) Princess Mary repeated.


"Mais, ma bonne amie," said Prince Andrew, "vous devriez au contraire
m'etre reconnaissante de ce que j'explique a Pierre votre intimite avec
ce jeune homme.
 And now I'm from Kolyazin, master, where a great
and wonderful blessing has been revealed.
"

"And was Ivanushka with you?"

"I go by myself, benefactor," said Ivanushka, trying to speak in a bass
voice.
"

Pelageya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what
she had seen.


"In Kolyazin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.
.
"

"But, dear me, that must be a fraud!" said Pierre, naively, who had
listened attentively to the pilgrim.
 And
he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him
and said, 'Believe in me and I will make you whole.
"


    * "Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.
"


Pelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's face there was such a look
of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and
now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.
 "I'd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another.
 And
I am also very much afraid for him spiritually.
 Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but that
is the effect of your visit--he is not often like that.
 Pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars.
 And during the two days of the young man's visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.

The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as
his parents' house.


When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone
out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests
of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of
moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own
place, as he had felt under the parental roof.
 Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple.
 And the rest was no concern of
his.


Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
rest.
 He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
parents.


The Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had
served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in
Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
campaign.
 It had been neither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,
when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,
was attached to Platov's division.


Platov's division was acting independently of the main army.
 As no transports could
arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,
searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.

When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called
"Mashka's sweet root.

The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because
nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague
feeling that in the main it was going badly.
 They were half clad, hungry, too weak
to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance.
.
 The trench itself was the room,
in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,
lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table.
 The roof
was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.
 One morning, between seven and
eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed
his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,
then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,
his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head.
 He was
pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Denisov, who
had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.


"I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff!" Denisov was
shouting.
"

"So they are!" said the officers.


"I warn you, Captain," one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently
very angry, was saying.
 "I shall answer for it and not you, and you'd better not buzz
about here till you get hurt.
 "If you are determined to rob, I'll.
"

"Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're safe and sound!" and Denisov
turned his horse on the officer.
"

From the regimental commander's, Denisov rode straight to the staff with
a sincere desire to act on this advice.
 In the evening he came back to
his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in.
 oh! Some more water.
.
.
.
.
 I enter, and at
the table.
.
.
.
 "You've set
your arm bleeding afresh.
 The adjutant
told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a
court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with
which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to
the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.
 Every day, letters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov was ordered to
hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office.
 Perhaps at
another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
at the staff and went into hospital.


The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
that had been pulled to pieces.
 Several bandaged soldiers, with pale
swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
yard.
"

The assistant asked some further questions.
.
 When a new one comes he is done for in a week,"
said the doctor with evident satisfaction.
"

Rostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars, who
was wounded.


"I don't know.


The assistant looked fagged out.
"

"Dead, I fancy.


The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor's words.
 We had a list.
 Have you
got it, Makeev?"

"Makar Alexeevich has the list," answered the assistant.


In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,
the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and
leaving a passage in the middle.
 Rostov went to the middle of the room and looking
through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing
there.
 He stood still, looking silently around.
 He had not at all
expected such a sight.
 Just before him, almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair.
 The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs
outstretched.
 It was "drink, drink,
a drink!" Rostov glanced round, looking for someone who would put this
man back in his place and bring him water.


"No, it's impossible to do anything here," thought Rostov, lowering his
eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed
on him on his right, and he turned.
 The man's neighbor
on one side whispered something to him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed
that the old man wanted to speak to him.
 He drew nearer and saw that the
old man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated
above the knee.


"Ah, Wostov? How are you, how are you?" he called out, still in the
same voice as in the regiment, but Rostov noticed sadly that under this
habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed
itself in the expression of Denisov's face and the intonations of his
voice.
 Only the man who had the next
bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and
smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Tushin still listened, shaking his
head disapprovingly.


"The auditor wrote out a petition for you," continued Tushin, "and
you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it.


Late in the evening, when Rostov was about to leave, he asked Denisov
whether he had no commission for him.


"It seems it's no use knocking one's head against a wall!" he said,
coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope.


On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
Tilsit.


"I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon," he replied.
 The
general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.


"You will go far," he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
 Since he had begun to move in the
highest circles Boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all
that went on around him and to note it down.
 As the Emperor's suite was
a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who
valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of
this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,
Boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured.


Boris lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilinski.
 That same day, Rostov, profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging
occupied by Boris and Zhilinski.
 Quite lately, happening
to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, Rostov had maintained with
heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the
criminal Bonaparte.


Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov.


"No, I came on business," replied Rostov, briefly.


Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
dissatisfaction on Boris' face, and as always happens to those in a bad
humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and
that he was in everybody's way.


"Anyhow, I'm in your way," he said in a low tone.
 "But if you are tired, come and lie
down in my room and have a rest.
 Rostov, without
sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Boris were to blame
in some way) telling him about Denisov's affair, asking him whether,
through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on
Denisov's behalf and get Denisov's petition handed in.


Boris smiled.
.
"

At that moment Zhilinski's voice was heard calling Boris.


"Well then, go, go, go.
.
.
" said Rostov, and refusing supper and
remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long
time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.
 On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were
signed.
 In a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors
draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N.
 In
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.


"Boris doesn't want to help me and I don't want to ask him.
 He understands everything, knows everything.
.
 It's all nonsense! I'll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor
myself so much the worse for Drubetskoy who drives me to it!" And
suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect, Rostov felt for
the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house.


"A good figure and in her first bloom," he was saying, but on seeing
Rostov, he stopped short and frowned.
.


"Whom have you come from? Who are you?"

"I come from Major Denisov," answered Rostov.
"

"What audacity! Hand it in through your commander.


Rostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,
jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice
told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Denisov, whom the
general knew.
 Having heard Rostov to the end, the general shook his head
gravely.


The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.






CHAPTER XXI


The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion
of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.
 It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter
to him.


"Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
bravest of your soldiers," said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
every letter.
"

The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,
remarked:

"But we must give him an answer.
"

Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov in his
scrutiny.
 But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid
position.


Lazarev sat in the place of honor.
 Crowds of officers and
civilians drew near merely to see him.

Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by
Rostov.
' One day our Emperor gives it
and next day Napoleon.
 Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St.
 George's
Cross to the bravest of the French Guards.
.
 He caught himself
harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.
 They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would
have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.
 If we're punished, it
means that we have deserved it, it's not for us to judge.
.
" said he.


Life meanwhile--real life, with its essential interests of health and
sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,
science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions--went on
as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.


He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.
 A trained midwife was engaged for Bogucharovo
at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
the children of the peasants and household serfs.

Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed
to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received many books,
and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors
from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged behind
himself--who never left the country--in knowledge of what was happening
in home and foreign affairs.


Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new
grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white
spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky.
 He was not thinking of
anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.
 The birches with their sticky green
leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades
of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year's leaves.


Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.
.
 How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are
coming out.
.
 Only the
dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
the sunshine.
 Under the oak,
too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,
misshapen, and grim as ever.
 He was glad to see Prince
Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying
the night.
 He was cross with the
stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he
was vexed with himself for having stayed.


His room was on the first floor.


"But when are you coming to bed?" replied another voice.
 She was evidently leaning right out, for the rustle of her
dress and even her breathing could be heard.
 From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.






CHAPTER III


Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not
waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
 Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only
a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road
and the sappy leaves.
 Neither gnarled fingers nor
old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now.


"I know myself that one cannot help one's sympathies and antipathies,"
thought Prince Andrew, "so it will not do to present my proposal for
the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally, but the
project will speak for itself.


During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the
anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms
were well known to him.
 One general (an important personage), evidently
feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing
his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
 Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard
from the other side of the door, and the officer--with pale face and
trembling lips--came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching
his head.
"

"You see, my dear sir, I have read your project," interrupted Arakcheev,
uttering only the first words amiably and then--again without looking
at Prince Andrew--relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt.

"You are proposing new military laws? There are many laws but no one to
carry out the old ones.
"

"I came at His Majesty the Emperor's wish to learn from your excellency
how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented," said
Prince Andrew politely.


"I don't want one.
 I'll speak to him.
.
 Just the same as now--I ask you, Count--who will be heads of
the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?"

"Those who pass the examinations, I suppose," replied Kochubey, crossing
his legs and glancing round.
.
"

Count Kochubey did not finish.
 He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,
and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open
forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was
just entering.
 In the society in which
Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward
and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he
had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those
half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed
nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all
he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands--hands which
were broad, but very plump, soft, and white.
 He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.


Prince Andrew followed Speranski's every word and movement with
particular attention.
 He did not say that the Emperor
had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.


Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given
Bolkonski.
" He paused
at the full stop.
 "I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to
co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.


"I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me," he said
with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he
and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
he had just been talking.
 This flattered Prince Andrew.
 "I have known of
you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs,
a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more
imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the
chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree
concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much
gossip and tittle-tattle.
 I began the service from the lower grade.
 Certain rights and privileges for the
     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that
     sentiment.


"Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue," * he began,
pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower
than in Russian but quite calmly.
 "Every courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.
"

"Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince," said
Speranski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an
argument which was embarrassing for his companion.
 "If you will do
me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday," he added, "I will, after
talking with Magnitski, let you know what may interest you, and shall
also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.






CHAPTER VI


During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the
whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.
 The mechanism
of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,
absorbed the greater part of his vital energy.
 In Prince Andrew's eyes Speranski was the man
he would himself have wished to be--one who explained all the facts of
life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and was
capable of applying the standard of reason to everything.
 This was Speranski's cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow
one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince
Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who
possess power.
 He
made use of every kind of mental device, except analogy, and passed too
boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one to another.


In general the trait of Speranski's mentality which struck Prince Andrew
most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority
of reason.
 It was evident that the thought could never occur to him
which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is after all
impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never felt the
doubt, "Is not all I think and believe nonsense?" And it was just this
peculiarity of Speranski's mind that particularly attracted Prince
Andrew.

A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
Regulations and--what he had not at all expected--was chairman of a
section of the committee for the revision of the laws.
 or Ivan Vasilevich D.


He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories.
 In the first he
put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of
God, the three primordial elements--sulphur, mercury, and salt--or
the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
Solomon.


In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,
seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight
and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.
 These according to Pierre's
observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for
anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,
and of whom there were very many in the lodge.


In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg.
 What is
to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow
everything, repel force by force?.

Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy
evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no
violence.


"The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing
men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction--aiming
at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue:
raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood.
 In a word, we must found a form of government holding
universal sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without
destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other
governments can continue in their customary course and do everything
except what impedes the great aim of our order, which is to obtain for
virtue the victory over vice.
"

This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in
the lodge.
 It was long since there had been so stormy a
meeting.
 He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed
on which he lay.

I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed
to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of
my rupture with the Brothers.

Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.
 My mother-in-law came to me in tears and
said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her; that she
was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more.
 I knew that if
I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing
what she wanted.
 It gave me joy to tell her this.
 "There has never been
an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
heart"--a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source, he
believed implicitly.
 But
a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
all this time in Pierre's soul, revealing much to him and causing him
many spiritual doubts and joys.
 visited me and we had a preliminary
talk about the reception of a new Brother.
 was very eloquent.

I nominated him and was the Rhetor.
 A strange feeling agitated me all
the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber.
 I caught myself
harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to
overcome.
 and S.
 were
members of our lodge (a question to which I could not reply) and that
according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our
holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to
desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed
to me insincere, and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark
temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words,
and I wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it.
 Great Architect of Nature, help me to
find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies!


 After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then
the following was written:


I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V.
 Adonai is the name of the creator of the world.
 strengthen, refresh, and
support me in the path of virtue.

The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me.
 Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.
 After dinner I fell asleep and as I was
drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, "Thy day!"

I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
dogs, but I went on undismayed.
 It seemed as if I chattered
incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him.
 And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this.
 But he
looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks.
 I
felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly
found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed.
 He shook his head
incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living
with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband.
"


9th December

I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart.
 I seemed to know at once that
the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed
to meet him.
 And I said, "I should
have known you had I met you by chance," and I thought to myself, "Am I
telling the truth?" And suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then
he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large
book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, "I drew that," and he answered
by bowing his head.
 And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt
that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away from them.


Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,
the way of life at Otradnoe--Mitenka's management of affairs, in
particular--was such that the debts inevitably increased every year.
 The
only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply
for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and
also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.


Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without
themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one.
 In
1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special
lucrative posts in Petersburg.


Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg's merits, it could not be
denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms
with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before
him and an assured position in society.
 But on the contrary, my papa and mamma
are now provided for--I have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic
Provinces--and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with her fortune
and my good management we can get along nicely.
.

Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite
different--an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.
 you know?.
 Unpleasant.
.
.
.
 Well, you
will be coming," he was going to say, "to dine," but changed his mind
and said "to take tea with us," and quickly doubling up his tongue he
blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying his dream
of happiness.
.
 Before Sonya and her mother, if
Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that
episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not worth
mentioning.


Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered.
 He had a brilliant
position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezukhova,
a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an
important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was
beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized.


"How handsome you have grown!"

"I should think so!" replied Natasha's laughing eyes.
 He felt
the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her
occasionally.
 This Natasha noticed at once.
 and S.
 He looked
round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.
 The
same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at
him.
 The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face, but seeing, that Natasha's head was covered, she smiled in
her kind, weak way.


"Now then, now then!" said she.
 "Now, just one on your
throat and another.


"What is it tonight?--But I have to tell you.
.
 I know," she said seriously; "that's what I have come
about.
.
"

As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter.
 Natasha
was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess
only saw her daughter's face in profile.
 That face struck her by its
peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.


"Well, what then?" said she.


"You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You
know you can't marry him.
.


"It won't do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship
dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may
injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all
it torments him for nothing.
"

"Crazy?" repeated Natasha.
.
.
.


Natasha continued: "Don't you really understand? Nicholas would
understand.


"Sonya?" she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little kitten
with her enormous plait of hair.
.
.
.
 prince.


One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and
mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.


A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, who were
to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.


Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and
ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork
silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the
hairdressing was almost done.


"Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?"

"I have only my cap to pin on.


"Mavra, quicker, darling!"

"Give me my thimble, Miss, from there.
 "Here
is some scent.


Sonya slammed the door to.
.


"What a beauty--a very queen!" said the nurse as she came to the door.

"And Sonya! They are lovely!"

At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.
 Her ugly old body was washed,
perfumed, and powdered in just the same way.


In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms--with music, flowers, dances,
the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg.
 And this was the very attitude that
became her best.


"There are some like ourselves and some worse," she thought.
 "How lovely! She
is quite equal to Marya Antonovna.
 See how the men, young and old, pay
court to her.
.
"

She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
daughter.
 "And look,
here come her suitors.
 "Put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!"

Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd
and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he
were passing through a crowd at a fair.
 He had promised to be at the ball and introduce
partners to her.


But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark
man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window
talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon.
 Takes
after his father.
 And he's hand in glove with Speranski, writing some
project or other.
 "I'd
give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.
 Behind him walked
his host and hostess.
 He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left
as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over.
.
 Natasha
felt that she would be left with her mother and Sonya among a minority
of women who crowded near the wall, not having been invited to dance.

She stood with her slender arms hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom
rising and falling regularly, and with bated breath and glittering,
frightened eyes gazed straight before her, evidently prepared for the
height of joy or misery.
 She was not concerned about the Emperor or any
of those great people whom Peronskaya was pointing out--she had but one
thought: "Is it possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among
the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will
notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as
if they were saying, 'Ah, she's not the one I'm after, so it's not worth
looking at her!' No, it's impossible," she thought.
 She and the countess and Sonya were standing by themselves
as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers, with no one
interested in them and not wanted by anyone.
 A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz.
 An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess
Bezukhova and asked her to dance.


Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing
stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the
front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs.


"Where is she?" asked Bolkonski.
 And such was
Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her
mistakes in speaking French.
 In the middle of the
cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natasha, still out of
breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her.

When her partner left her Natasha ran across the room to choose two
ladies for the figure.


When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers.
 Natasha did not answer at
once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: "How can
you ask such a question?"

"I have never enjoyed myself so much before!" she said, and Prince
Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
father and instantly dropped again.


At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
his wife occupied in court circles.


Pierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her.


"How delightful it is, Count!" said she.


"Yes, I am very glad," he said.
.
 There's something fresh, original,
un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.
 He
listened with quiet irony to Bitski's enthusiastic account of it.
 In the parqueted dining room this small
house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a
monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly
gathering of Speranski's intimate acquaintances already assembled at
five o'clock.
 The whole company were standing between two
windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres.
" he went on,
turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story.
 Before Magnitski
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
still funnier.
 Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state
service, related to people in the service.
 It seemed that in this
company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
ridicule.
 Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its
former lively tone.
 Speranski's high-pitched voice struck
him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
note.


After dinner Speranski's daughter and her governess rose.
 He patted the
little girl with his white hand and kissed her.
 For a few moments all were
silent.
 "A
wonderful talent!" he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnitski immediately
assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which
he had composed about various well-known Petersburg people.
 He was
interrupted several times by applause.
 When the verses were finished
Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his leave.


"I promised to go to a reception.
 Then he vividly pictured to himself
Bogucharovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan;
he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally
applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he
felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
work.
 She and all the Rostov family welcomed him as an old friend,
simply and cordially.
 "Yes," he thought, "they
are capital people, who of course have not the slightest idea what a
treasure they possess in Natasha; but they are kindly folk and form
the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic, charming girl,
overflowing with life!"

In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
already begun to disconcert him.
 He felt happy and at the same time sad.
 Yes and no.
 "Pierre was right
when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order
to be happy, and now I do believe in it.
 Berg arrived in an immaculate
brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.
 Unfortunately she
could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate
with you," he said with a smile.
"

"I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count" (Berg said this with
perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable),
"and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife's
friends.


"But don't be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten minutes to
eight, please.
 We shall make up a rubber.
 He
is very good to me.


Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready
for their guests' arrival.


In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures
and new furniture sat Berg and his wife.
 Berg, closely buttoned up in
his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then
does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.


"You can get to know something, you can ask for something.
 See how I
managed from my first promotion.
) "And how have I
obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances.
 It
goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical.
 We must live for
society.


"This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances," thought Berg.


"It can't be helped: men must sometimes have masculine conversation,"
said he.


They received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where it was
impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,
neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection.
 Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself, and Berg and Vera immediately began their evening
party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
guest.


Vera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained
with conversation about the French embassy, at once began accordingly.
 Though the
conversation was very incoherent and Vera was angry at the intrusion
of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with satisfaction
that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had begun very
well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its
talk, tea, and lighted candles.
 The old people sat with the
old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the Panins had at their party.
 She, having raised her head, was looking up
at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing.
 Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they
were talking secrets, sat down beside them.
 What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her
attachments? Could she, like other women" (Vera meant herself), "love a
man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider
true love.
 Now you know, Count,"
she said to Pierre, "even our dear cousin Boris, who, between ourselves,
was very far gone in the land of tenderness.
"

"I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?"

"Oh, there was childish love?" suddenly asked Prince Andrew, blushing
unexpectedly.


"Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love.
 Le
cousinage est un dangereux voisinage.






CHAPTER XXII


Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the
Rostovs and spent the rest of the day there.
 She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
not bring himself to do so.
.
 What
does that mean? Does it mean that it's the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are
you asleep?"

"No, my love; I am frightened myself," answered her mother.
 It was as if she feared
this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding
him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.
 Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already
then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.
" said
her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had
written in Natasha's album.
 Since the intimacy of
his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a
gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel
oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity
of all things human came to him oftener than before.


"Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,
but the feeling is stronger than I.
 Yesterday I tormented myself and
suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in
the world, I have not lived till now.
.
.
.
 "Do you
know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.
 I am very glad," said Pierre, and his face really
changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince
Andrew.
 And I am very
happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.
.
 Passing a mirror
she glanced into it.


In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, "At home?" and
then footsteps were heard.
 Natasha was looking at the mirror, but did
not see herself.
 She knew this for certain, though
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.
"

Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with
an agitated and serious face.


"It is long since we had the pleasure.


"I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
father's.


"Go, Natasha! I will call you," said the countess in a whisper.
 He remained silent, looking
into her eyes.
 "Your offer.
 I am glad.
.
"

"I will speak to her when I have your consent.
 Do you give it to me?"
said Prince Andrew.
 She held out her hand to him, and with a
mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand.
.
.
 When she came
in and saw him she paused.
 May I hope?"

He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
her face.
 Then she sighed loudly
and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.
 Something in him had suddenly
changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear
at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
the duty that now bound him to her forever.


"Is it possible that I--the 'chit of a girl,' as everybody called me,"
thought Natasha--"is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the
equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father looks up to?
Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no more playing with
life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies a responsibility for
my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask me?"

"No," she replied, but she had not understood his question.
 I am afraid for you, you do not yet know
yourself.
 I ask you to
make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall remain a
secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should you come
to love.
.
 "But why a year? Why a
year?.
"

Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.
 He said that as he
was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it;
that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but that he did
not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom.
 Sometimes the others would get up and
go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent.
 When Prince Andrew spoke (he
could tell a story very well), Natasha listened to him with pride; when
she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and
scrutinizingly at her.


On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with
him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs' once since the ball.
 He did so.
"

And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his
absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.


"Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him from
childhood.
 He has a heart of gold.
.
 all right, I know I am not to say that.
 Princess Mary had
two passions and consequently two joys--her nephew, little Nicholas, and
religion--and these were the favorite subjects of the prince's attacks
and ridicule.
 Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children.
 The first death I saw,
and one I shall never forget--that of my dear sister-in-law--left that
impression on me.
 Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother's duties.
 As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
there receive a place I dare not hope for myself.
 It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his
political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
of expressing his views regardless of anybody.
 He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late.
 I hope it will cure him.
 He wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was.
 You know me
and my relations with Father.
 I want nothing from him.
 The next day the old prince said to her quietly:

"Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.
.
.
.
 "She'll make a
splendid princess!"

And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary
noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
Frenchwoman.
 She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
idea.
 Princess Mary was particularly fond of her.
.
 An
inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle.
 And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
is the lot of a whole class--the military.


Nicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full when,
after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd regiment, in which he
already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Denisov.
 Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home
more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come
back to gladden and comfort his old parents.
 This letter grieved and mortified
Nicholas.
 For a moment he
hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natasha
before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations
about Sonya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again
put it off.
 The count was so weak, and trusted Mitenka
so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him
and things were going from bad to worse.


This letter touched Nicholas.
 Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested him
extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
Order of St.


During the first half of the journey--from Kremenchug to Kiev--all
Rostov's thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with the
squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his
three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, and to wonder anxiously
how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would find there.
 Thoughts
of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it--far stronger, as
though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of
attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance.


After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
expectation--the feeling that "everything is just the same, so why did I
hurry?"--Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world.
 "I am so tranquil and happy now.
.


Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
 She did not seem at
all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband.
 She was
even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old.
 Once, when he had
touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise
and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too
had doubts about this marriage.
 Don't tell Natasha.
) "He is an excellent man!"





CHAPTER II


After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull.
 The village elder,
a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in the
passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count's voice
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of
abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.


"Robber!.
.
.


Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in
the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff of
the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words, shouting, "Be off! Never let me
see your face here again, you villain!"

Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery.


Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
smile, said to him:

"But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! Mitenka has
told me all about it.
 I.
.
"

"No, Papa.
 "I used to understand what a 'corner'
and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to another page I
don't understand at all," said he to himself, and after that he did not
meddle in business affairs.
 Well, I don't like
Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like Boris, but they were our friends and
poor.
 The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of
August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had
become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye.
 The hounds of that ardent young
sportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
a three days' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on
a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an
undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.


All that day the hounds remained at home.
 He doffed his Circassian cap
to his master and looked at him scornfully.


"Daniel!" Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the weather,
the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that
irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous
resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress.


"I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen," his bass boomed out after a minute's
pause.
 "Come to me with
Uvarka.
 Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was
like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
surroundings of human life.
 "I knew you would! Sonya said you
wouldn't go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn't
help going.
"

"Yes, we are going," replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he
intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natasha and Petya.
"

"You know it is my greatest pleasure," said Natasha.
 Mamma said you mustn't," said Nicholas to Natasha.
 Nicholas,
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles, went past Natasha and Petya who were trying to
tell him something.
 Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,
the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling
hound could be heard.
 In front rode a
fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.


"Good morning, Uncle!" said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.
 I was sure of it," began "Uncle.
) "I knew you wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good
thing you're going.
.
"

"That's where I'm going.
 Shall we join up our packs?" asked Nicholas.


The hounds were joined into one pack, and "Uncle" and Nicholas rode on
side by side.
 Petya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled
at his horse.
 Natasha understood
it.
"

"A good thing too, little countess," said "Uncle," "only mind you don't
fall off your horse," he added, "because--that's it, come on!--you've
nothing to hold on to.
 They all took up their places.

His horses and trap were sent home.

Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed.
 Before the hunt, by old custom, the
count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken a snack, and
washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.


The thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having got everything ready, kept
glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
chat.
 He was the buffoon, who went by a woman's name,
Nastasya Ivanovna.


"Well, Nastasya Ivanovna!" whispered the count, winking at him.
 "Have you seen the
young countess?" he asked.
 "Where is she?"

"With young Count Peter, by the Zharov rank grass," answered Simon,
smiling.

"She's as good as many a man!"

"Of course! It's marvelous.
 "They are on the scent of the cubs.
.
 After the cry of the hounds
came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel's hunting horn; the
pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,
with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after
a wolf.
 The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the
cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel's voice, now a deep
bass, now piercingly shrill.
 The count started and dropped the
snuffbox.

The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
horses' feet at the wolf.
 On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.


"Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!.
 When he caught sight of the count
his eyes flashed lightning.
 What sportsmen!" and as if scorning to
say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving
flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
had aroused and flew off after the hounds.






CHAPTER V


Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf.
 By
the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs
whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen
approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the
copse.
 Several times he addressed a prayer to God
that the wolf should come his way.
" Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed rapidly and
clearly through his mind.


Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
the deserted field.
 "No, it can't be!" thought Rostov, taking a deep
breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for.
 She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that
no one saw her.

Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.
 The borzois jumped up,
jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.


"Ulyulyu!" cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own accord
his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to head
off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.
 Nicholas
did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see the
borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who,
increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow.
.
" he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi who
was now his only hope.
 Karay, with all the strength age had left him,
stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily
aside to intercept it.

Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the
wolf would certainly escape should she reach it.
 A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did
not know, from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in
front and almost knocked her over.


Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's path, the old
dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of
it.
 As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Karay, tucked
her tail yet further between her legs, and increased her speed.
 Nicholas was about to stab her, but
Daniel whispered, "Don't! We'll gag her!" and, changing his position,
set his foot on the wolf's neck.
 "A formidable one, eh?" he asked
Daniel, who was standing near.
 The borzois bore down on it.


Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.
 While still at a
distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was
pale and breathless and his face was angry.


Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and Petya to
wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's, Ilagin's, hunting
party was.
 Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised his beaver
cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man
punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else's
borzois.
 Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now
doubled, moved on.


Rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,
red-spotted bitch on Ilagin's leash, slender but with muscles like
steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes.
 "Is she swift?"

"That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's after," answered
Ilagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year
before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs.


"Yes, she's fast enough," replied Nicholas, and thought: "If only a
full-grown hare would cross the field now I'd show you what sort of
borzoi she is," and turning to his groom, he said he would give a ruble
to anyone who found a hare.
 what could be better?" (he again
raised his cap to Natasha) "but as for counting skins and what one
takes, I don't care about that.
.
)

"Ah, he has found one, I think," said Ilagin carelessly.
 "Rugayushka!" he added, involuntarily by
this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this
red borzoi.
 Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and
her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by it.


"How is it pointing?" asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward the
whip who had sighted the hare.
 The pack on leash rushed
downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare.
 The tranquil Ilagin, Nicholas, Natasha,
and "Uncle" flew, reckless of where and how they went, seeing only the
borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant
of the chase.
 He
took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him,
and, finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid
back his ears and rushed off headlong.
 From behind Erza rushed the
broad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the
hare.
 The hare had squatted.
 At the very moment when she would have seized her
prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye
and the stubble.
 There,
it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble
borzois.
 "There are your thousand-ruble ones.
"

"Rugay, here's a pad for you!" he said, throwing down the hare's muddy
pad.
 At the same moment Natasha, without drawing breath, screamed
joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set everyone's ear
tingling.
 The others all followed, dispirited and
shamefaced, and only much later were they able to regain their former
affectation of indifference.
 For a long time they continued to look at
red Rugay who, his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring
of his leash, walked along just behind "Uncle's" horse with the serene
air of a conqueror.
 But when it is, then look out!" his appearance seemed to
Nicholas to be saying.


When, much later, "Uncle" rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him,
he felt flattered that, after what had happened, "Uncle" deigned to
speak to him.
 That's it,
come on!" said "Uncle.
" "You see it's damp weather, and you could rest,
and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.


"Uncle" led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a
folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvorov, of
the host's father and mother, and of himself in military uniform.
 In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which
caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head,
this woman (who was "Uncle's" housekeeper) trod very lightly.
 When she had finished, she stepped aside and
stopped at the door with a smile on her face.
 The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anisya
Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, whiteness, and
pleasant smiles.
 After a casual pause, such as often occurs
when receiving friends for the first time in one's own house, "Uncle,"
answering a thought that was in his visitors' mind, said:

"This, you see, is how I am finishing my days.
 That's
it, come on! Nothing will remain.
 "Why have you shut it?"

The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room, as they
called the room for the hunt servants.
.
.
 I have got him a good balalayka.


"Very good?" said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her brother's tone.
 The balalayka was retuned several times and
the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary
of it and wished to hear it again and again.
 She jumped up and hugged and kissed him.
.



    * The French shawl dance.


"Well, little countess; that's it--come on!" cried "Uncle," with a
joyous laugh, having finished the dance.
 "Well done, niece! Now a fine
young fellow must be found as husband for you.
 "What did Nicholas' smile mean
when he said 'chosen already'? Is he glad of it or not? It is as if he
thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety.
 But
he would understand it all.


"Uncle" played another song and a valse; then after a pause he cleared
his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:

    As 'twas growing dark last night
    Fell the snow so soft and light.
.
.


"Yes," returned Nicholas.


"Got it?" said Nicholas.
 What a good fellow Uncle is! Don't you think so?.
 "And do you know," she suddenly said, "I know that I
shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now.
 There was still the hunting
establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the same fifty horses
and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive presents and
dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there were still the
count's games of whist and boston, at which--spreading out his cards so
that everybody could see them--he let himself be plundered of hundreds
of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to
play a rubber with Count Rostov as a most profitable source of income.
 She invited Nicholas to
come to Moscow.


Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that
now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him
married.


"No, you have not understood me," said his mother, not knowing how to
justify herself.
 "I would
sacrifice anything for you--even my feelings.
"

But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not
want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice
for him.


"No, you have not understood me, don't let us talk about it," she
replied, wiping away her tears.
 I can always
sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare," he said to himself,
"but I can't coerce my feelings.
 Though she blamed herself for it, she could
not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya, often pulling her
up without reason, addressing her stiffly as "my dear," and using the
formal "you" instead of the intimate "thou" in speaking to her.
 The countess was playing patience.
 Natasha came into the room, went up to Sonya, glanced at
what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without
speaking.
 I want him.
.
"

"Sit down with me a little," said the countess.


"Stop playing--there's a time for everything," said the old woman.


"Let her alone, Kondratevna," said Natasha.
"

Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went
to the vestibule.
 They broke off and rose as she entered.


"Oh, Nikita, please go.
.
.
 Yes, go to the yard
and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some oats.
"

"Just a few oats?" said Misha, cheerfully and readily.


Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
 Natasha
liked to test her power over him.


"Oh dear, what a young lady!" said Foka, pretending to frown at Natasha.


"Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?" she asked the
buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket.


Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were
plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds.
.


Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand.
 Natasha glanced at
her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she
remembered the light falling through that crack once before and Sonya
passing with a glass in her hand.


"Oh, you are there!" said Sonya with a start, and came near and
listened.
 I am just finishing the design.
 "Tell him I want him to come and
sing.
 But perhaps he'll come today, will come
immediately.
" She rose, put down
the guitar, and went to the drawing room.
 "Well,
sit down by me.
 "My God, my God!
The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the
same way!" thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the
same.


After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.






CHAPTER X


"Does it ever happen to you," said Natasha to her brother, when they
settled down in the sitting room, "does it ever happen to you to feel
as if there were nothing more to come--nothing; that everything good is
past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?"

"I should think so!" he replied.
 "I have felt like that when everything
was all right and everyone was cheerful.
"

"Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!" Natasha interrupted him.
 We were terribly absurd.
.
 But you see, you remember!"

"Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.


Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared
the same reminiscences.


She only really took part when they recalled Sonya's first arrival.


"They have brought the cock, Miss," she said in a whisper.


In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner.
 He took off its cloth
covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.
.
 "No,
that can't be!"

"Not lower, who said we were lower?.
 How do I know what I was before?"
Natasha rejoined with conviction.
 Sing me something," they heard the
countess say.
.
"

"Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!" said the countess, not
realizing to whom she was speaking.
 Before Natasha had finished singing, fourteen-year-old
Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers had arrived.


Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt--this was Nicholas.
 A Turkish
girl was Petya.
"

"No, why disturb the old fellow?" said the countess.
 Everyone told her she looked very handsome,
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her.
 Some
inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and
in her male attire she seemed quite a different person.
 Louisa Ivanovna
consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,
drove up to the porch.


"You go ahead, Zakhar!" shouted Nicholas to his father's coachman,
wishing for a chance to race past him.


Nicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her face closer.

Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
him from her sable furs--so close and yet so distant--in the moonlight.


"That used to be Sonya," thought he, and looked at her closer and
smiled.


"What is it, Nicholas?"

"Nothing," said he and turned again to the horses.


When they came out onto the beaten highroad--polished by sleigh runners
and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the
moonlight--the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
increased their pace.
 The near side horse, arching his head and breaking
into a short canter, tugged at his traces.
 From that sleigh one could hear the
shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.
 With
screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallop--the other sleighs followed.
 The shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
ready to put on speed when required.
 They were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.


"Where are we?" thought he.
 Zakhar,
while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the reins.
" different
voices were saying.
 The corked
eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed, and
merry faces.


"You wouldn't go, it takes courage.
.
 Everything quite all right, and he began persuading
her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got
frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands.
 It was lucky the maids ran in just then.
"

"Now, why frighten them?" said Pelageya Danilovna.
.
 It depends on what
you hear; hammering and knocking--that's bad; but a sound of shifting
grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.
"

Pelageya Danilovna smiled.


"Oh, I've forgotten.
 It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks
to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her.
 And
really, that evening, Sonya was brighter, more animated, and prettier
than Nicholas had ever seen her before.


"So that's what she is like; what a fool I have been!" he thought gazing
at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile
dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.
 "May I go at once?" She got
up.
 "And what have I been
thinking of till now?"

Sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn.


"I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?" thought Nicholas,
and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and
along the path that led to the back porch.
 This path led to the barn.
 The log walls of the
barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out of some
precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight.
 A tree in the garden snapped
with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent.


From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
the voice of an old maidservant saying, "Straight, straight, along the
path, Miss.
 Only, don't look back.


"Sonya!.
.






CHAPTER XII


When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovna's, Natasha, who always
saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss should
go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sonya with Nicholas and the
maids.
 He
looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new Sonya, and
being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,
inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground
flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in
fairyland.


"Natasha!" he whispered in French, "do you know I have made up my mind
about Sonya?"

"Have you told her?" asked Natasha, suddenly beaming all over with joy.

Natasha--are you glad?"

"I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you.
 I did not
tell you, but you have been treating her badly.
.
.
 "You have done splendidly.
 The same
happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes looking up
from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that Circassian
was Sonya, and that Sonya was certainly his future happy and loving
wife.
.


"Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him," said Sonya.


"I see someone with a mustache," said Natasha, seeing her own face.
 suddenly
Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with
her hand.


"Oh, Natasha!" she cried.


"You saw him?" urged Natasha, seizing her hand.
.
 I.


"Yes, I saw him," she said.
 At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying down.
"

"Andrew lying? Is he ill?" asked Natasha, her frightened eyes fixed on
her friend.
" And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
seen what she described.
.
.
.






CHAPTER XIII


Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love
for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her.
 The countess, who had
long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage.
 On this occasion, he
was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could have
been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and
his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
finances.
.
.
 The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
affairs, which called for some decisive action.
 Their town house and
estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had
to go to Moscow.
 Firmly
convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor,
and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to which he had
devoted himself with such ardor--all the zest of such a life vanished
after the engagement of Andrew and Natasha and the death of Joseph
Alexeevich, the news of which reached him almost at the same time.


In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,
driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Kremlin Square
with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of
the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried
nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old
Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself
at home in a quiet haven.
 As soon as
he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was
surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began.
 The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
there.
 He could not have believed it! Had he not at one
time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;
then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then
a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the
possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful
human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?
Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?

But instead of all that--here he was, the wealthy husband of an
unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government
a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in
Moscow society.
 The Spaniards, through
the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the
French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the
Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June
they defeated the Spaniards.
 My brother Masons swear by the blood that
they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but they
do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor, and they
intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an
authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs, and the meaning
of which the very man who wrote it does not understand.
 We all profess
the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors,
the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty
churches--but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister
of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a
cross to kiss before his execution.


He read, and read everything that came to hand.
 Though the doctors
warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he
drank a great deal.
 Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
not as dreadful as he had thought.
 He was always conscious of some
aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read.


Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.

There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures--talks with
the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills--and she
had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life.
 She did not go
out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her go
anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties.
 She saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house.
 She
had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her.
 Julie, with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met.

Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never.
 Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it
would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this
loving despot--the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
tormented himself and her--knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate
her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for
everything.


One day in Moscow in Princess Mary's presence (she thought her father
did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle
Bourienne's hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.

Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room.
.
.
.
.
 and he doesn't obey! She is the
first person in this house; she's my best friend," cried the prince.
 Go!
Don't let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!"

Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne's pardon, and also her
father's pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged
for her intervention.


At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul.
 "He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn
him!" she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against
herself.
 It happened that on that
morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods.


"The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.
 I am calm.
 I have thought it over, and it will be carried
out--we must part; so find some place for yourself.
.
" But he could not
restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves
is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and
screamed:

"If only some fool would marry her!" Then he slammed the door, sent for
Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.


At two o'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
 Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
everything was going from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or
giving an opinion the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the
point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.


Pierre now understood the count's dissatisfaction with the wording of
the Note.
 On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was
impossible to pass any judgment.
 "You know Metivier? I turned him
out of my house this morning.
 He was here; they admitted him in spite of
my request that they should let no one in," he went on, glancing angrily
at his daughter.


And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the
reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy.
 The guests rose to congratulate
the old prince.
 Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
 Our political interests are
all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have
an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare to cross the
Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!"

"How can we fight the French, Prince?" said Count Rostopchin.
 "Can we
arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our youths,
look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of
Heaven.


"French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned
Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a
scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees.
 Ah, when one looks at our young people,
Prince, one would like to take Peter the Great's old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
out of them.
.


"Oh yes," she answered.
 "You noticed nothing?" her look asked.
"

"No, not long.
 I
can read him like a book.
 I should like
to tell everything to Pierre.
 It would be a
relief.
 "Ah, how
bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that.
.
" she went
on in a trembling voice, "that you can do nothing for him but grieve
him, and to know that you cannot alter this.
 Then there is only one
thing left--to go away, but where could I go?"

"What is wrong? What is it, Princess?"

But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into
tears.

"I was told they are coming soon.
 I am also expecting Andrew any day.
"

"And how does he now regard the matter?" asked Pierre, referring to the
old prince.


"What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up.
"

An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and repeated
requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on the
princess' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should
disapprove of Andrew's choice; but in reply he said what he felt rather
than what he thought.
.


Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sister-in-law as soon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the
old prince to her.
 Though Princess Mary
despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,
without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her.
 Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
much in life.
 This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing
herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
passing the time pleasantly.

"It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness and
despair, showing the possibility of consolation.
"

In reply Boris wrote these lines:

    Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible,
    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,
    Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,
    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,
    Et mele une douceur secrete
    A ces pleurs que je sens couler.
 Meeting at large gatherings
Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood
one another in a world of indifferent people.
 He has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive," said she to the
mother.
 He
laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had
to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and
Nizhegorod estates.
 His leave was expiring.
 On the contrary.
.






CHAPTER VI


At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with Natasha and
Sonya.
 Prince Andrew was expected in
Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his
future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in Moscow
could not be missed.


Late one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs drove into Marya Dmitrievna's
courtyard in the old Konyusheny street.


She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation--the possibility of
which she did not admit.
 On ordinary days, after
dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there
were always some.
 She rarely made an exception and went out to
pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.
.
 Bonjour, Sonya dear!" she added,
turning to Sonya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly
contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.
 "The old man is here
and his son's expected any day.
 You'll have to make his acquaintance.
 "What do you want tomorrow? Whom will
you send for? Shinshin?" she crooked one of her fingers.
 The son is
getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is here too, with his wife.
 As for them"--and she pointed to the girls--"tomorrow I'll
take them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then
we'll drive to the Super-Rogue's.
 And what have you to do yourself?" she
asked the count sternly.


"One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house.
 If you
will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
day, and leave my lassies with you.
"

"All right.
 All right.
 Now listen! You
know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son's marrying.
 Be kind, and use your wits.
 When he comes, he'll find
you already know his sister and father and are liked by them.
 Am I right
or not? Won't that be best?"

"Yes, it will," Natasha answered reluctantly.






CHAPTER VII


Next day, by Marya Dmitrievna's advice, Count Rostov took Natasha to
call on Prince Nicholas Bolkonski.
 "Everybody always has
liked me, and I am so willing to do anything they wish, so ready to
be fond of him--for being his father--and of her--for being his
sister--that there is no reason for them not to like me.
 The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another.
 She
thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain.
.


"Ah, madam!" he began.
 Countess Rostova, if I am
not mistaken.
.
 God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a
visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter.


Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the prince's indisposition.
 "I couldn't begin
talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman," thought Natasha.
 She knew what
she ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been unable to say it
because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because, without
knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage.


"Dear Natalie," said Princess Mary, "I want you to know that I am glad
my brother has found happiness.
 Natasha noticed
this and guessed its reason.


They waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner that day.
"

"Don't talk about it, Natasha.
 But it all hurts terribly.
.
 "And how can Sonya love Nicholas
so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently?" thought she,
looking at Sonya, who also came in quite ready, with a fan in her hand.

"No, she's altogether different.


"Natasha, your hair!.


An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box.
 A sensation she had not
experienced for a long time--that of hundreds of eyes looking at
her bare arms and neck--suddenly affected her both agreeably and
disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and
emotions associated with that feeling.
 Her black eyes looked at
the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to
above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently
unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,
crumpling her program.
.
.
 She turned away and suddenly remembered all that
had been so humiliating in her morning's visit.
 "And where has he sprung from?" he
asked, turning to Shinshin.
 "Didn't he vanish somewhere?"

"He did," replied Shinshin.
 They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in
Persia, where he killed the Shah's brother.

While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
looked round and, meeting the count's eyes, nodded to him and smiled.
 "I
suppose it has to be like this!" she thought.
 Countess Bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer, and
Natasha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally
handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet
courteous bearing.
 In the stalls everyone began moving about, going
out and coming in.


The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, and Natasha
gave Boris a similar smile.
 She even turned so
that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming
aspect.
 The Rostovs had not seen him since their arrival.

He passed up to the front rows, not noticing anyone.
 On seeing Natasha Pierre grew animated and, hastily passing between
the rows, came toward their box.
 While conversing
with Pierre, Natasha heard a man's voice in Countess Bezukhova's box and
something told her it was Kuragin.


"I want to become a Moscovite too, now," said Helene.
 I
have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know
you," said she to Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile.
 She sang something mournfully, addressing the
queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare
legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together.
 But suddenly a storm
came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,
and the curtain dropped.
 Once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting: "Duport! Duport! Duport!" Natasha no longer thought this
strange.


"Let me introduce my brother to you," said Helene, her eyes shifting
uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.


Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder.
 But looking into his eyes she was
frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
always felt between herself and other men.
 When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind
by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck.
 She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
something improper.
 Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.
 "You'll come to the
costume tournament, Countess? Do come!" and putting out his hand to her
bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, "You will be the prettiest
there.
 She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark.


The curtain rose again.
 Natasha
went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the
world she found herself in.
 As he was
putting Natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow.
 Agitated and
flushed she turned round.
 Everything seemed dark, obscure,
and terrible.
 There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the
bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the
music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly naked
Helene with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried "bravo!"--there in
the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear and simple; but now,
alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.


Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all she
was feeling.


Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre's house.
 At that time while with his
regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to
marry his daughter.
 More than once he had vexed his father by
spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds.
"

Dolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and
dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kuragin and made
use of him for his own ends.


Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin.
 She
continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
would happen to her before he came.
 The
question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she
had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found
herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and
every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
feeling.
 To the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was
far less tranquil and happy than before.


After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited
on the Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying
on the new dresses.
 Natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door
opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with
a high collar, came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable
smiles.
 As she was leaving the Rostovs she called
her protegee aside.
" And
again, under Helene's influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed
simple and natural.
 And why not enjoy myself?" thought Natasha,
gazing at Helene with wide-open, wondering eyes.
 It will divert your thoughts," she
added, addressing Natasha.

Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and followed
her.


Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
beauty and her dress.


Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl
draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and
assumed an unnatural pose.


After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.


"How beautiful she is!" Natasha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.
 "You are
enchanting.
.
.
 from the moment I saw you I have never ceased.


The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not to spoil her
improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on.
 I am betrothed and love another," she said
rapidly.
.
.
"

Natasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open
frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual.
 Helene had disappeared leaving them
alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice:

"I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see
you? I love you madly.
.
 Natasha looked round at her, and then, red
and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved
toward the door.


"Natalie, just a word, only one!" he kept repeating, evidently not
knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them.


Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room.






CHAPTER XIV


Morning came with its cares and bustle.
 Well, I had a talk with him.


"Yes, go back," said Marya Dmitrievna, "and wait there.
 If the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,
against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe.


"That is perfectly true.
 "What I say is true!
Write an answer!" Natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read
Princess Mary's letter.
 "Dear Princess," she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and
then paused.
 What more could she write after all that had happened
the evening before? "Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is
changed," she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before
her.
.
 "Can it be
that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went
before?" She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former
strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin.


"Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or
to die.
 Love would conquer all.
 Natasha, pleading a headache, remained at home.
 Sonya picked it up and read it.
 Her
face was calm, gentle, and happy.
 "But it can't be that
she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was
from.
 Probably she is offended by it.


"Sonya, you've read that letter?" she demanded.


Natasha smiled rapturously.


"No, Sonya, I can't any longer!" she said.


"And Bolkonski?" she asked.
 "You don't
know what love is.
 "I don't understand.
.
.
.
 It's not the same as before.
 You don't understand that.


"But think what you are doing," cried Sonya.
 "Why can't you
understand? I love him!"

"Then I won't let it come to that.
 I shall tell!" cried Sonya,
bursting into tears.


"For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me," Natasha
entreated.
 "Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have
confided in you.
.
.


"Sonya, one can't doubt him! One can't, one can't! Don't you
understand?" she cried.


"Does he love you?"

"Does he love me?" Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend's
lack of comprehension.


"If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
cease seeing you; and if you won't do this, I will.
 "Go
away, Sonya! I don't want to quarrel with you, but go, for God's sake
go! You see how I am suffering!" Natasha cried angrily, in a voice of
despair and repressed irritation.



On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday
the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.


"There, Sonya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,"
Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
praised.
 He was glad I was free to refuse him.
 Why do
you think so badly of me?"

"I don't think anything, only I don't understand this.
"

"Wait a bit, Sonya, you'll understand everything.


"Natasha, I am afraid for you!"

"Afraid of what?"

"I am afraid you're going to your ruin," said Sonya resolutely, and was
herself horrified at what she had said.
 With the same
expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,
taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.


Hard as it was for Sonya, she watched her friend and did not let her out
of her sight.


Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful
plan for that evening.


"She will run away with him!" thought Sonya.
 There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her
face today.
 She cried as she said good-by to Uncle," Sonya remembered.
 What am I to do? Write
to Kuragin demanding an explanation? But what is there to oblige him
to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some
misfortune?.
.
.
.
 The plan for Natalie Rostova's
abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dolokhov a few
days before, and on the day that Sonya, after listening at Natasha's
door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put into execution.
 Kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have
ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka, where an
unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over
them.


Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles
he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
Dolokhov's help.


Two witnesses for the mock marriage--Khvostikov, a retired petty
official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
Makarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded
affection for Kuragin--were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's front room.
 Dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down.
.
 "I am speaking seriously.
 Why should
I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who
found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it
all.
 Do you think I am not grateful?" And Anatole
sighed and embraced Dolokhov.


"I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a
dangerous business, and if you think about it--a stupid business.
 Why, they'll have you in the
criminal court.
.
"

"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace.
.
 Then, I don't know.
.
 Balaga was a famous troyka
driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and had given
them good service with his troykas.
 But
he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked
upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full
gallop through the Moscow streets.


Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and
because he liked the things they liked.
"

And Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give him a thousand
or a couple of thousand rubles.


"Theodore Ivanych!" he said, bowing.


"I say, Balaga," said Anatole, putting his hands on the man's shoulders,
"do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service.


"Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make jokes!" cried Anatole,
suddenly rolling his eyes.
"

"Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!" said Anatole, and filled a large
glass of Madeira for him.
 After refusing
it for manners' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
handkerchief he took out of his cap.
 We came across a train of loaded sleighs and
drove right over two of them.
"





CHAPTER XVII


Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing
a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one
side and very becoming to his handsome face.
 Having looked in a mirror,
and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,
he lifted a glass of wine.
.
of my youth, farewell!" he said, turning to Makarin and the others.
.


"No, stop!" said Anatole.
 "Shut the door; we have first to sit down.


"Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, the sable!" he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms.


A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable
mantle on her arm.


"Well, good-by, Matrena," said Anatole, kissing her.


Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
holding the horses.






CHAPTER XVIII


Marya Dmitrievna, having found Sonya weeping in the corridor, made her
confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natasha she read it and
went into Natasha's room with it in her hand.

Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor.
.
 "Disgusting,
abominable.
 "Hard as it may
be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
count.
 Natasha lying on the
sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir.


"A nice girl! Very nice!" said Marya Dmitrievna.
 Marya Dmitrievna glanced
round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.
 "Do you hear what I am saying or not?" she added.
 Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her
cheeks sunken.
 What is it to me?.
.
 But listen.
 "If they hear of
this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him.
.
 Well, if he
had carried you off.
 Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under her head,
covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower
water, but Natasha did not respond to her.
 With compressed
and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily
watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
anyone who entered the room.
 "What is the matter
with you, my angel? Are you ill?" asked the count.
 Marya Dmitrievna
confirmed Natasha's assurances that nothing had happened.


When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya
Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed.


On the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.


"Pierre! Been back long?" someone shouted.
 Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
head slightly bent.


"Yes, indeed, that's a true sage," thought Pierre.


In Marya Dmitrievna's anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.
 He thought of his wife.


"But how get married?" said Pierre, in answer to Marya Dmitrievna.
 "A
nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she's expecting him--expecting
him since yesterday.


"Mind, the count knows nothing.


Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset.


"Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!" he said to Pierre.
 "What troubles
one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having
come here.
 Of course he is an excellent man, but
still, with his father's disapproval they wouldn't have been happy, and
Natasha won't lack suitors.
 Still, it has been going on so long, and
to take such a step without father's or mother's consent! And now she's
ill, and God knows what! It's hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in
their mother's absence.
.


"Natasha is not quite well; she's in her room and would like to see you.

Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.
 "Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all
was!"

And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
room.


Natasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, and her
eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the
moment he entered.
"

"Then it is not true that he's married!"

"Yes, it is true.
"

"Has he been married long?" she asked.






CHAPTER XX


Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.
 One of Pierre's acquaintances, while they were talking about
the weather, asked if he had heard of Kuragin's abduction of Rostova
which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and
said it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs'.


"Ah, Pierre," said the countess going up to her husband.
.


"You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to elope with
her, is that so?"

"Mon cher," answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),
"I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
tone.
.
 I didn't think of it.
.
"

Pierre interrupted him.

I know I can't prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of
conscience.


"After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
a thing as other people's happiness and peace, and that you are ruining
a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women
like my wife--with them you are within your rights, for they know what
you want of them.
 Don't you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
or a child?.
"

Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a
questioning look.






CHAPTER XXI


Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment of her
wish that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow.
 The whole house was in
a state of alarm and commotion.
 Pierre saw the distracted count, and
Sonya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.


He was awaiting Prince Andrew's return with dread and went every day to
the old prince's for news of him.
 He seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience.


Some days after Anatole's departure Pierre received a note from Prince
Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.
 To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
him all the blame of other men's mistakes is very easy, but I maintain
that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
him, by him alone.


"Posterity will do him justice," he concluded, and at once turned to
Pierre.


"Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?" he said with animation, but
the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened.
"

After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish
frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and
about M.
 "I do
not, and never did, like Speranski personally, but I like justice!"

Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
 A bed had been made
up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about.


"Give this to the countess.
.
.
 I can't.
.
.
 Princess Mary was the same as
always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her
satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off.


"But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been
tidied up.
"

"No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room," said Sonya.


"When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don't
tell her everything!" said she to Pierre.
 "One hasn't the heart to scold
her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.
.
.
"

He did not know what to say.


Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
had meant.
"

She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.


A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre's heart.


"I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more," said Pierre.
 I should like to know one thing.
.


"I should like to know, did you love.
.
" Pierre did not know how to
refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him--"did you love that
bad man?"

"Don't call him bad!" said Natasha.
"

Pierre grew confused.


"Where to?" Pierre asked himself.
 In Pierre, however, that comet with its long
luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear.
 On the contrary he gazed
joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having
traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
space, seemed suddenly--like an arrow piercing the earth--to remain
fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars.


Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
term then also there could have been no war.
 So all these causes--myriads of causes--coincided to bring it
about.
 And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had
to occur because it had to.


The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription.


There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which
is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive
life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.
 A deed done
is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
millions of other men assumes an historic significance.


When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its
attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried
by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or
because the boy standing below wants to eat it?

Nothing is the cause.
 All this is only the coincidence of conditions in
which all vital organic and elemental events occur.
 Equally
right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he
wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and
he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock.
 In historic
events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and
like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.



    * Old style.
 Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things
get hot.
 by heaven!.
 Good
luck!.
.
.
.


Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log
that lay on the bank.


As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,
with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted "Vivat!"
and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped
into the river.
 He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown
restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest
part where the current was swift.
 They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,
though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they
were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing.
 When
the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,
ventured to draw the Emperor's attention to the devotion of the Poles
to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having
summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.


For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to
dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion.
 The colonel and some of his men got across and with
difficulty clambered out on the further bank.
 *


    * Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.
 Nothing was ready for the
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come
from Petersburg.


It was a gay and brilliant fete.
 Boris
was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
own age.
 He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen her for
a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was enjoying
the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only recently
married, they met as good friends of long standing.
 Boris, coolly looking at Helene's dazzling bare shoulders
which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her
of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and
unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor
who was in the same room.
 Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly
at Balashev and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady
and turned to him.
 (Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev and
was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor
otherwise than through himself.
 The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and
remained there about another half-hour.
 On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation
and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully
expressed his feelings, and has since become famous.
 On returning home
at two o'clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishkov, and told
him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal
Prince Saltykov, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on
Russian soil.
 In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was
never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of
it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
at his post.
 There he
was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.


The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,
advanced his horse's chest against Balashev, put his hand to his saber,
and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that
he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned who he was.


Balashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
village.
 The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked
silently at one another from time to time.


It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of
martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.
 He wore a red
mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion.
" Though it was quite
incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,
and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more
solemn and important air than formerly.


"De Bal-macheve!" said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel).


As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
natural tone of good-natured familiarity.


"Your Majesty," replied Balashev, "my master, the Emperor, does not
desire war and as Your Majesty sees.


Murat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to "Monsieur
de Bal-macheve.
" But royaute oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on
him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander's
envoy.
 I will send it to
the Emperor.
.
"

Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev's face.






CHAPTER VI


Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury
and magnificence of Napoleon's court.
 His plump white neck
stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
of Eau de Cologne.
 Even now" (he emphasized the word) "I am ready to receive
any explanations you can give me.
"

And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
dissatisfaction with the Russian government.
" but the sight of the Emperor's eyes
bent on him confused him.


"Not yet!" interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his
feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev might
proceed.
.
 Here Balashev hesitated:
he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his
letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had
told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon.
 Balashev remembered these words,
"So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil," but some
complex feeling restrained him.
 Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in
a louder tone and more hurriedly than before.
 "Have
I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I
have waited eighteen months for explanations.
 But in order to begin
negotiations, what is demanded of me?" he said, frowning and making an
energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.
 "So now you want me to retire beyond
the Niemen--only the Niemen?" repeated Napoleon, looking straight at
Balashev.
 "The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,"
he remarked at a later date.
 You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his
army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I
have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when
your position is a bad one.


But Napoleon did not let him speak.
 He evidently wanted to do all the
talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.


"What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might have been!"

He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter tried
to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.


"What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
through my friendship?" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
in perplexity.
.
 And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,
Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,
does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.
 He's stupid, but he has experience,
a quick eye, and resolution.
 A sovereign should not be with
the army unless he is a general!" said Napoleon, evidently uttering
these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor.
 He knew how Alexander
desired to be a military commander.
 You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish
provinces.
.
 The Turks will
be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
peace with you.
 Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking
at the movements of Napoleon's stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
his eyes.
 "I have
allies--the Poles.
 Yes, that is what will happen to you.
 I have
convinced you.
"

When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed
at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal.
"

And Napoleon went quickly to the door.






CHAPTER VII


After all that Napoleon had said to him--those bursts of anger and the
last dryly spoken words: "I will detain you no longer, General; you
shall receive my letter," Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon would
not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him--an
insulted envoy--especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger.
 He not only showed no sign
of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev.
 From all
the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his
monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved
their handkerchiefs to him.


"I beg your Majesty's pardon," returned Balashev, "besides Russia there
is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.


The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
were puzzled as to what Balashev's tone suggested.
 So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not
notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns the
direct road from there to Moscow passed.


Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
consider everyone his friend.
 Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
deliberating," continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
self-confident smile.
 "What I can't understand," he went on, "is that
the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.


To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the French court.


"Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don't you say
anything?" said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the
adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon.
 "Let him have mine, he has a long way to
go!"

The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.
 So Prince Andrew, having received an
appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.

He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to meet Kuragin
personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel.
 But he again
failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,
the latter returned to Russia.
 After his betrothed had broken
faith with him--which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
conceal its effects--the surroundings in which he had been happy became
trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized
so highly were still more so.
 It was as if
that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in
which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
 He alone did not obey the law of
immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle.


During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they
were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
feel awkward.
 The
old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
her and that she deserved it.
.
 That day he did not see his father, who did not
leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and
Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone.
 The boy,
curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell
into a reverie without finishing the story.
 He thought not of this
pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself.
 He
sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret
at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,
and was horrified to find neither.


As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and
especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,
and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
soon as possible.
 "I am very sorry you
can't.
 "Why do you say that,
when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle
Bourienne says he has been asking about you.
.
"

As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
began to fall.
 "Sorrow is sent by Him,
not by men.
 Men are His instruments, they are not to blame.
 If you think
someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to
punish.
 Only senseless
things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to
Prince Andrew's mind.
 His mind
was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting
a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the
distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin.
 The
Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief.
 Arakcheev was a faithful
custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign's bodyguard.

Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna province who appeared to be doing
the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful
as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay.
 To
this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and
others, chiefly Germans.
 At that time a
famous joke of Ermolov's was being circulated, that as a great favor he
had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German.


To the third party--in which the Emperor had most confidence--belonged
the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.
 They insisted on the retention
of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel's plan, but on changing the
movements of the other armies.

They said: "Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!
We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall abandon Drissa.
 If Barclay is now to
be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his
incapacity already in 1807.


The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the
others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing--as much advantage
and pleasure for themselves as possible.


The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
chiefly from the Emperor's presence in the army with his military court
and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,
and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but
harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the
army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor
and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor
paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief if independent
would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
authority of the monarch.
 In this letter, availing himself of permission given him
by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully
suggested--on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
a warlike spirit in the people of the capital--that the Emperor should
leave the army.
 It was not a council of war, but,
as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor
personally.
 There was about
him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
typical than any of them.
.
.
.
.
 The
German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more
repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the
truth--science--which he himself has invented but which is for him the
absolute truth.
 He was even pleased by failures, for failures
resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
the accuracy of his theory.


He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the present
war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,
and who is not displeased that it should be so.


"And as for the man who advised forming this camp--the Drissa camp,"
said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince
Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, "as to that person, sire.


"I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait
for me.
 He was followed by Prince Peter
Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.

Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor's permission, accompanied
Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the
council was assembled.


Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, as it were,
of chief of the Emperor's staff.
 It was one of the millions of proposals, one as
good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown
what character the war would take.


During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen
(his "bridge" in court relations), were silent.
 Pfuel only snorted
contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean
himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing.
"

But when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor's name
that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,
began to speak:

"Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they
knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There
is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly
adhered to," said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers.


Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.

Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German.
 Toll explained to Volkonski in
Russian.
 Besides this, the remarks
of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable
at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon's
genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.
 "What theory and science is possible about a
matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
the enemy's armies will be in a day's time, and no one can gauge the
force of this or that detachment.

And why do they all speak of a 'military genius'? Is a man a genius who
can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are
invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,
attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess.
 "Nothing but honor could keep
me from returning to the country.
" thought he.
 If they regretted having to retreat, it was only
because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some
pretty young Polish lady.
 Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the
drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,
and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking
advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,
carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors.
 Rostov remembered
Sventsyani, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
of old beer.


The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which
was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
horses.
 An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending
onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
rain, entered Rostov's shelter.


"I have come from the staff, Count.


Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of
the Saltanov dam being "a Russian Thermopylae," and of how a deed worthy
of antiquity had been performed by General Raevski.
 So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose
his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Petya
there, or even Ilyin, who's a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would
have tried to put them somewhere under cover," Nicholas continued
to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski.
 And he acted accordingly.
.
 The doctor, whether from lack
of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in
the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the
hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
the hussar officers.
 Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump little blonde
German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench
in the front corner.
 Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.


"And why do you stand there gaping?"

"What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don't make our
drawing room so wet.


A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove.
 Rostov received
his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendrikhovna to stir
it.
"

When they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards and
proposed that they should play "Kings" with Mary Hendrikhovna.


"As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!"

They had hardly begun to play before the doctor's disheveled head
suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna.
 Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked
to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way.

Rostov riding in front gave the order "Forward!" and the hussars, with
clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses' hoofs splashing in the
mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone
on in front.
 The soldiers' faces were more and more clearly visible.
 And with that light, and as
if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.
 Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out
before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement
of the Uhlans.
 He could already see how these men, who looked so small
at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their
arms and their sabers in the air.
 He looked
around.
.
"

Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to
the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the
word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following
him.
 The bullets were whining and whistling so
stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
not restrain himself.

Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they
drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after
them.
 On seeing the hussars, the
foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt.
 The hussars galloped hastily
back with their prisoners.


Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for Rostov,
thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor
and would recommend him for a St.
 Ostermann's flattering words and promise of a reward should
therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt
that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea.

Rostov still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.


All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rostov,
without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.
.


Natasha's illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for
her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,
her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
background.
 Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in
French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great
variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple
idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
Natasha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be
known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always
has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to
medicine--not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and
so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the
innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs.
.
 She not merely avoided all external
forms of pleasure--balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters--but she
never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter.
 She said and felt at that time that no
man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon.
 She kept away from everyone in
the house and felt at ease only with her brother Petya.
 She liked to
be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she
sometimes laughed.
 It would have been
impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the
same time more seriously than did Count Bezukhov.
 She suggested that Natasha should fast
and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the idea.

Despite the doctor's orders that she should not go out early in the
morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,
not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov family by attending
three services in their own house, but as Agrafena Ivanovna did, by
going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,
Matins, or Mass.
 Agrafena Ivanovna used to come to wake Natasha
at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake.
 When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that
the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to
understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments.


During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every
day.
 And the happiness of taking communion, or "communing" as Agrafena
Ivanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natasha
so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.
"

The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her
nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.


"That's Rostova, the one who.
.
 With a
sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself
in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace
walked--as women can walk--with the more repose and stateliness the
greater the pain and shame in her soul.
 She knew for certain that she
was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.
" She stood by her mother's side and exchanged
nods with acquaintances near her.
.
.
 When they prayed for those who love us,
she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and
Sonya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them.
 When they
prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and
people who hated her, in order to pray for them.
 Only at prayer did
she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,
as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
devotion to God.
 The priest came out with his purple velvet
biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.
 Then came the prayer just received from the Synod--a prayer
for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.
 She
shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,
for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation
by love.
 She
felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own
sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to
give them all, and her too, peace and happiness.
 That terrible question "Why?" "Wherefore?" which had come to him
amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a
reply to the former question, but by her image.
 Whatever worldly baseness
presented itself to him, he said to himself:

"Well, supposing N.
 One of his brother Masons had revealed to
Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the
Revelation of St.
 Moreover, by applying the same system to the words
quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that "spoke
great things and blasphemies," the same number 666 was obtained; from
which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon's power had come
in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two.



    * Forty-two.


Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
 He knew that when his master was
at the Rostovs' he stayed till midnight.


The first person he saw in the house was Natasha.
 He knew that she had not sung since her
illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him.
 George's Cross? I am so proud of him.
 But I don't want to interrupt you,"
he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.
.
 But why do you ask me?"

"I don't know myself," Natasha answered quickly, "but I should not like
to do anything you disapproved of.
 You
don't know how important you are to me, how much you've done for me.
 If I
were in his place.
 But she did not give him
time to say them.
 To join the hussars? I'll mention it, I'll bring it
all up today.
 They say we're already near Smolensk," replied
Pierre.
 I'll
certainly.
"

"Oh! And my coachman has gone.
.
" said the count.


Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not
to grasp what was said.
"


Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice.
 May the ruin he
hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered
from bondage glorify the name of Russia!"


"Yes, that's it!" cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing
repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he
added, "Let the Emperor but say the word and we'll sacrifice everything
and begrudge nothing.
.


"Never mind what it's for.
.
.
 Fedya Obolenski is younger than I, and he's
going too.
 Besides, all the same I can't study now when.
.
.
"

"Nonsense, I tell you.


"Well, Peter Kirilych, let's go and have a smoke," he said.
.
"

"Yes, I had forgotten.
.
.
 He frowned before his looking glass,
gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word
to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to
avoid notice.
.


It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for success
in reaching the Emperor--he even thought how surprised everyone would be
at his youthfulness--and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.
 But within the Trinity Gateway he
was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
rumbling beneath the archway.
.


"Which is he? Which?" asked Petya in a tearful voice, of those around
him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Petya,
fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the
tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm
on him--though it happened not to be the Emperor--frantically shouted
"Hurrah!" and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the
army.
" cried the crowd, and Petya with
it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Petya among them, wept
with joy.
 Seeing this the Emperor had
a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from
the balcony.
 Petya's eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the
danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits.
 He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated
though she was lying on the ground--she grabbed at some biscuits but
her hand did not reach them.
 Petya pushed her hand away with his knee,
seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted
"Hurrah!" with a voice already hoarse.


The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began
to disperse.


Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman's
uniform that had become too tight for him.


The Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved
about discussing it.
 Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
the speaker and listened.
 Count Ilya Rostov, in a military uniform of
Catherine's time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,
with all of whom he was acquainted.
.


Count Rostov's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
Pierre wanted to speak himself.
 He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say.
.
.
 Pierre stepped forward and
interrupted him.
 He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he
began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing
himself in bookish Russian.
) "Though I don't agree with the gentleman.
.
 With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,
Adraksin shouted at Pierre:

"In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor
about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the
Emperor could not answer such a question.
 The troops are moved
according to the enemy's movements and the number of men increases and
decreases.
 "We
are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, the
throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of
our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of
Russia!"

Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word.
 Many voices
shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostov had not time
to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,
re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
to the big table.
 Not only was Pierre's attempt to speak unsuccessful,
but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away
from him as from a common enemy.
"

"Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!" was repeated approvingly in the back rows
of the crowd.
 With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
to the table.
 Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
some thought and hastened to utter it.
 The old magnates, whom Pierre
knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their
faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
hot.
"





CHAPTER XXIII


At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes,
wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered
the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.
 The Emperor has deigned to summon
us and the merchants.
 Millions will pour forth from there"--he pointed
to the merchants' hall--"but our business is to supply men and not spare
ourselves.
 Pierre
stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said.


There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that
Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying
with emotion:

"I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has
surpassed my expectations.
.
 Pierre was among those who saw him
come out from the merchants' hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.
 Both were
weeping.
 They were
moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining
that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,
but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work
concealed from them but comprehensible to us.


The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
time but its historic results.
 No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance
into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for
a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war
by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
among the Russian people.
 Russian authors are still fonder of telling
us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was
adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some
of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others
to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself--pointing to notes,
projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of action.

But all these hints at what happened, both from the French side and the
Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the event.


Conjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending his
line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths
of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can
historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,
or such plans to the Russian commanders.
 By the Emperor's orders Bagration reported direct to
him.
 I confess I do not want to.
 And these ruined inhabitants, setting
an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own
losses but kindling hatred of the foe.
.
 We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The
princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy
widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only
you, my friend, are missing.
" and so on.


The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of
this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize
it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.

He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
serfs.
 The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that
he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,
changed his sleeping place every day.
 Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.


At dinner that day, on Dessalles' mentioning that the French were said
to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered his son's
letter.


She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
arrived.
 "Prince Andrew is in a
position to know.
 "You go, Michael Ivanovich.


"They can't do anything.
.
 These he put down beside him--not letting anyone read them
at dinner.
 When she had done so
Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father.
 "I have said and still
say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get
beyond the Niemen.
"

Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the
Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,
forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what
her father was saying was correct.


"When the snow melts they'll sink in the Polish swamps.
 Only they
could fail to see it," the prince continued, evidently thinking of the
campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent.
.
"

"But, Prince," Dessalles began timidly, "the letter mentions
Vitebsk.
 "Yes, he
writes that the French were beaten at.
.
.


"The prince says nothing about that," he remarked gently.


"Yes.
.
 She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,
ventured to ask him what her father was doing.


"Always busy," replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic
smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale.
" (One of the prince's favorite occupations of late
had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
and which he called his "will.


"Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.


With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and began
putting it up.
 This happened to him almost every
night.
 Princess Mary
talked some nonsense.
"

He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table--on which stood a
glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle--moved close to the bed, and
putting on his spectacles he began reading.


"The French at Vitebsk, in four days' march they may be at Smolensk;
perhaps are already there! Tikhon!" Tikhon jumped up.
 And he saw before him a plump, rather
sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile
and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same
face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zubov over her
coffin about his right to kiss her hand.
 Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor
for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpatych with
instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as
possible if there was danger.
 The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with
ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpatych liked to have them.
 His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one
of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.


As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid crop
of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the
harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
prince's orders.

Everything not connected with the execution of the prince's orders did
not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.


"Why are they leaving the town?" asked Alpatych.


"That's what I say.
 Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.
 Many
people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,
but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and
service was being held in the churches as usual.
.


"What do I care? Let him hear! We're not dogs," said the ex-captain of
police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.
.
 There it
is again, do you hear?" said he, pointing in the direction whence came
the sounds of firing.


"They've brought us all to ruin.
" and he handed a paper to Alpatych.

"Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to
Moscow.
.
 The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:


"I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest danger
as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any.
"
(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of
Smolensk, 1812.
 A small watchdog ran round
barking in front of the harnessed horses.
 He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.
 Killed the mistress!.
.
"

"What for?" asked Alpatych.
 "We'd have
to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them they're
not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, did a good stroke last
Thursday--sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack.
 Will you have
some tea?" he added.


While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over their
tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for
harvesting.


"Well, it seems to be getting quieter," remarked Ferapontov, finishing
his third cup of tea and getting up.
.
.

They say the other day Matthew Ivanych Platov drove them into the river
Marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.


At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
curiosity.
 Ferapontov's wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under
the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,
listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.
 "Lucky you jumped
aside, or it would have wiped you out!"

Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
on a house close to them.


"What marvels!" she exclaimed, but hearing her master's voice she turned
back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.


Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.


At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
with pale faces round the cook.
.
 Several of them
ran into Ferapontov's yard before Alpatych's eyes.
 Ferapontov's whole household came out too, following Alpatych
and the coachman.


As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
Ferapontov's open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and
knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds.
.


Night had come.
 On the sloping descent to the Dnieper
Alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife, which were slowly
moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.

In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a
house and some shops were on fire.


Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
blazing briskly.
.


At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's pale
worn face.
.


"Well then," continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, "report to them as I
have told you"; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside
him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
 Each day fleecy clouds
floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward
evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.
 The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and
through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
sky.
 They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
mouths.
 The burning of Smolensk and its
abandonment made an epoch in his life.
 He was entirely devoted to the
affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
officers.
 But he was kind and gentle only to those of his
regiment, to Timokhin and the like--people quite new to him, belonging
to a different world and who could not know and understand his past.

But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to
think about entirely apart from general questions.


He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the
march, rode to his father's estate where he had been born and spent his
childhood.
 Prince Andrew rode
up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the
trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up.
 Everything precious and valuable had been
removed to Bogucharovo.


Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:

"When did my father and sister leave?" meaning when did they leave for
Moscow.


"Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?
We have still six hundred quarters left," he inquired.


"He is my refuge! His will be done!" he exclaimed.
 "You
must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
Ryazan estate or to the one near Moscow.
"

Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and burst into sobs.
 But not far from Bald Hills
he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
place by the dam of a small pond.
 He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and
he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
laughter.
 There were sounds of men slapping one another,
yelling, and puffing.


Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,
white, muscular flesh.
 The officer, Timokhin, with his red little nose,
standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing
the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.


"It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't you like to?" said he.


"The prince wants to bathe.
)

I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the
abandonment of Smolensk to the enemy.
 Our
troops fought, and are fighting, as never before.
 With fifteen thousand
men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he
would not hold out even for fourteen hours.
 If
he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about
four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten
thousand, that's war! But the enemy has lost masses.
 We cannot fight in this
way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow.


There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace.
 If it has come to this--we must fight as long as
Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand.
.
 The whole army
bewails it and calls down curses upon him.
.

In Anna Pavlovna's circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were
deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the
effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to
maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole
army corps.

Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a
connecting link between these two circles.
 One of the
visitors, usually spoken of as "a man of great merit," having described
how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the newly chosen chief of the
Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutuzov would be the man
to satisfy all requirements.
 I told them his
election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor.
 That same day Kutuzov was appointed commander
in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
occupied by them.
 Though this was impolite to Prince Vasili in Anna Pavlovna's
drawing room, and also to Anna Pavlovna herself who had received the
news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.
 "I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
reward him if he does right.
"

Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the
man to him.
"

Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:
"If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will
win, but if later, God knows what will happen.
" Napoleon did not smile,
though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words
to be repeated.
"--without knowing why or how
this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.


Lavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
whipped.
 What had really taken place he did
not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling.






CHAPTER VIII


Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
supposed.
 Suddenly several men came
running up the avenue with frightened faces.
 He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very
couch he had so feared of late.


For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same state,
getting neither better nor worse.
 But what it was, no one could tell: it
might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate
to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
 Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually
recurred to her as to how she would order her life now, after that.

These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it.
 Several times she
listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener.
 She could not
sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
but not deciding to do so.
 Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.

She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
sometimes involuntarily fixed on him.
 She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
found an expression of his love of her.
 But she drove these thoughts away with disgust.
.
.


It was quite impossible to understand these sounds.


He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
the right place for it.


"Always thoughts.
.
.


Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs
and tears.


"Weren't you asleep?"

"No, I did not sleep," said Princess Mary, shaking her head.


Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
with difficulty.


"Dear one.
.
 Dearest.
.
" Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
caressing word such as he had never used to her before.
.
 forgive!.
 thank
you!.


He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless.


"Yes.
.
 I.
.
.
 This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who
had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
prompt departure.
.


"Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming!" replied the princess hurriedly,
not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to
avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.

She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
room startled her.
 He was still lying on the
bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess
Mary stop short on the threshold.
 All the force of the
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her.
 "No, he
is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!" And hiding
her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
who held her up.

Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done
as if of its own accord.






CHAPTER IX


Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had always been
absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from
those of Bald Hills.
"

In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the
crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
pleased.

As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their
wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of
them had ever been.

But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and
at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly.
 Alpatych also knew that on the previous day
another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which
was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no
harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would
be paid for anything taken from them.


Soon after the migration to the "warm rivers," in which he had taken
part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of
Bogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for
twenty-three years.
 The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward
respected him and jestingly called him "the Minister.
 But on hearing the
order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent.
 It seemed that no horses
could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.


"Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!" he said, shaking his head.
 "I can see
through you and three yards into the ground under you," he continued,
gazing at the floor in front of Dron.


"You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning
for the princess' things.


"Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,
for Christ's sake!"

"Stop that!" cried Alpatych sternly.
 "I see through you and three yards
under you," he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his
knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had
been able to retain the old prince's favor for twenty years had long
since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of
seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.
 What are you thinking
of, eh?"

"What am I to do with the people?" said Dron.
.
 "Are they drinking?" he asked
abruptly.


And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided.
) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
away and begged to be left in peace.
 It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black
dress and weepers.
 All
their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.

But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle
Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were
the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her.


"Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess," said Mademoiselle
Bourienne after a pause.
 It would be dangerous to move now.

"Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him.
.
"

Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
sobs.


"From whom did you get this?" she asked.
 "We must go at once, at once!" she said,
appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.
 She went into Prince Andrew's
study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
position.


"Dronushka," she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dronushka who
always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her, "Dronushka, now
since our misfortune.
.


"I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy.
"

"Why are there none?" asked the princess.


"They're dying of hunger," said Dron.
 "It's not a case of carting.
"

"But why didn't you tell me, Dronushka? Isn't it possible to help them?
I'll do all I can.
 She had heard vaguely that there
was such a thing as "landlord's corn" which was sometimes given to the
peasants.


"But we have grain belonging to my brother?" she said.
.
 and please don't.
"

Dron came and confirmed Dunyasha's words; the peasants had come by the
princess' order.


"But I never sent for them," declared the princess.
 "You must have given
my message wrong.
"

Dron only sighed in reply.
 That is our common misfortune, and I
shall grudge nothing to help you.
.
.
.
 On the
contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near
Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for
nothing.
 Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.


"But why don't you want to take it?" she asked again.


"Why don't you speak?" she inquired of a very old man who stood just
in front of her leaning on his stick.
.
 We
are sorry for you, but we're not willing.
.
 We don't
agree.
 She felt strange and awkward.
 She
thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused
by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past.
 Now she
could remember it and weep or pray.
 With mournful pleasure she now lingered
over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the
picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in
imagination at this still and mystic hour of night.
 And these pictures
presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
seemed now present, now past, and now future.


She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,
muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray
eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.
 It was sad and painful for him
to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him.
 From behind the door I heard how he
lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't
I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And
perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
to me.
 She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do
neither.
 "Dunyasha!" she screamed wildly, and tearing
herself out of this silence she ran to the servants' quarters to meet
her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.


Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods.
 On the way to
Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned
Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one
another to try Ilyin's horse.
 Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.


"Fine fellows!" said Rostov laughing.
.


"The French," replied Ilyin jestingly, "and here is Napoleon
himself"--and he pointed to Lavrushka.
"

"This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your humble
servant.
 "My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince
Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people"--he
pointed to the peasants--"asks you to come up to the house.
?" He pointed to
the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.
.
.
 "What's the matter?" he asked.
"

"Impossible!" exclaimed Rostov.


At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road,
Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and the
maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the
cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran
away, and the women in the house began to wail.


Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with
rapid steps to the village.
.
.


Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,
resolute steps toward the crowd.
 "It's all one to you! You'll dig up your pot of money and take
it away with you.
"

"To be sure, we all have to die.


"That's it--not against it! You've filled your belly.
.
"

The two tall peasants had their say.
.
.
.
.
.


The two bound men were led off to the master's house.
.


"How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,
you fool?" added the other--"A real fool!"

Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
Bogucharovo house.


"Don't put it in so carelessly," said one of the peasants, a man with a
round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid.
 "Don't catch up against it! It's heavy, lads--solid
books.
 "Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had
only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,"
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject.


"Well, supposing I do love him?" thought Princess Mary.


But Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew angry when he
was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.






CHAPTER XV


On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince Andrew and
sent an order for him to report at headquarters.


Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day and at the
very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time.
 From the
field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
roar of many voices shouting "Hurrah!" to the new commander in chief.

Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces
from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutuzov's absence and of the
fine weather.


Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness' staff
but was himself a new arrival.
.


Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her first
suitor.
 This was a plan of campaign
he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat.


"He's coming! He's coming!" shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.
 When he came up to the guard of
honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were
giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for
nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him.
 But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the
familiar weariness of his expression were still the same.
.
 "Whew.
 whew!" he whistled, and
again glanced at Prince Andrew.


"Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come
along.
.


He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.
"

With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
Konovnitsyn had brought him.
.
 Several times on
glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome
woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding
a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
 "Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness
with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the
house.
 He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there
was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it
was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even
interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard
it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of
a service of prayer.
 What the general was saying was even more clever and to
the point, but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge
and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the
matter--something independent of cleverness and knowledge.
 Prince Andrew saw by the
cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.


"Well, sit down, sit down here.
.


"But above all," added Prince Andrew, "I have grown used to my regiment,
am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me.
.
.
 Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre.
 *
And there were as many advisers there as here.

Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed.
 He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
men.



    * "Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.
 But the advisers n'entendent pas de cette
oreille, voila le mal.
"

     * (2) "When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.
 It was long since people had been as gay in
Moscow as that year.
 They are all
dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.


"Another forfeit for a Gallicism," said a Russian writer who was
present.
 "And he
is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean.
"

"No, I think the sale will come off in a few days," said someone.


"A kindly old man but not up to much.


"All right, one can't talk--how tiresome!"

"What is 'the talk of all Moscow'?" Pierre asked angrily, rising to his
feet.
"


"Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her," said Pierre.
 Catiche
is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another.
"


"Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!"

"But how could one say that in Russian?"





CHAPTER XVIII


When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin's broadsheets
that had been brought that day.
 "There will be less
panic and less gossip," ran the broadsheet "but I will stake my life
on it that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.
 The
second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyazma, that
Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the
inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them
at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low
price.


"If this patience comes out," he said to himself after shuffling the
cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, "if it comes out,
it means.


"Then it will mean that I must go to the army," said Pierre to himself.

"Come in, come in!" he added to the princess.
 The two younger ones had both
married.


"Excuse my coming to you, cousin," she said in a reproachful and
agitated voice.
 What is going
to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting.


"Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna told me today
how our troops are distinguishing themselves.
 At this rate they will soon begin
beating us.
"

"Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the
contrary.
.
 "Everything is quiet in
the city and there is not the slightest danger.
 "He is a
hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot.
"

"Oh, but it's so.
.


"Well then, sell it," said he.
 Hardly anyone he knew was left in town.


To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsovo
to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,
and a trial balloon that was to go up next day.
 It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
the commander in chief.


But the attention of the crowd--officials, burghers, shopkeepers,
peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses--was so eagerly centered
on what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered him.
 The stout
man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to
appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but
suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded
grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for doing so.
 sets his
teeth on edge!" said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,
when the Frenchman began to cry.


"Fool! Idiot!" shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman--a thing he rarely
did.
 "Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!" "I must get away
this very day," he murmured to himself.


On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey--his head coachman who
knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow--that
he would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk, and that his saddle
horses should be sent there.
 This could not all be arranged that day,
so on Evstafey's representation Pierre had to put off his departure till
next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.
 When changing horses that night
in Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
evening.
 (This was the battle of Shevardino.
) He was told that there in
Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer
his questions as to who had won.


Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel
where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
had.






CHAPTER XIX


On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevardino Redoubt was
fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on
the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodino itself took place.
 Napoleon's
historians themselves tell us that from Smolensk onwards he wished
to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had
seen at Smolensk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and
had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
wish to negotiate.


On the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the preceding
battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists a definite and
well-known, but quite false, conception.


Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of
Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that
is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the
twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be
fought there.
 Why was it
more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts
exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at
night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to
observe the enemy.
 By crossing to the other
side of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the
whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian
side) and transferred it to the plain between Utitsa, Semenovsk, and
Borodino--a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other
plain in Russia--and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of
August took place.


Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the
Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that
the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the
battle would have taken place where we expected it.


After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the
morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and
were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
be.


Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
increased by the fact that the Russian commanders--not having fully
realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left
flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
right to left--maintained their extended position from the village of
Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to
left during the battle.
) So the battle of Borodino
did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders'
mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian
army and people) it has been described.
 The battle of Borodino was not
fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the
Shevardino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an
open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous
as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not
merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
disintegration and flight.
 The wounded, bandaged with
rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to
the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another.
 Almost
all of them stared with naive, childlike curiosity at Pierre's white hat
and green swallow-tail coat.
 The
driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one
of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his
little horse.
 His nose
and mouth were twisted to one side.
 Another, a young lad, a fair-haired
recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked
at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile.
.

The peasants--even they have to go," said the soldier behind the cart,
addressing Pierre with a sad smile.
"

In spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words Pierre understood what
he wanted to say and nodded approval.


The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.
 "Anyhow his Serene
Highness knows you and will receive you graciously.
"

The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
.
.
 How do matters
stand?.


"They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?"
And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozhaysk hill,
the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the
sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.
 Yet from
among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my
hat! Strange!" thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tatarinova.


In front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood carriages,
wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels.
 The commander in chief
was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and
hardly any of the staff were there--they had gone to the church service.
 Far in
the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the
cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the sun.
 The ground to the right--along
the course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers--was broken and hilly.
.
"

"Ah, ours! And there?.
.
.
 (It was the Shevardino Redoubt.
"

"Then how about our position?"

"Our position?" replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction.
 "I
can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
entrenchments.
 That's our
center.
 Our right flank is over there"--he pointed sharply to the right,
far away in the broken ground--"That's where the Moskva River is, and
we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones.
 "Well, you see, that's difficult to
explain.
 His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will
probably pass round to the right of the Moskva.


The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might
think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
of it.
.
.
 A bald general with a St.
 George's Cross on his neck
stood just behind the priest's back, and without crossing himself (he
was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which
he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the
patriotism of the Russian people.
 Another general stood in a martial
pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest
while looking about him.

Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
was made for him, was approaching the icon.


With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,
with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into
the crowd and stopped behind the priest.
 He crossed himself with an
accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and
bowed his white head with a deep sigh.


When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily
to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to
rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight.
 His
white head twitched with the effort.






CHAPTER XXII


Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.


Pierre looked round.
 Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his hand
(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),
came up to him smiling.
 He wore a long coat and like
Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.
 An immense and
brilliant suite surrounded him.


"This is what you must do," said Boris.
 You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
will be.
 Of course you know Dmitri
Sergeevich? Those are his quarters," and he pointed to the third house
in the village of Gorki.
 "It is
not at all what Count Bennigsen intended.
.
" Boris shrugged his shoulders, "his Serene
Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him.
.
 It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the
intentions of the French!"

"You mean the left flank?" asked Kaysarov.
 Boris belonged to the
latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutuzov, could
so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
Bennigsen managed everything.
 The faces all expressed
animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of
the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions
of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different
expression he saw on other faces--an expression that spoke not of
personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.
.
.
" Dolokhov was saying.
.
.
 What
heroism, Count!"

Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his
Serene Highness.
 He knew Kutuzov's attention would be caught by those
words, and so it was.
"

"Ah.
 Recite them,
recite them!" said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
 Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
the verses.


When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his hand.
 I beg you to forgive me.


"It will interest you," said he.
 They rode across that bridge into the village of
Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of
troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.
 Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon.
 Bennigsen stopped speaking and,
noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:

"I don't think this interests you?"

"On the contrary it's very interesting!" replied Pierre not quite
truthfully.
 One in particular declared with martial heat that they
were put there to be slaughtered.


Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,
put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as
an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
approaching enemy unexpectedly.
 Bennigsen did not know this and moved
the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
matter to the commander in chief.






CHAPTER XXIV


On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his
elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the further
end of his regiment's encampment.


Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.
 All life
appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been
gazing by artificial light through a glass.
.
 It was all very simple and horrible.
 "To die.
.
.
 simply.
 it interests me," said
Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
"interesting.
" "I wish to see the battle.
 Prince
Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre
addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.


"Why so?" asked Pierre.

"But we daren't.
 But when his Serenity took command everything became
straight forward.
 Now we see light.
"

"Then why was it forbidden?"

Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer
such a question.
 At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might
outflank us, as they had larger forces.
.

So it has been with Barclay.
 While Russia was well, a foreigner could
serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger
she needs one of her own kin.
.
"

Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander in alarm
and bewilderment.
 If we had not said that till
the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened.
 But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most
diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is
killed, but all that is being done at present is only play.
 The fact is
that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only
do not help matters, but hinder.
 They are only concerned with their own
petty interests.
"

"At such a moment?" said Pierre reproachfully.
 I cannot sufficiently
     commend that view.
 They
have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us.


"Yes, yes," answered Prince Andrew absently.

And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army.

"I quite agree with you!"

The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and all
that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved.


"Not take prisoners," Prince Andrew continued: "That by itself would
quite change the whole war and make it less cruel.
"

Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or
not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly checked in his
speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat.
 War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war.
 The military
calling is the most highly honored.
 How does God above look at them and hear
them?" exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice.
 "Ah, my
friend, it has of late become hard for me to live.
 Ah, well, it's not for long!" he
added.


"Oh no!" Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,
compassionate eyes.


He closed his eyes.
.
" and
suddenly he remembered how his love had ended.


Donning his court uniform, M.
 Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and
now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
him down.
 Napoleon,
frowning, looked at him from under his brows.
 So much the worse for the Russian
army.
 Go on.
.
 He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to
him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him
of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at
the other end of Europe, with but one thought--to be worthy of their
Emperor--and but one fear--to fail to please him.


Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
"

De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of
which he had not till then been aware).
 de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with
him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the
officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.


"Vive l'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l'Empereur!" came those
ecstatic cries.
 Let it be said of each of
you: "He was in the great battle before Moscow!"


"Before Moscow!" repeated Napoleon, and inviting M.
 It would
seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,
nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his
marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality
called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the
historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded
Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.



The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche, will
place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the
flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,
which will have forty guns in all directed against it.


General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
howitzers of the Guard's artillery against either one or other of the
entrenchments.


All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
methode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.
 General Campan's division did not seize the
first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood
it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.


As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino to the
redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to advance
simultaneously from the front.


All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
not be executed.
 So the way in which these people killed one
another was not decided by Napoleon's will but occurred independently of
him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
part in the common action.
 It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took
place by his will.
 These dispositions and orders only seem worse
than previous ones because the battle of Borodino was the first Napoleon
did not win.
 The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders
seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks
of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the
very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people
fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a
battle that has been won.


The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were
a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were
criticized--criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive
minuteness.


Napoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as
representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
battles.
"

Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before
the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day.


"Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smolensk?"
continued Rapp.
 Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp.
 I have always said so
and I am beginning to experience it.


"Yes, sire," replied Rapp.

"This cold is tiresome.
 They talk about medicine--what is the good of
medicine when it can't cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but
they don't help at all.
 It is organized for that, it is its
nature.
.
.
 Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.
 He
rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
out of the tent.


"What year did you enter the service?" he asked with that affectation
of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
soldiers.


The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.


"Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!" he kept repeating
pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at
him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.


"What? Has it begun? Is it time?" Pierre asked, waking up.


"Hear the firing," said the groom, a discharged soldier.
 An adjutant accompanied by a
Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.


Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,
spellbound by beauty.

Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.
 All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed
Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino
and the hollows on both sides of the Kolocha.
 They were all looking
at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the
same feelings.
.
 and Christ be with you!" Kutuzov was
saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the
battlefield.


Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down
the knoll.


"I'll go there too, I too!" thought Pierre, and followed the general.


Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,
bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,
galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.

Pierre rode up to them.
 Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,
among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing
going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle.
 He looked about him with a smile which did
not leave his face.
.
 "Still
inquisitive?"

"Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
 We can get a view from there and in
our battery it is still bearable," said the adjutant.
 A bullet, no doubt.


"Is the general here?" asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.


"He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way," someone told him,
pointing to the right.


"Don't trouble about me," said Pierre.
"

Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on.


The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski's Redoubt, and to the
French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,
around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as
the key to the whole position.
 Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
through openings in the earthwork.
"

The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.
 One can't
help being afraid," he said laughing.

They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the
discovery that he did so delighted them.
 But in a gentleman it's wonderful!
There's a gentleman for you!"

"To your places!" cried the young officer to the men gathered round
Pierre.


The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagration's
fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
almost impossible to distinguish anything.
 Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he
observed the faces of those around him.

But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices
and jokes were heard on all sides.


"They've withdrawn the front line, it has retired," said they, pointing
over the earthwork.


"So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you crows! You're scared!" they
shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
had been torn off.
 Once or twice he was shouted at for being
in the way.


"I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left.


"Grapeshot!" the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking
over the wall of the trench.


Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending
double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing.
 Everything
became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre's eyes.
 Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,
now heard nothing else.


A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes
and at the same instant plumped into something.
 Wait!" he shouted.


Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was
sitting.
 Pierre ran down the slope.
 He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.

Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground.


On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
there but that no shots were being fired from the battery.
 He also saw something else
that was strange.
 But the French officer was evidently more
inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre's strong
hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and
tighter.
 But before he reached the foot
of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,
stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward
the battery.
 There were many dead whom
he did not know, but some he recognized.


Pierre ran down the slope once more.


Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at
the battlefield.


From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon
circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
false.
 But before that order was given--almost
as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino--the bridge had been
retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre
had been present at the beginning of the battle.
 On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before
he gave them or could not be and were not executed.
 But even
their orders, like Napoleon's, were seldom carried out, and then but
partially.

Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers
ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians
unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,
and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.
 All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send
infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry--all
such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the
units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less
Napoleon.
 But contrary to what had always happened
in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of the
enemy's flight, these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized
and terrified mobs.
 The generals re-formed them, but their numbers
constantly decreased.
 "How can they need
reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
weak, unentrenched Russian wing?"

"Tell the King of Naples," said he sternly, "that it is not noon yet,
and I don't yet see my chessboard clearly.
 Go!.

Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in
a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
reinforcements.
 Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
generals of the suite around him.
"

Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the
battlefield galloped up.


"Asks for reinforcements?" said Napoleon with an angry gesture.

"Who do you think should be sent there?" he asked of Berthier (whom he
subsequently termed "that gosling I have made an eagle").


The adjutant galloped to Claparede's division and a few minutes later
the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward.
 Napoleon
gazed silently in that direction.

Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the
part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines--a role he so justly
understood and condemned.
 From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing.


Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.


"I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?" said he.
 Assuming the negation to
refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M.
.


A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M.


Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a
few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and
stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
in the baggage wagons.


Despite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that this was
not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former
battles.


The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French
army aroused that horror in Napoleon.


"What? What do you say?" asked Napoleon.
 "Yes, tell them to bring me my
horse.


The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village and its
knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
forth clouds of smoke.
 He could not stop what was going on
before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first
time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.


"Yes, yes, do that," he replied to various proposals.


Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over the
command of the first army, and a request to the duke--whom he said he
could not spare at such an important moment--to return to him.


"Wait a little, gentlemen," said he.
"

But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.
 In the center the French had not got beyond Borodino,
and on their left flank Uvarov's cavalry had put the French to flight.
 On the faces of all
who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,
Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension.
 He was satisfied with
the day's success--a success exceeding his expectations, but the old
man's strength was failing him.

The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running
back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,
concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the
commander in chief with that news.


Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov with a
half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his
cap.


He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to
Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom
he was dealing with.
.


"How.
.


Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
that the French no longer ventured to attack.






CHAPTER XXXVI


Prince Andrew's regiment was among the reserves which till after one
o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk, under heavy artillery
fire.
 Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield.
 All seemed
fully absorbed in these pursuits.
 A battery of artillery was passing in front of
the regiment.
 The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.
.
 Get her leg out! She'll fall.
.
 But
such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had
been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale
and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.

There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given.
 He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the
grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big
strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk
from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers
from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his
palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent.
.
 "One,
another! Again! It has hit.
.
" He stopped and looked at the ranks.
 A
chill ran down his back.
 Again he glanced at the ranks.
"

The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.
 "I cannot, I do not wish
to die.
.
"

He did not finish speaking.
 Prince Andrew
opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going
on around him.
.
"





CHAPTER XXXVII


One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,
holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it.
 He raised his head and looked
about him, but above the level of the wounded men.


"All right, immediately," he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince
Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.


Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
cleared and which a dresser was washing down.
 Yes, it was the same flesh,
the same chair a canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with
horror, as by a presentiment.


There were three operating tables in the tent.

His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely
familiar to Prince Andrew.
 The man was sobbing and choking
convulsively.
 Two doctors--one of whom was pale and trembling--were
silently doing something to this man's other, gory leg.


His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince
Andrew's mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him.
 All
the best and happiest moments of his life--especially his earliest
childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning
over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the
pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life--returned to his
memory, not merely as something past but as something present.


"Oh! Oh, ooh!" he sobbed, like a woman.


The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew
from seeing his face, moved away.
 Anatole was sobbing painfully.
 And suddenly a new unexpected
memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
him.
 I know it!"





CHAPTER XXXVIII


The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the
killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
mind.

With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he
regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.

A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
artificial phantasm of life he had served so long.


"They want more!.
" said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.


"They want more!" croaked Napoleon frowning.
 And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,
and inhuman role predestined for him.


It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
beginning of security.


On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,
peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed
her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all
aggrandizement antinational.



Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner
of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
peoples' welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
the employment of power confer benefactions.

Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,
on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: "Enough,
men! Enough! Cease.
.


The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
the French.
 At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the
way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
beginning.
 But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French
from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all
the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian
army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their
positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.


The French, with the memory of all their former victories during
fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon's invincibility, with the
consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,
twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort.
 To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his
Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring.
 It
could not be.
 By impetus gained, the French army was
still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort
on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
wound it had received at Borodino.
 There is a
well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that
Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite
of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise.

The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
human wills, is continuous.


Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and
attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of
these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.


The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an
extraordinary movement of millions of people.
 To that I must entirely change my
point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the
bells, and of the wind.
 And attempts in this
direction have already been made.
 Behind
it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead
were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal.
 For five weeks after that
there was not a single battle.


But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another
of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle
proved physically impossible.
 And meanwhile, the
very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself
upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
from its aim.
 Kutuzov's wish was to attack next day, and the whole
army desired to do so.
 And the troops retired one more, last, day's march, and
abandoned Moscow to the enemy.
 And all these proposals, based
on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.


A commander in chief's business, it would seem, is simply to choose one
of these projects.
 When had
that question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most
palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on
the twenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the
retreat from Borodino to Fili.
 Some discussed the position that had been
chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
capacity of those who had chosen it.
 Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was
described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.

(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian
army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the
possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.
.
 It would not take place because the
commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but
in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
inevitable abandonment.

This Kutuzov knew well.
.
 The army must retreat and the order to do so must
be given.
 He was convinced that he alone could maintain
command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all
the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,
and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue.






CHAPTER IV


The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov's hut.
 Malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another
came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner
under the icons.
 Those who entered went up one by one to the field
marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others.
 Konovnitsyn's firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by
a tender, sly smile.


Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave his corner and
draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been
placed there to light up his face.
 There was a frown
on every face and only Kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional cough
broke the silence.
" She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he
seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
" (He lurched his heavy body
forward.
) "Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question
I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.

The question is that of saving Russia.


The discussion began.
 Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.
 Ermolov, Dokhturov, and Raevski agreed with Bennigsen.
 The other
generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of
Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.
.
 Some of you will not agree with me.
 "I did not expect this! I did not think
this would happen.
.
"





CHAPTER V


At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating
without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,
Rostopchin, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutuzov.
 They were ashamed
to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
it had to be done.


They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to
whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow.
 They went away each on his
own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away
that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
greatest glory of the Russian people.


In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire.


"Well, yes," said she, "it may be that he has other sentiments for me
than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
on him.
.
" said Helene,
beginning to cry.
.
 The enchanting, middle-aged
Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward
described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
soul.
 It was explained to her that this was la grace.


After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her.
 And
as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
the better of cleverer ones, Helene--having realized that the main
object of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her
to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to
which she received indications)-before parting with her money insisted
that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
should be performed.
 The abbe, a well-fed
man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white
hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Helene and, with a
subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,
occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
subject.
 But the abbe, though he evidently
enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the
matter.
 If now you married again
with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven.
 Meeting Helene at a ball she
stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said
in her gruff voice: "So wives of living men have started marrying
again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been
forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago.
 You have suffered so much.
 That is all I have to say," and
concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
daughter's and move away.
 "Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.
 (You know there is some kind of
connection.
) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days
happy, and as widow of the Grand.
 "Will he agree?"

"Oh, he loves me so!" said Helene, who for some reason imagined that
Pierre too loved her.


Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
marriage was Helene's mother, Princess Kuragina.
 She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
and remarriage during a husband's lifetime, and the priest told her that
it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel
which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
is alive.
.
.
.



    * "Countess, there is mercy for every sin.
 But such
ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.


Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away.
 He
had no idea how long he had been there.
" said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
better understood by them.
 Pierre went on with the
soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
and that he had already passed it.


"So you've found your folk?" said one of them.
.
 I could have run
away from my father, as I wanted to.
 "Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor.
 And they with their simple, kind,
firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides.
 Wishing to
speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his
legs grew cold and bare.
 If there were no suffering, man would not know
his limitations, would not know himself.
 The hardest thing (Pierre went
on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to
unite the meaning of all.
 He glanced at the dirty innyard in the
middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
while carts were passing out of the gate.
 I want
to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream.
 Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken
him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow.
 The anteroom and reception room of his house
were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.
 After greeting Pierre they continued their
conversation.


"If they're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,
but as things are now one can't answer for anything.


"What is it?" asked Pierre.
 Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of
the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will
have some water blessed.
.
"

"Well, of course! That's what we were saying," replied the first
speaker.
 By the by, Count," he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a
smile, "we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,
your wife.
"

"I have heard nothing," Pierre replied unconcernedly.
 "But what have you
heard?"

"Oh, well, you know people often invent things.


"That's not he himself, that's the father of the fellow who wrote the
proclamation," said the adjutant.
 Gabriel Ivanovich
here made the inquiries.
 The proclamation had passed through exactly
sixty-three hands.
 He could
only have had it from the Postmaster.
'
They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: 'I made it
up myself.
' Well, you
know the count," said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,
"he flared up dreadfully--and just think of the fellow's audacity,
lying, and obstinacy!"

 "And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? I
understand!" said Pierre.
 "Klyucharev had his own
sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.
 But he's a good-for-nothing lad!
You know that sort of tradesman's son, a dandy and lady-killer.
 He
attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
for him.
 His father keeps a cookshop
here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God
Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.
.
 A short man was saying
something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.


"Ah, how do you do, great warrior?" said Rostopchin as soon as the short
man had left the room.
 Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?" he
went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which
he nevertheless intended to pardon.
 I like you and don't wish you any harm and--as
you are only half my age--I advise you, as a father would, to cease
all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
possible.
.
 Good-by, my dear
fellow.
 that old
man.
 Suffering is necessary.
.


When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a
special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopchin to
know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving the town.






CHAPTER XII


The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,
till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city.


After Petya had joined Obolenski's regiment of Cossacks and left for
Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized
with terror.
 She tried to
get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Petya, or to get
him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved
possible.
 Petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless
he was transferred to another regiment on active service.
 As long as
Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself
for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at
lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes
and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show--when
he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting
somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it--then
his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other
children.
 The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even of
her husband irritated her.
 In spite of Rostopchin's broadsheets, or because
of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory
rumors were current in the town.
 Some talked about the Moscow militia
which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others
whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had
been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
way from Moscow, and so on.
 It was very bitter for her.
 Petya and Natasha on the contrary, far from
helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
everyone.
 Almost all day long the house resounded with their running
feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter.
 All the doors were open, all the furniture was
being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been
taken down.
 The
countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.
.
 the family
are leaving.
 "Here is our commanding officer.
 ask him," and he pointed to a
stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.


Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
and at once went to meet the major.


"May the wounded men stay in our house?" she asked.
 She and Mavra
Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
yard.


"Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move
into the drawing room.
 Will you let them come? They have nowhere
to go.
 I knew you'd let them come!" she said quickly all in one breath.
.
.


In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.
 She realized that if she said a word about his not
going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the
fatherland--something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there
would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,
hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her as their
protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called
the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,
that very night if possible.
 Without any pretense she
was now afraid of everything.
 The servants ran noisily about the house
and yard, shouting and disputing.
 At first her intervention in
the business of packing was received skeptically.


"The dishes must go in here among the carpets," said she.


"Oh, wait, please!" And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
things.
 "These--yes, these must go among the carpets," she said,
referring to the Saxony china dishes.
 When everything had
been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned
out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases.
"

"I won't!" cried Natasha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung
over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the
carpets.


The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands,
screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes.
 Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went on
expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable
packed as compactly as possible.


But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not
get everything packed.
 The countess had fallen asleep and the count,
having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
 He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood, and was
quite covered by an apron.
 Come in," said Mavra Kuzminichna.


"All right!" said the doctor.


She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.
" she said.


This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.
 Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.
 Not only were huge
sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and
early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants
sent by wounded officers came to the Rostovs' and wounded men dragged
themselves there from the Rostovs' and from neighboring houses where
they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them
a lift out of Moscow.
 Pity these
wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one
cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and
one's own carriages as well.


"Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?" asked the count, and stroking his
bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and
nodded to them.


"Count, be so good as to allow me.
 "I shall be very pleased,
very pleased.
.
.
 In the
yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and
their orderlies were to be seen.


At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who had
been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much
offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could not be left behind.

On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because
her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were
being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
that they should take with them.
 After all, ours are
things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
them!.
.
.
.
 where's the hurry?"

The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.


"Health, at a time like this?" said the count.
 "The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so
to say, have now assembled in council.
 those.
 yes, those exploits of antique
valor," he went on rapidly.
 "General Barclay de Tolly risked his life
everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you.
 But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get
away.
"

"I can't think what the servants are about," said the countess, turning
to her husband.


"And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa," said he.


"Hm.
.
.
 I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a
small chiffonier and a dressing table.
 You know how dear Vera wanted a
chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.
" (At the mention
of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone
to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.
.


"Ask the countess, I don't give orders.
 The loaded carts were still standing in the
yard.


She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.
 The count
stood still at the window and listened.
"

"What's the matter with you? Who are 'they'? What do you want?"

"Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mamma.
.
.
.
.
 The
wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
happy faces round the carts.
 "Dunyasha can go
with me in the carriage.


"What could we fasten this onto?" asked the servants, trying to fix a
trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage.
 "We must keep at least
one cart.


"The count's books.


"On the box.






CHAPTER XVII


Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages, packed
full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door.

Natasha was not in the room.


"Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us," said Sonya.


"You say he is dying?"

Sonya nodded.


"The ways of God are past finding out!" she thought, feeling that the
Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was
now taking place.
.


Sonya sighed and made no reply.
 The count, Petya, Madame Schoss, Mavra
Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having closed
the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
seated without looking at one another.
 All the others did the same.
 Then the count embraced
Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while
they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words.

(The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,
were being taken with them.


"They always will forget everything!" said the countess.
 At last all were
seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,
somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out
and said what she had to say.
 "Start!" The
postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,
the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed.
 In the
carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they
passed the church opposite the house.
 She knew it was right in front.


As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was
inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:

"Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!"

"Who? Who?"

"Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!" said Natasha, putting her head
out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman's
long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently
a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the
Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man
in a frieze coat.


But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street came
more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at to move
on and not block the way.


In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostovs
all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a coachman's
coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a
small, beardless old man who looked like a footman.


"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is
wonderful!" she cried, holding out her hand to him.
 "Yes, in Moscow.


"You were at the battle, we heard.
.


When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his
interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out
where he was and what was expected of him.
 Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat
down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door
of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing
his arms, and took up a book.
 or no! No, of course.
 go and say I will
come directly," Pierre replied to the major-domo.

There was no one in the passage.

Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhok five
years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answer to his knock.


Pierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's half-insane
brother and a hard drinker.
 "Will you step into the study?" Pierre nodded.
 "As
it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Danilovna gave orders
that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.


Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.
 I want peasant clothes and a pistol,"
said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.
 Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling
along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked
ingratiatingly at Pierre.
 They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and
to the fords and the boats.
 The
main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.


At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,
Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at
the panorama spread out before him.
 Moscow seen from the Poklonny
Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
glittering like stars in the sunlight.


"Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou la sainte.
"


"A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,"
thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smolensk).
 From that point of
view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before.
 In the clear morning light he gazed now at
the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance
of possessing it agitated and awed him.

"Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men," he reflected,
glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
forming up.
 On
the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great
words of justice and mercy.

I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
monarch.
 He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the
hearts of the people.



     * "My dear, my tender, my poor mother.
"


Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite.
 The faces of those who were not conferring
together were pale and perturbed.
"

The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon
his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the
outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under
his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
.


In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
seems as much alive as other hives.
 From the alighting board, instead
of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm
whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
with the smell of honey.
 There are no longer sentinels sounding the
alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the
hive.
 There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,
like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of
disorder.
 In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
honey fly timidly and shiftily.
 Instead of a
neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,
there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees
scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared
away.
 In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack
some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or
killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap
of corpses.
 "What an incredible
event!"

He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogomilov
suburb.


The coup de theatre had not come off.
 They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and
themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants.
 Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads.
 Two officers, one
with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,
the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka
Street, talking.
"

"Where are you off to?.
.
 Where?.


The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with
him into the arcade.
 A
shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,
persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and
ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.
 "Be so good as to protect us! We won't grudge
trifles, you are welcome to anything--we shall be delighted! Pray!.
.


"Eh, what twaddle!" said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man.
 "When
one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's hair! Take what any of you
like!" And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
officer.
 "In my three shops here I have a
hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods.
'"

"Come inside, your honor!" repeated the tradesman, bowing.
 The
officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that
moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskva
bridge and the officer ran out into the square.


"What is it? What is it?" he asked, but his comrade was already
galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which the
screams came.
 Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
harnessed.
 The
Povarskaya was quite still and deserted.
 The huge courtyard of the
Rostovs' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
horses, and not a soul was to be seen there.


"Only fancy!" answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening grin on his
face in the mirror.
 "How he's grinning, the fat mug!
Is that what you're here for? Nothing's cleared away down there and
Vasilich is worn out.
 "Go and get the samovar to
boil for your grandfather.
"

Mavra Kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and
with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
 Someone
stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.

Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.


The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to
enter or not, clicked his tongue.
.
.
 One little moment," said she.
 Just then Mavra Kuzminichna appeared from behind
the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a
rolled-up check kerchief in her hand.
.
.
 "Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!" said
she, bowing as she saw him out.
 One, a tall,
fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others.
 His
face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not
been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed
eyes.


Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican
with his chest.


The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
cried wildly: "They're fighting us, lads!"

At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: "Police! Murder!.
.

They've killed a man, lads!"

"Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death--killed!.


"Murderer!" he shouted suddenly to the publican.
 The factory hands and others
followed behind, talking and shouting.
"

On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
crowd.


"Where are all the folks going?"

"Why, to the police, of course!"

"I say, is it true that we have been beaten?" "And what did you think?
Look what folks are saying.


The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his
bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention
to himself.
 It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting
answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.
 Am I not right, good Christians?" said the tall youth, with a
scarcely perceptible smile.
.
.
 We will do, completely do, and undo these
scoundrels.
.
.
.
.
 voices in the rear of the crowd were
suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police
superintendent's trap which drove into the square attended by two
mounted dragoons.


"What people are these?" he shouted again, receiving no answer.
 "Go on!" he ordered
his coachman.
 Do they think we're dogs?" voices in the crowd were heard saying
more and more frequently.
 This letter requested the count to
send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army
was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond Moscow.
 This was not news to
Rostopchin.

One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
finds a justification.
 It is obvious that there would
have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people
if after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became
certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the people
by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all
the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the
population plainly that the town would be abandoned.
 Rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of
relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display
took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do.
 The
inhabitants left against his wishes.
 As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he
knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and
did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.


All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful
and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply
directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
hatred of the French.
 All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no
longer possible to take the whole of it away.
 I had everything ready.
 Those about him had never seen the count
so morose and irritable.
.
.
.
 When lunatics command our armies God evidently means
these other madmen to be free.
"

"Vereshchagin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?" shouted Rostopchin.
 The ship moves
independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer
reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead
of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,
useless, feeble man.
 The tall lad was standing in front,
flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look.
 A drone of voices was
audible through the closed window.


"Is my carriage ready?" asked Rostopchin, stepping back from the window.


"Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your
orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about
treachery.
.
"

"You may go.


He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
 What are your orders about Vereshchagin? He is
waiting at the porch," said the adjutant.


"Good morning, lads!" said the count briskly and loudly.
 I'll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle
with the villain.
 We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
Moscow.
 Wait for me!"

And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
behind him.
 "He'll
settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you said the French.

He'll show you what law is!" the mob were saying as if reproving one
another for their lack of confidence.
 The crowd moved
eagerly from the balcony toward the porch.
 And as he spoke he saw a young man coming
round the corner of the house between two dragoons.

"Put him there.
"

The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed
his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and
submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.
 Only among the back rows of the people, who were
all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling
of feet be heard.
"

The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a
submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him.
 But Rostopchin did
not look at him.
 He looked at the crowd, and rendered more
hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly
and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.
 Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!"
shouted Rostopchin.
 "Cut him down.
 I command it.
"

Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's voice,
the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.


"Count!" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in the
midst of the momentary silence that ensued, "Count! One God is above us
both.
.
.
" shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing
pale like Vereshchagin.
 The tall
youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood
beside Vereshchagin.


But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchagin
he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal.
 The
plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
of the crowd.
 Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that
last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,
carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all.


Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth.
 And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with
which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were
hitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill
him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them
in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
let him go.
.
.
 Traitor, he sold Christ.

Still alive.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
 How not the right one?.


A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in
his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.


"This way, your excellency.
.
.
.
 The
distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there.
 He remembered with
dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
subordinates.
 "The mob is terrible--disgusting," he said to himself
in French.
 This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of
other people.


"Stop! Pull up, I tell you!" he cried in a piercing voice, and again
shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.
 shall rise.

They have torn my body.
.

I need not have said them," he thought.
" He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the
fur-lined coat had turned upon him.
.
 the public
welfare," thought he.
 A man in a general's
uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said something
in French.


"Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told
me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this
would not have happened," he said.
 Rostopchin grew confused and became
silent.
 Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
gaze from Rostopchin's face muttered softly:

"No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!"

Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when
he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
meaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him.






CHAPTER XXVI


Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat's troops were entering
Moscow.
.
 your caps!" These words went from one to another
in the crowd.
 Several French officers superintended the
placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin through field glasses.


The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound
troubled the French.
 Beams and wooden screens had been
put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
an officer and men began to run toward it.
 A general who was standing
by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter
ran back again with his men.


The sound of three more shots came from the gate.

And all made ready for that battle.
 The gate was again hidden by smoke.
 Some of them were sabered and the Kremlin was
purged of their presence.
 No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were
not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
in a camp.
 As soon as the men of the various regiments began
to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost
forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither
citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders.
 Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow
district, not a soldier or officer was left.
 In cellars and storerooms similar men were
busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,
amusing, or caressing women and children.
 There were many such men both
in the shops and houses--but there was no army.
 All around
the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored
and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.
 Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it
had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines.



    * To Rostopchin's ferocious patriotism.
 Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it
is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
in it.


Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.


It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal
power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman
criterion of life.
 Moreover, at this moment Pierre
was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
had already done in that direction.
.
 and then suddenly.
 with pistol or dagger?
But that is all the same! 'It is not I but the hand of Providence that
punishes thee,' I shall say," thought he, imagining what he would say
when killing Napoleon.
 On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but
noticing embarrassment on Pierre's face immediately grew bold and,
staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
 "I say I
won't surrender, I say.


Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, stopped him
in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him.
.
" pleaded Gerasim, trying carefully to steer Makar
Alexeevich by the elbows back to the door.
 Allow me to
have the pistol.
"

"Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?" shouted Makar
Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol.
 When he had advanced
a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good
quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in
a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses.
 "Les francais
sont de bons enfants.



     * "Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good
     fellows.
.
 With
a madman's cunning, Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his
pistol, and took aim.
 Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the
pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there
was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke.


Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,
snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer
and addressed him in French.


"I think not," answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over.


Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to
fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.
 "We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon
traitors," he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
gesture.
 For
a few seconds he looked at him in silence.
 His handsome face assumed a
melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.


For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable.
 Only a Frenchman could
perform a great deed, and to save his life--the life of M.
 Well, and what are we
to do with this man?" he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a
brother.


The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
arm.
 To Pierre's assurances that he
was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone
could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and
said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it
be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude
for saving his life.


"A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito," said the officer, looking
at Pierre's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.


"Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September," he introduced
himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
his mustache.
 I am quite at
your service.
 Monsieur Pierre, you say.
.
"

When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar
and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and
himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,
munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking
his lips, and repeating--"Excellent! Delicious!" His face grew red and
was covered with perspiration.
 Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
with pleasure.
 That beverage was already known
to the French and had been given a special name.
 They called it limonade
de cochon (pig's lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de
cochon he had found in the kitchen.
 But as the captain had the wine they
had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux.
 The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.
"

"I was there," said Pierre.


"Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes.
 "And
you made us pay dear for it.
 I was at it three times--sure as I sit
here.
 "So much
the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle.
.
.

gallant.
 Probably the word "gallant" turned the captain's thoughts to the
state of Moscow.
.
.
.
 He had a habit of stopping short in the
middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.
.


"Oh yes, one sees that plainly.
 A man who doesn't know Paris
is a savage.
.
.
 I assure you
I was his enemy eight years ago.
.
.

When I understood what he wanted--when I saw that he was preparing a bed
of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: 'That is a monarch,' and
I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest
man of the ages past or future.
 This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
not understand what was said to them in French.
 His face expressed suffering.
 He
really was suffering at that moment.
 The
pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready.
 Napoleon was to enter the
town next day.
 He
thought this, but still sat in the same place.
.
 "The German for shelter is Unterkunft.


"Thank you," said Pierre.


"Yes, my dear friend," he began, "such is fortune's caprice.
 I must tell you, mon cher," he continued in the sad and
measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, "that our name
is one of the most ancient in France.


There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
at the officer's handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women.
 The captain was happy, the enchanting
Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: "I have
saved your life, and I save your honor!" Having repeated these words the
captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the
weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.
 Listening
to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before
his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
his love at the Sukharev water tower.
 and there
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.


Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain
asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.


When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he
understood that.
 Speaking thickly and with a faraway
look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his
marriage, Natasha's love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and
all his own simple relations with her.
 The
night was warm and light.


There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense
city.
 And suddenly
remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
against the fence to save himself from falling.
 The next morning
they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
as Great Mytishchi.
 The Rostovs' servants and coachmen and the
orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had
supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.


In a neighboring hut lay Raevski's adjutant with a fractured wrist.
 The
awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his
moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night.


Old Daniel Terentich, the count's valet (as he was called), came up to
the group and shouted at Mishka.


"What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?.
 The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.
.
 The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look.
 She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three
houses off.


"Oh, how terrible," said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and
frightened.
"

And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, she turned
her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident
that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former
attitude.
 You are trembling all over.
 All the way she had sat motionless in a corner
of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the
countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same
way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving.
"

A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only.


"No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor," Natasha replied
irritably and she went to the window and opened it.
 When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.
 "Do lie down," she added crossly,
and buried her face in the pillow.

The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in
the room.
 But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little
Mytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise
of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov's Cossacks had set up across the
street, and the adjutant's unceasing moans could still be heard.
 Natasha did not answer.


Soon after that Natasha heard her mother's even breathing.
 Natasha did
not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,
was growing cold on the bare floor.
 The boards of the floor creaked.
 Stepping cautiously from one
foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
grasped the cold door handle.
 The cold she felt refreshed her.
 With
her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened
the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay.
 But now
that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
see.
 In her
imagination he was that terrible moaning personified.
 But an irresistible impulse drew her forward.


He smiled and held out his hand to her.
 Then he opened them and whispered softly: "And the tea?"
His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished
the doctor.
 Timokhin, the red-nosed major of
Prince Andrew's regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being
taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
Borodino.
 They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his
coachman, and two orderlies.


"I don't want any more.


"I am here, your excellency.


"Couldn't one get a book?" he asked.
"

The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
was feeling.
 Please
get it for me and put it under for a moment," he pleaded in a piteous
voice.
"

"By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!"
said the valet.


The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the
matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at Mytishchi.
 And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again
possessed his soul.
 Everybody near him was sleeping.
 A cricket
chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in
the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on
the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
like a mushroom.
 Every
man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible
only for God.
.
?"

And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew
heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a
soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
"piti-piti-piti," and then "titi," and then again "piti-piti-piti," and
"ti-ti" once more.
 At the same time he felt that above his face, above
the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out
of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.

He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so
that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept
collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
music--"it stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching," said
Prince Andrew to himself.
 Each time the fly touched his
face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his
face where it was rising.
 Now again I feel
that bliss.
 That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I
loved that man.
 Yet how many people have
I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did
her.
" And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha, not as he had done in
the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for
the first time picturing to himself her soul.
.
 In
that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,
something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo
was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but
besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and
a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door.
 Only in the
lower part of it something quivered.


Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.


"Forgive.
 His head was aching, the
clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful
he had done the day before.


"Am I not too late?" he thought.


After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.
 He could not
carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm.
 Besides, it had been
discharged, and he had not had time to reload it.
 The gates of most of the houses
were locked and the shutters up.
 Now and then he met
Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of
the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets.


Pierre shook his head and went on.
 He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
him.


Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskoy.
 He met more people in the streets
and they were more excited.
 The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an
overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his
old nurse's arms.


"Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends.
.
 My daughter!
My youngest daughter is left behind.
.
.
.
 One of its
sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from
the openings of the windows and from under the roof.


Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he
involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around
which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen.
 At first Pierre did not realize
what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing
before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was
going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.
 Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.


"What's he talking about? Get along!" said several voices, and one of
the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from
them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved
threateningly toward him.


"There! There!" shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the
garden at the back of the house.
"

When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled
Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a
three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.
 Besides Russian families who
had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were
several French soldiers in a variety of clothing.
 He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else.
 Pierre
felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly.


Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether
anyone knew where she had gone.


"Why, that must be the Anferovs," said an old deacon, addressing a
pockmarked peasant woman.
 "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!" he added
in his customary bass.


"The Anferovs? No," said the woman.


"O Lord, have mercy!" added the deacon.
 It's she! She kept on lamenting and
crying," continued the woman.

One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round
the waist with a rope.
 He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
bare.
 The other in the frieze gown
stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in
his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.

The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre
caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the
Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to
side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
pockets had seized her by the neck.


The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,
with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
soldier was doing to her.


"Voyons, Pas de betises!" * he cried.



    * "Look here, no nonsense!"


Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
his strength increased tenfold.
 He only remembered beating someone and
being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.
 "All right, you can tell all about it
at the court-martial.
 His
face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in
a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
both sides of Pierre.
 I am your prisoner--take me!" Pierre
suddenly replied in French.


"What does she want?" he murmured.


The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various
streets of Moscow by Durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage,
and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general
opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,
were the cause of the conflagrations.
 The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions
she would be pleased to give--with her characteristic Russian patriotism
had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally
was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.
) The
art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite
independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating
between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell
quite at random on one word and the murmur on another.
 That evening she expected several important personages who
had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused
to a patriotic temper.
"

"Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!"

"They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina.
.
 "We belong to different
camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves.


"I think it is delightful," he said, referring to a diplomatic note that
had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the
French by Wittgenstein, "the hero of Petropol" as he was then called in
Petersburg.
 Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.



"Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass
the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling
of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
pride.
 This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and
zealous champion of old of our country's weal, is offered to Your
Imperial Majesty.
 Next day during the
service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor's birthday, Prince
Volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
Prince Kutuzov.
 Kutuzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a
step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he
was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
information.


Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
joyously festive mood reigned in the city.
 General events involuntarily group themselves around
some particular incident.
 It was like a successfully arranged
surprise.
 Everybody knew
him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting.


Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor's
lack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of Helene.


"I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such
a man.
 You can
yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence
increases my astonishment.



    * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.



The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
on Stone Island.


     * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.
 Michaud's chagrin must have been different from
that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown
into the Emperor's study that the latter at once asked:

"Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?"

"Very sad, sire," replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh.
 He suddenly frowned, as if blaming
himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a
firm voice:

"I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires
great sacrifices of us.
.
 "Would
misfortune make my Russians lose heart?.
 They are burning for the combat," declared this
representative of the Russian nation, "and to prove to Your Majesty by
the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are.
.
"

"Ah!" said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,
he patted Michaud on the shoulder.


"Well, then, go back to the army," he said, drawing himself up to his
full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,
"and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my
beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
my empire.
"

Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly
turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
and went to the further end of his study.
"

And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
 The tales and descriptions of that time
without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,
despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians.
 But it was not really
so.


The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
Russia the less did he realize their significance.


Only a man who has experienced it--that is, has passed some months
continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war--can understand
the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
army's foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals.
 He received
Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)
and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general
progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
so.
 The governor
was a brisk little man, very simple and affable.
 Everything seemed to
him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Voronezh
and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,
everything went well and easily.


There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas' Moscow
acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the
cavalier of St.


As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him
a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words "better late
than never" and heard them repeated several times by others, people
clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once that
he had entered into his proper position in the province--that of a
universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so
after his long privations.
 Among these
was the governor's wife herself, who welcomed Rostov as a near relative
and called him "Nicholas.


All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
 The husband, however, did not seem to share that
conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov.
 Toward the end of the
evening, however, as the wife's face grew more flushed and animated, the
husband's became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there
were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife's
share increased the husband's diminished.


"Which lady?"

"A charming lady, a divine one.
.
 When Rostov approached her she was standing settling up for
the game.


"Do you know, dear boy," began the governor's wife with a serious
expression on her kind little face, "that really would be the match for
you: would you like me to arrange it?"

"Whom do you mean, Aunt?" asked Nicholas.
 What a charming girl she is,
really! And she is not at all so plain, either.
 "As befits
a soldier, Aunt, I don't force myself on anyone or refuse anything," he
said before he had time to consider what he was saying.


"Well then, remember, this is not a joke!"

"Of course not!"

"Yes, yes," the governor's wife said as if talking to herself.
 One is sorry for the husband, really.
.


"But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor's wife!" thought
Nicholas suddenly at supper.
 and Sonya.
.
.


"You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the
very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.


"But Princess Bolkonskaya--that's another matter.
.
"

The governor's wife pressed his elbow gratefully.


"You know Sonya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and
will do so.
.
.
 No, my dear, you and Sonya ought to
understand that.
 How can one think of it!"

"But you don't suppose I'm going to get you married at once? There is
always a right way of doing things," replied the governor's wife.
 She was agitated and
incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,
the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed.
 She was
worried too about her nephew's education for which she had always felt
herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace--a
peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
related to her meeting with Rostov.


The day after her party the governor's wife came to see Malvintseva
and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though
under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be
thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and
could get to know one another.
 First she decided
not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt--that it
would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;
then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then
it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor's wife had intentions
concerning herself and Rostov--their looks and words at times seemed to
confirm this supposition--then she told herself that only she, with
her sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that
situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking
would be an insult to her and to her father's memory.
 With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,
and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
womanly notes vibrated.
 Herself a
consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
man she wished to attract.


Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would
have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that
had taken place in herself.
 For the first
time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had
lived appeared on the surface.


After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on
externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him
and he often thought about her.
 He had pictured each of those young ladies as
almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,
adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:
a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife's carriage,
little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on--and
these pictures of the future had given him pleasure.
 If he tried, his pictures
seemed incongruous and false.
 It made him afraid.
 The conversations he heard
seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs
and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
to him.

When the service was over the governor's wife beckoned him to her.
 It was the same face he had
seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,
spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up.
 There was a
pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it.


"There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess," said Rostov.


"And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound" (the Gazette said
it was a shell) "either proving fatal at once or being very slight,"
continued Nicholas.
.
 When he met her
again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
but powerful.
 But that day's encounter in church had, he
felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind.
 That pale,
sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,
and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
agitated him and evoked his sympathy.
 He tried to picture what would happen were
he free.


"How she prayed!" he thought.
 Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am
sure her prayer will be answered.
 Muddles,
grief for Mamma.
 business difficulties.
 muddles, terrible muddles!
Besides, I don't love her--not as I should.
 O, God! release me from
this dreadful, inextricable position!" he suddenly began to pray.
 "Yes,
prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as
Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into
sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so.

Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not
done for a long time.
 Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
door opened and Lavrushka came in with some papers.
 He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,
and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,
stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.

What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear
him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it
had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he
had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.
 The countess let no occasion slip of
making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya.


But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that
was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead of reproaching and
making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
engagement with Nicholas.


"I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.
 Her
position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it.
 She knew that Natasha
loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him.
 That door opened and Natasha came out, looking excited.
 Not
noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya and took her hand.


As soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by the hand and
went with her into the unoccupied room.
 "Sonya, how happy I am, and how
unhappy!.
.
 because.
 "He will live.


"It's that, that.
" said Sonya, with a white face and trembling lips.


Natasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the window, not
yet understanding what the latter was telling her.
 She not only remembered what she had
then said--that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
something red--but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.


That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among
them) were to be tried for incendiarism.
 As soon as Pierre began to say
anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and
the water could flow to waste.
 Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused
always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were
put to him.
 It was
evident that any answer would lead to conviction.
 Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he "was
protecting a woman," and that "to protect a woman who was being insulted
was the duty of every man; that.


Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant's
house near the Crimean bridge.


These first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were
had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.
" Glancing indolently and
indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge
to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
marshal.
 An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with
thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field.


It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in
place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre
unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been
established over this ruined nest.
 He felt this in the looks of
the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were
escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an
important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,
whom they met on the way.
 Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,
and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with
the others.


They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.


Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of
the room.
 But before he had decided what to do,
Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,
screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.


"You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you.
.
 I am a militia officer and
have not quitted Moscow.


Davout looked up and gazed intently at him.
 He reflected for a moment.
 The only thought in his
mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to
death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him--not
one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it.
 The adjutant, also, had
evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming
in.
 He lost the power of thinking
or understanding.
 He could only hear and see.

Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.


Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
regular tread and halted eight paces from the post.
 The fifth
prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone.
 Pierre did not
understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought
there only to witness the execution.
) The lad was unable to walk.
 When they got
him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.


Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes.
 Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he
wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.
 He only saw how the
workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed
itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally
and one leg bent under him.
 Pierre ran up to the post.
 One of the
soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to
go back.
 But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,
and no one drove him away.
 Pierre was taken
back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post
made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace.
 He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps
forward and back to save himself from falling.
 They
all went away silently and with drooping heads.






CHAPTER XII


After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.


Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
about him interested them greatly.
.
 And he opened
his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.


Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
him every time he moved.


Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully
coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up
at Pierre.
 "So you've come, you rascal? She remembers.
 Now, now,
that'll do!"

And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at
him, returned to his place and sat down.
 In his hands he had something
wrapped in a rag.


"The potatoes are grand!" he said once more.
.
 There were some twenty of us lying there.
 We had
no idea, never guessed at all.


"How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is
Karataev," he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to
address him.


And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed
smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put these
questions.
 "Well, and have you little ones?" he
went on asking.

The great thing is to live in harmony.
.
.
 When Father and we went out mowing
there were seven of us.
 We lived well.
 But if Platon hadn't
been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.
' called us
all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.
 That's how it is, dear fellow.






CHAPTER XIII


Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined
in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for
four weeks.
 His head was quite round,
his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever
ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his
large, gentle brown eyes were also round.
 It was
evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,
and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
irresistible persuasiveness.


His physical strength and agility during the first days of his
imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
sickness meant.
" And
indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he
only had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment's delay for some
work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake.


"A soldier on leave--a shirt outside breeches," he would say.
 Karataev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre
understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
brought him in contact with, particularly with man--not any particular
man, but those with whom he happened to be.
 He loved his dog, his
comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt
that in spite of Karataev's affectionate tenderness for him (by which
he unconsciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he would not have
grieved for a moment at parting from him.
 But to Pierre he always
remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,
eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.
 When he began
to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.
 Latterly she had become convinced that she loved
and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself
in words.


But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that
spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
to give full play to her feeling for her brother.


"I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs are staying
at the merchant Bronnikov's house, in the Square not far from here,
right above the Volga," said the courier.
 On the left there was water--a great
river--and on the right a porch.
 "This way, this way!" said the
girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in
the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to
meet her with a look of emotion.
 This was the countess.
"


 Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the
countess and that it was necessary to say something to her.
 I think you must be tired, Princess.
 She turned
away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when
light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the
door.
.


"How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When
did this happen?" Princess Mary inquired.


"But two days ago this suddenly happened," said Natasha, struggling with
her sobs.


"No, it's not that, but worse.
 As she stepped to the door she already saw in
imagination Andrew's face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,
mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore
affected her very strongly.
 Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in.


He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by
pillows.
 He was thin and pale.
 His eyes gazed at them
as they entered.
.


"How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?" said he in a voice
as calm and aloof as his look.
" *


    * "Thank you for coming, my dear.
"


Princess Mary pressed his hand.
 The pressure made him wince just
perceptibly.


"There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together," said he,
breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha.


Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only
after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it herself.
 It was impossible to talk.


"Why talk of me?" she said quietly and glanced at Natasha.
.
 Is he quite well?"

When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew's room he looked at
his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else
was crying.
" but he broke off.



When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at
the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father.


"Yes, to them it must seem sad!" he thought.



Prince Andrew's little son was seven.
 He understood it
completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up
to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled
and leaning his head against her he began to cry.


When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what
Natasha's face had told her.
 She took turns with her beside his sofa, and
did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that
Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so
evident.
 That inexorable,
eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt
continually all his life--was now near to him and, by the strange
lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable.
 He had twice experienced that terribly
tormenting fear of death--the end--but now he no longer understood that
fear.
 When he came to himself
after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had
instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of
life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to
think about it.


During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he
spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new
principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously
detached himself from earthly life.
 Recalling the
moment at the ambulance station when he had seen Kuragin, he could not
now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question
whether Kuragin was alive.


His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha
referred to when she said: "This suddenly happened," had occurred two
days before Princess Mary arrived.
 Sonya was sitting by the table.
 She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees.
 She
started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand
stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,
and regained her former position.
 Is it possible that the
truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent
my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what
am I to do if I love her?" he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,
from a habit acquired during his sufferings.
.

I want to weep for joy.
"

Natasha drew closer to him.
 Her face shone with rapturous joy.


"Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.


"Why too much?.
.


Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would
not do and that he had to be quiet.
.

He felt himself nearer to it.
 Everything is united by it alone.

Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by
empty witticisms.
 Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to
disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded
all else.
 He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it.
 It
stood behind the door.
 Something not human--death--was
breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out.
 He did not answer and looked at
her strangely, not understanding.
 And compared to the duration of life it did
not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
duration of a dream.
 Both
Princess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this.

Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever
talk to one another about him.
 When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy's
and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and
Natasha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that
was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did
what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
anything else he should do.


"Where has he gone? Where is he now?.
.
"

When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,
everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.

The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and because he was
no more.
.
 Lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army
supplies were for the most part stored along the Oka in the Tula and
Ryazan provinces, and that if they retreated on Nizhni the army would
be separated from its supplies by the broad river Oka, which cannot be
crossed early in winter.
 The army turned more to the south,
along the Ryazan road and nearer to its supplies.






CHAPTER II


The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance
of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually
retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct
course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the
district where supplies were abundant.


The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its
calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov's camp with
overtures for peace.


Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him, though
they were meaningless.



MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general
to discuss several interesting questions with you.
 I beg your Highness
to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the
sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your
person.
 This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le
Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!

NAPOLEON

MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812


Kutuzov replied: "I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as
the initiator of a settlement of any sort.
 These signs were: Lauriston's
mission; the abundance of provisions at Tarutino; the reports coming in
from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of
recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian
soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been
resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,
was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
the French stationed at Tarutino; the news of easy successes gained by
peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;
the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as
the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every
soldier's mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
that the advantage was now on our side.
 Though this plan
had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,
it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.

Kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
difficult to execute.


Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.
 Your last reports
were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has
no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated
farther.
 Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and Tula
with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army, is in danger.
 Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as
the twenty-fifth.
 You will be responsible if the enemy is able to
direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital
in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the
army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have
ample means to avert this fresh calamity.


The Cossack was sent for and questioned.
 I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do
the opposite," replied Bennigsen.


The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermolov was
often to be found.


"No, he's gone out.
 The officer searched till six o'clock in the
evening without even stopping to eat.

Miloradovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a
ball at General Kikin's and that Ermolov was probably there too.
 While still at a
distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance song
proceeding from the house.
 It was already past eight o'clock.


Ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the
officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.



"You think he went off just by chance?" said a comrade, who was on the
staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to
Ermolov.
 "It was a trick.
 It was done on purpose to get Konovnitsyn into
trouble.
"





CHAPTER V


Next day the decrepit Kutuzov, having given orders to be called early,
said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of
having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his caleche
and drove from Letashovka (a village three and a half miles from
Tarutino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet.
 A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning.
 The
officer reported that no order to advance had been received.






CHAPTER VI


Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
and advanced during the night.
 It was an autumn night with dark purple
clouds, but no rain.
 He said that
Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,
and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
capture him alive.


As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before
our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian
attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which
he would lead away heaven only knew where.
 "It will be too late.
 It is quite
light.
 All his men
felt the same excitement.
.
 "Forward, with God's aid!"

"Hurrah-ah-ah!" reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,
trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.
 Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were
taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to
the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like.
 General Bagovut, a fighting
old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,
confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's surprise
and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
to Toll.


"I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as
well as anybody," he said, and advanced with a single division.
 And his division remained under fire for
some time quite uselessly.






CHAPTER VII


Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,
but Kutuzov accompanied that column.
"

Ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.


Soon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully remarked:

"It is not too late yet, your Highness--the enemy has not gone away--if
you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see
a little smoke.


The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov's Cossacks had done:
the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.
 But
people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
or deliberately deceive themselves.


The battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
view--to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
dispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have had in
view--to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying
the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor
the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish
himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and
so on.






CHAPTER VIII


Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there
can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
hands of the French.
 Napoleon's position is most brilliant.


He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his
power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open
to him.


The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon's faculties as having
weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify
his actions.
 But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius
in order to hide our shame.
 Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him
from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it.
 He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.


With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders
to find and execute the incendiaries.
 Its members will be distinguished by a red
ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear
a white belt as well.
 The government has
appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty
commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different
wards of the city.


With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was
placarded everywhere:


PROCLAMATION!

You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom
misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of
the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!
Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in
it.
 (2) Such
supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be
free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him
under any pretense.


With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's arguments as to his
magnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev (whose chief
concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
embassage.


With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being
looted.
 That night the doors were again broken
open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders
perpetrated.


As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
these did not meet with success either.
 The genuine as
well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value.
 Not only was the
paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the
unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.


But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
by the authorities at that time was Napoleon's attempt to stop the
looting and re-establish discipline.
 Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed
more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today.
 Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.
 Very often a wounded animal,
hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter's gun, runs forward and
back again, and hastens its own end.


Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then
at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,
and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
positions, moving his dirty thick big toes.
 And even that ruined and befouled house--which in
dull weather was repulsively ugly--seemed quietly beautiful now, in the
clear, motionless brilliance.


"To be on the march in such weather.
" he began.
 Speak to the captain
when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.
 Thomas,' he said to me the other day.
 He is a Russian seigneur who has
had misfortunes, but he is a man.
.
) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre
talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.


"A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,
ready," said Platon, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.


The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt.
 "You'll be nice and comfortable.
.
 "But give me the pieces that are over.
 The Frenchman
insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
Pierre to translate what he said.
 The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then
looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre's look had told him
something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:

"Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!" And handing back the odd
bits he turned and went out.
"

Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
pieces.
 He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the
dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,
and in romantic love for Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning--and all
these quests and experiments had failed him.


Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important.


"You know, Sokolov, they are not all going away! They have a hospital
here.
 You may be better off than we others," said Pierre.


"O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!" moaned the man in a
louder voice.
 The prisoners
had to be counted before being let out.


But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
moment.


"There it is!.
.
 In the corporal's changed face,
in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the
drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled
people against their will to kill their fellow men--that force the
effect of which he had witnessed during the executions.


When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one
another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed
his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
assured him was ready to do anything for him.
 "Pass on, pass
on!" he continued without looking at Pierre.


"Be so good.
.
 He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco
pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
pipe firmly with the other.
 A third officer, who by his accent
was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was
mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.
.
.


"Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is.
.


At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.
 To the right, where the Kaluga road turns
near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into
the distance.


Davout's troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the
Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga road.
 They advanced the few hundred paces
that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road, taking more than an
hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the
Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge, and the prisoners jammed
close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway.
.
.
.
 See how that fellow has loaded
himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they've even grabbed those
chaises!.
 See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.
 See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It's
like a portable house.
 A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!
Yes, I dare say, that's the way they'll let you pass.
 In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely
squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring
colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.


From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse
smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
ruins of Moscow.


Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.


All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
power.
 They all appeared angry and
dissatisfied.
 For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
be heard from all sides.
 Several
soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the
carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among
themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head
by a sword.
 Once at a standstill they all seemed
to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that
much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.


From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to
their former friendly relations.
 Pierre felt that that fatal force which had
crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his
imprisonment, now again controlled his existence.
 It was terrible, but
he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
of it.


Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
unharnessed cart where there was nobody.
 And he said aloud to himself: "The soldier
did not let me pass.
 They hold me captive.


The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the
red campfires were growing paler and dying down.
 The soldiers and
officers again demanded action.


By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most
difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov--that same
modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up
plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses
on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of
as undecided and undiscerning--but whom we find commanding wherever
the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from
Austerlitz to the year 1813.
 In Smolensk, at the
Malakhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
was awakened by the bombardment of the town--and Smolensk held out all
day long.


It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there to
Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with the French was
fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;
and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that
dubiously.
 And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest testimony to
his merit.


It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
important part.


On the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to Forminsk and
stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing faithfully to execute the
orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive
movement, reached Murat's position apparently in order to give
battle--suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new
Kaluga road and began to enter Forminsk, where only Broussier had
been till then.
 From all these reports it was
evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there
was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected
direction--along the Kaluga road.
 So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.
 "You should
wake the captain first.


"I don't like waking him," he said, fumbling for something.
 Perhaps this is only a rumor.
 You damned rascal, where do you
always hide it?" said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,
to the orderly.

This was Konovnitsyn.


When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, from
the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
running away, and looked at the messenger.


"Who gave the report?" inquired Shcherbinin, taking the envelope.


"The news is reliable," said Bolkhovitinov.
 "Peter Petrovich!" said he.


"Well, what is it? From whom?" he asked immediately but without hurry,
blinking at the light.
 That did not interest him.
 There was within him a deep unexpressed
conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this
and still less speak about it, but must only attend to one's own work.
 He often fell
asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed
without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.


"They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.
 But
that's not what is needed now.

He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that
Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow
awaiting him.
 And the more
he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it.
 All else was to him only life's
customary routine.
 To such customary routine belonged his conversations
with the staff, the letters he wrote from Tarutino to Madame de Stael,
the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence
with Petersburg, and so on.


"Eh, who's there? Come in, come in! What news?" the field marshal called
out to them.


Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
instructions.
 Since the battle of Borodino
and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the
chemical elements of dissolution.
"

The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out early in
the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and
an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
previous and of the impending battle.
 If the
Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very
thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the
Cossacks fell.
 Napoleon
with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his
former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright
the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued
orders--as the historians tell us--to retreat by the Smolensk road.
 To be able to go
a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
end of those thousand miles.
 Their
very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all
their energies.


All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations
in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a
direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
of states and nations increases or decreases.


So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,
and so it is to our own day.
 In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses
its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase.
 To strain the facts to fit the rules of
history: to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the
hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
that destroyed Napoleon's army, is impossible.


The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter
according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
the event.
 In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing
each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by
stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers.
 This was done
by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and
by the Russians in 1812.
 That rule says that an
attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
opponent at the moment of conflict.



For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal
to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.


Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or
divisions, conquer--that is, kill or take captive--all the others, while
themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other
fifteen were lost.
 But this rule which leaves out of
account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.


The French, retreating in 1812--though according to tactics they should
have separated into detachments to defend themselves--congregated into
a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
held the army together.






CHAPTER III


The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into
Smolensk.
 Denis Davydov,
with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of
this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
step toward regularizing this method of warfare.


The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal.
 By October, when
the French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds of such
companies, of various sizes and characters.
 Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,
amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded
and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,
hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued.
 Since early morning he
and his party had been on the move.
 All day long he had been watching
from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of
cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
army, which--as was learned from spies and prisoners--was moving under a
strong escort to Smolensk.
 Two of the commanders
of large parties--one a Pole and the other a German--sent invitations
to Denisov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their
divisions to attack the convoy.


"No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself," said Denisov on reading
these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt
desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo
that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish
general.
 Denisov had two hundred, and
Dolokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not
deter Denisov.
 Like his horse,
which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving
rain and gazed anxiously before him.

Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely
thin.
 In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two
wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had
been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.

It's too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till
another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
from under our noses," thought Denisov, continually peering forward,
hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov.
 But it is not presupposable
that it is the lieutenant colonel himself," said the esaul, who was fond
of using words the Cossacks did not know.


The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later.
.


"Well, I am glad to see you," Denisov interrupted him, and his face
again assumed its anxious expression.


"Michael Feoklitych," said he to the esaul, "this is again fwom that
German, you know.
"

And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
repetition of the German general's demand that he should join forces
with him for an attack on the transport.


"If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch it fwom under our noses," he
added.
.
.
 On reaching a large oak tree that
had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
them with his hand.
 From the spot where the peasant was
standing they could see the French.
 To the right, beyond a steep
ravine, was a small village and a landowner's house with a broken roof.

Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what these and those
of them were.


"It is a very suitable spot," said the esaul.
.
 "We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!
We killed a score or so of 'more-orderers,' but we did no harm else.


Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,
flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude
for partisan warfare.
 At night he would go out for booty and always
brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring
in French captives also.
 When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be
done--to push a cart out of the mud with one's shoulders, pull a horse
out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk
more than thirty miles in a day--everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.


He was the bravest and most useful man in the party.
" But whether because he
had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept
through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
French and, as Denisov had witnessed from above, had been detected by
them.
 He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
stuck in his girdle.
 His wrinkled and pockmarked
face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment.


"Well, where did you disappear to?" inquired Denisov.


"Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why
haven't you taken one?"

"Oh, I took one all right," said Tikhon.
 Then I see he's no good and think I'll go and fetch a
likelier one.
.
.
 They rushed at me with their little swords.
 So I went
for them with my ax, this way: 'What are you up to?' says I.
"

"But I questioned him," said Tikhon.
 "He said he didn't know much.
 He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
a pang in his heart.
 He felt
it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question
the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow's undertaking, that
he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.


The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with the
news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.
 But when dispatching him he recalled
Petya's mad action at the battle of Vyazma, where instead of riding by
the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the
advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired
his pistol.


It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul rode up
to the watchhouse.
 On the
table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.


"So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?" said he to Denisov.
 into the chief.
.
"

Petya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and
flourishing his arms.
.

"Heavens! I was quite forgetting!" he suddenly cried.
 We have a new sutler and
he has such capital things.
 I bought ten pounds.
" and Petya ran out into the passage to
his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
of raisins.
 Or
perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out--that happens
sometimes, you know.
 I bought them very cheap.
.
"

Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped and
blushed.


"I might ask," he thought, "but they'll say: 'He's a boy himself and so
he pities the boy.


"Who do you want, sir?" asked a voice in the darkness.


Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that
day.
 In both
these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched the impression
made by the young lad.
 "We gave him
something to eat a while ago.
 "Oh, what can I do
for him?" he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.


When the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance from
him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him.


Dolokhov's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.
 George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
straight on his head.
 He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of
the room, and without greeting anyone went up to Denisov and began
questioning him about the matter in hand.


"That's so.
"

"I like that!" exclaimed Petya.
"

"Well, you must excuse me, because.
 I shall go, and that's
all.


"He was taken today but he knows nothing.
 I'm keeping him with me.


"Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them," shouted Denisov,
suddenly flushing.


"But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to drop these amenities,"
continued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
this subject which irritated Denisov.
 "Now, why have you kept this lad?"
he went on, swaying his head.
 So isn't it all the
same not to send them?"

The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.
" He paused.



    * "Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?"


"Mot d'ordre," repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.
" cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
at the sentinel.
 "Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.
" *


     * "When an officer is making his round, sentinels don't ask
     him for the password.
.


Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be
heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the
landowner's house.


"Oh, he's a hard nut to crack," said one of the officers who was sitting
in the shadow at the other side of the fire.


"Bonjour, messieurs!" * said Dolokhov loudly and clearly.
 For some seconds all were silent.


"Those brigands are everywhere," replied an officer from behind the
fire.


Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
such as his companion and himself, "but probably they would not dare to
attack large detachments?" he added inquiringly.


Petya wished to say "Good night" but could not utter a word.
 The
officers were whispering together.

"Do you hear?" he asked.


"Well now, good-by.


"Really!" he cried, "you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!
How I love you!"

"All right, all right!" said Dolokhov.
 He was awaiting Petya's return in a state of agitation,
anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.


"Thank God!" he exclaimed.
 We can still get a nap before
morning.
 And then I am used to not
sleeping before a battle.


Petya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.
.
"

And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life
than to act "just anyhow.
"

"Well, you should get some sleep now," said the Cossack.
"

The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
Petya.


"Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately," said Petya.


"Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my
saber for me? It's got bl.
" (Petya feared to tell a lie, and the saber
never had been sharpened.
 He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
edge.
 Fast asleep
after his fright.


Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov's
guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
blotch to the right was the watchman's hut, and the red blotch below to
the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come
for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor
waited to know anything of all this.
 He was in a fairy kingdom where
nothing resembled reality.


Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him.
 The horses neighed and
jostled one another.
" hissed the saber against the whetstone,
and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,
sweetly solemn hymn.
 Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than
Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the
melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
fresh and attractive.
 The music became more and more audible.

Each instrument--now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better
and clearer than violin or horn--played its own part, and before it had
finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into
one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church
music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.
 But perhaps it's music of my own.
 "Oh, this is delightful!
As much as I like and as I like!" said Petya to himself.
 He tried to
conduct that enormous orchestra.
 He was awakened by Likhachev's kindly voice.
 The esaul
gave some orders to his men.
"

The horses were brought.
 His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but
Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,
turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode
up to Denisov.


"Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please.


"I ask one thing of you," he said sternly, "to obey me and not shove
yourself forward anywhere.
"

He did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all the way.
.
 ours!" shouted Petya, and giving rein to his
excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.
 A gallant-looking
Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,
had been defending himself against the hussars.
 When Petya galloped
up the Frenchman had already fallen.
 The French were making
a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.
 Hurrah-ah-ah!" shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment
galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
smoke was thickest.
 The Cossacks saw that his arms and
legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless.


After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house
with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that
they surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay
motionless with outstretched arms.
.
 take them all!" he
recalled Petya's words.
 On the twenty-second of October that party was
no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
Moscow.


Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
captured or left behind.
 Some of Junot's wagons also had been captured
or abandoned.


The group of prisoners had melted away most of all.


The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners
should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.
 When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
Karataev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled
the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre
moved farther away and did not think about him.


He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way.
 He did not
think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
have to share that fate.
 The
dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow.


It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining
harder than before.
 When Pierre reached the fire and
heard Platon's voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face
brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart.
.
 A bloodstained knife
was found under the old merchant's pillow.
 The old man was living as a convict, submitting as
he should and doing no wrong.
 One told how he had taken a life, another had
taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply
been a vagrant and had done nothing.
 Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
killed the other merchant.
 'When,
and in what month?' He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.
 I suffer for my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears.
 The
paper arrived and they began to look for the old man.


And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up
Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.



    * "To your places.
 The convoy formed up.


"What did he say? What did he say?" Pierre heard them ask.
 He made as if he
did not notice that look and moved hastily away.
 Karataev
was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
Frenchmen were talking over his head.






CHAPTER XV


The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal's baggage train stopped at
the village of Shamshevo.
 The men crowded together round the campfires.
 He again slept as he had
done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino.


Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,
gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had
been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.
 Life is God.
 And while there is life there is joy in consciousness
of the divine.
 This globe was alive--a
vibrating ball without fixed dimensions.
 Its whole surface consisted of
drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed
places, sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one
dividing into many.


"That is life," said the old teacher.
 And it grows, merges, disappears from the
surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges.
 Do you understand, my child?" said the
teacher.
 A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian
soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece
of meat stuck on a ramrod.
 And
without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion
from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in
summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating
globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.
 All
around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.


"Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!" old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as
they embraced Cossacks and hussars.
 Pierre sobbed as he sat
among them and could not utter a word.
 He hugged the first soldier who
approached him, and kissed him, weeping.



    * "Get along, get along!"


Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks
who were carrying the body of Petya Rostov to a hole that had been dug
in the garden.
 The French army melted
away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma
to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and from the Berezina to
Vilna--independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold,
the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.

Beyond Vyazma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled
together into one mass, and so went on to the end.
 Scarcely a quarter
of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others
go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
escape discipline.
 But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote
commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another
sire, mon cousin, prince d'Eckmuhl, roi de Naples, and so on.


Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit
and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means
of approximately ascertaining the enemy's position--by cavalry
scouting--was not available.
 But after a four days' halt the mob, with no
maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
to the right nor to the left but along the old--the worst--road, through
Krasnoe and Orsha.






CHAPTER XVIII


This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did
all they could to destroy themselves.
 Even that final running away, described in
ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child
is taught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the
historians' language.


"C'est grand!" * say the historians, and there no longer exists either
good or evil but only "grand" and "not grand.


The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for
Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.


But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French
victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series
of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
liberation of their country.


The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,
from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this
last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.
 The only thing to be said
in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry.


Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term "to cut off" has no
meaning.
 One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army.
 Men can only be taken
prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
tactics, as the Germans did.
 But the French troops quite rightly did not
consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited
them in flight or captivity alike.


All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.


To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and so do their
surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
their investigation.
 And the
experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face.

Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to
dinner, the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any
word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully
irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which
they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those
mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
them.


Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.
 Still more carefully did
they avoid anything relating to him who was dead.

Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to
be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
for the first fortnight.
 Hard as it was for Princess
Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she
had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
Natasha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
involuntarily yielded to them.


After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,
Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled
up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting
something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on.


She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
on which--with a terrible questioning too great for her strength--her
spiritual gaze was fixed.


One day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, dressed in a
black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was
crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and
smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
door.


She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and
sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.
" And he looked searchingly
at her.
 Natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what
she would say.
 She said: "This can't go on--it won't.
 You will get
well--quite well.
 She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
gaze.
.
" And
now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her
imagination Natasha this time gave him a different answer.
 And in her
imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
said then but only spoke now: "I love thee!.
 thee! I love, love.
.
.
"
she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
desperate effort.


She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.






CHAPTER II


Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was feeling
a special estrangement from the members of her own family.
 He
had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
choking him.
 When he saw Natasha he waved his arms despairingly and
burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.
.
 is calling.
" cried the countess.
.


Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the
next day and night.
 The countess was
sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
 "You have improved in looks and grown more
manly," continued the countess, taking her daughter's hand.
 For three weeks Natasha
remained constantly at her mother's side, sleeping on a lounge chair
in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly
because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her
mother.


Natasha's wound healed in that way.
 The last weeks passed in her mother's bedroom
had strained Natasha's physical strength.


One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took
her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed.
 Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.
 But how? What is her mind like? What
does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!"

"Mary," she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary's hand to herself,
"Mary, you mustn't think me wicked.
 A
feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive
feeling of life being possible only in each other's presence.


One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.


Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, so she called
again--though she could hear Dunyasha coming--called her in the deep
chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively
to herself.
 The wound had begun to heal
from within.


At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count
insisted on Natasha's going with her to consult the doctors.


To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only
necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not
losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and
less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a
hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty thousand.
 The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon's army was
the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
corresponding decrease of the Russian army.
 Only by following
at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French.
 Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
soldiers--ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved--who within a
month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the
frontier.


Toll wrote a disposition: "The first column will march to so and so,"
etc.


And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented
to them--that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
frost-bitten, and starving--and the column that had been presented to
them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to
do.


These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the
most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and
imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
deed.



Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind
does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals
who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to
it.
 He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de
Stael, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with
generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried
to prove anything to him.
 What did it matter to him--who then alone amid a senseless
crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
happening--what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed the
calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to
him who was appointed chief of the artillery.

Beginning with the battle of Borodino, from which time his disagreement
with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodino
was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches
and reports up to the time of his death.


Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
events.
 His actions--without the smallest deviation--were all directed
to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for
conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out
of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
and of our army.
 And only that feeling placed him on that highest human
pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers
not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
them.


To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of
greatness.






CHAPTER VI


The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of
Krasnoe.
 He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially
wretched appearance.


One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of
whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw
flesh with their hands.


Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers.


"Ah, the standards!" said Kutuzov, evidently detaching himself with
difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.
 He looked
attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of
them.
 In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
distinctly heard.
 "I thank you all for your hard and faithful service.
 "Lower, lower, that's it.
 Hurrah lads!" he added, addressing
the men with a rapid movement of his chin.
 It was no longer
the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
tell his comrades something very important.
 The Tsar won't forget your service.

While they were strong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we may even
pity them.


The commander rode up to his hut.
 A third
section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and
dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the
campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.


"Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That's it.
.
.
 With a song!"

All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing.
 All together! Heave away,
boys!.
.
.
.


"What are you up to?" suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.


The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,
and a campfire was built before it.
 All the physically or morally weak had long since been
left behind and only the flower of the army--physically and
mentally--remained.


More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than
anywhere else.
 Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
campfire blazed brighter than others.


This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being
robust he ordered about those weaker than himself.
 It's well that I'm a
musketeer.
 They were clearing the hut for the
colonel and carried them out.
"

"But they're a clean folk, lads," the first man went on; "he was
white--as white as birchbark--and some of them are such fine fellows,
you might think they were nobles.


"You're a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot.
 'But,' he
says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty.
 So,' he says,
'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
them off: we can hardly do it.


"It must be from their food," said the sergeant major.
"

No one contradicted him.
 It's wonderful how they shine! You would think the
women had spread out their linen," said one of the men, gazing with
admiration at the Milky Way.


"That's a sign of a good harvest next year.
"

"You warm your back and your belly gets frozen.


"They're having such fun," said he, coming back.
 He's
singing songs.
"

And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.
 They came up
to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
not understand.


The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head
wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.


Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by
the soldiers.


"Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!" sang Morel, winking.
.


"Well, go on, go on!"

    "Qui eut le triple talent,
    De boire, de battre,
    Et d'etre un vert galant.
" *


      * Who had a triple talent
      For drinking, for fighting,
      And for being a gallant old boy.


"Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?"

"Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after
starving.

The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one
would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a
smile.
 "Even wormwood grows on its own root.
"

"O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard
frost.
 The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking
at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring
up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something
gladsome and mysterious to one another.
 This was shown not so much by the arrangements it
made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges.
 The French did not need to be informed of the fact
that half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not know what to
do--perished of cold and hunger despite their captors' desire to save
them; they felt that it could not be otherwise.

The French perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was
itself exposed.


Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that
it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the
profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which
they thought were mere phrases) about a "golden bridge," about the
impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,
and so forth.
 Twice during his career Kutuzov had been governor of
Vilna.
 In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old
friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had
so long been deprived.


Chichagov, one of the most zealous "cutters-off" and "breakers-up," who
had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but
never wished to go where he was sent: Chichagov, noted for the boldness
with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be
under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace
with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutuzov, and found that peace had
already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of
securing that peace was really Kutuzov's; this Chichagov was the first
to meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay.


"You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.
.
 On the
contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give
dinner parties," warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word he
spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov to be
animated by the same desire.


Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite--Count
Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others--the Emperor reached
Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to
the castle.
 He put on his hat with its peaks to the
sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the
report he had prepared for the Emperor.


There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew
furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh
in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be
descried.
 Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark.
 Everyone spoke loudly of the field
marshal's great weakness and failing health.
 And in fact his health was poor.


The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another
leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from
Kutuzov's and animated by different motives.


Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or
Napoleon meant.
 After his liberation he reached Orel, and on the third
day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up
for three months.
 He had what the doctors termed "bilious fever.
 All this at
the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its
significance.
 But for a long time in
his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity.
 Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself.
 That search for
an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity
he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere.
 All his life
he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have
merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.


In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
infinite something.
 In everything near and comprehensible he had only
what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless.
 In appearance he
was just what he used to be.
 As before he was absent-minded and seemed
occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special
of his own.


Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and
seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and
knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
secrets.
 Formerly she had felt
that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into
herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards
gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.
 Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in
finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,
hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.


"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of
bad people but of people such as myself," thought she.
" Terenty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good
night, often lingered with his master's boots in his hands and clothes
over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk.


This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of
the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.


"If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
such a nation," he said to Pierre.


But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much
behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into
apathy and egotism.
 Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests
continually absorbed his attention.


In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center
of gravity he had previously lacked.


Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
perplexity about these questions.
 There was now within him a judge who
by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.


His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up with him his
diminished income.
"

But in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the
state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this
as of a settled matter.
 About the same time he received letters from
Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife's
debts.
 And Pierre decided that the steward's proposals which had so
pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his
wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow.
 Throughout his journey he felt like
a schoolboy on holiday.
 Everyone--the stagecoach driver, the post-house
overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages--had a
new significance for him.






CHAPTER XIV


It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap
has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of
rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they
jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally
difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the
French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow.
 All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and
indestructible.


The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode's
detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had
fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity.
 They
continued what the French had begun.
 There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,
market stalls, granaries--for the most part still stocked with
goods--and there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy
houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices,
churches, and cathedrals.
 The owners of houses in which much
property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of
the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin;
others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different
houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to
keep all that was found there.
 And Count Rostopchin
wrote proclamations.
 Everybody was celebrating the victory,
everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.
 He felt himself not only free from social
obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had
aroused in himself.
 The death, sufferings, and last days of
Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's thoughts and now recurred to
him with fresh vividness.
 He recalled Karataev and his death and
involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so
similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
felt for both of them.
"

A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought
word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he
would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.
 "This must be one of her companions," he
thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.


"I was so glad to hear of your safety.
 "I thought he had
been killed.
 I only know
that he fell in with the Rostovs.
.
 He glanced once at the
companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,
as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion
in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not
hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.
 It merely reminds me of her.

He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress.
 He
became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
saying.
 She had grown thin and pale, but
that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the
moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and
glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes
were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.






CHAPTER XVI


"She has come to stay with me," said Princess Mary.


"How can you ask why?" said Princess Mary.
.
 yours.


"Yes, yes, and so.
 so he
grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought one
thing--to be perfectly good--so he could not be afraid of death.
.
 "And
he.
 he.
.
.
.
 I
had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was
to see him and be with him," she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.


And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
never yet mentioned to anyone--all she had lived through during those
three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.


Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
tears.
 As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,
nor of what she was telling.


"No, Natasha and I sometimes don't go to sleep till after two, so please
don't go.
 I will order supper.
"

Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: "This is the first
time she has talked of him like that.
"





CHAPTER XVII


Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes
later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Natasha.
 Natasha
was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
face.
 It is
impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is
awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
affectation.
 They went silently to table.
 Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess
Mary.
 "Now tell us about yourself,"
said she.
 Is that true?"

"But I am three times as rich as before," returned Pierre.
 And then such a death.


"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor," said Princess
Mary.


Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look
at Natasha.
 When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,
stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.


Pierre laughed.


"But it's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?" Natasha
asked with a slight smile.


Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at
Natasha.

Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly
changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never
wandered--evidently herself experiencing all that he described.
.
.
 When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass
over the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he should not omit
anything.
 "Where is he?"

"They killed him almost before my eyes.


It was three o'clock in the morning.
 Princess Mary was silent.
 It
occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and time to go to
bed.
 "I too should
wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.
"

Pierre looked intently at her.
 "I am not to blame for being
alive and wishing to live--nor you either.
.
 Papa used to.
.


"Yes, and yet he is quite different.
 Really he is quite unlike
him--in everything.


A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the
Friday.
"

"But what about my heirs?" said Pierre.


"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.
.
 You must forgive
the trouble I have put you to," said Pierre, and seeing Savelich smile,
he thought: "But how strange it is that he should not know that now
there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of
all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending.


"I have seen the princess," she replied.
 "I heard that they were
arranging a match for her with young Rostov.
 It would be a very good
thing for the Rostovs, they are said to be utterly ruined.
 Fancy
bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest
and takes bribes.
" But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom.
 Though
Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
though all Pierre's interest was now centered in that house, by the
evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off.
.
 I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,"
said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking
his departure.
 The weariness she
had plainly shown before had now quite passed off.
 With a deep and
long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.


When Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion and awkwardness
immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement.
 "Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my
dear friend, listen! I know it all.
 But I want to be a brother to
her.
 No, not that, I don't, I can't.
.
 that possibility.
 You are right that to speak to her of love at
present.
 She was going to say that to speak of love was
impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change
in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre
spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.


"To speak to her now wouldn't do," said the princess all the same.


"Well?.
 Well?.


Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
expression seized Princess Mary's hand.


"Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure
of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one
day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?.
.


And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which
accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre.
 "'I shall
look forward very much to your return.
.
' Yes, yes, how did she say it?
Yes, 'I shall look forward very much to your return.
' Oh, how happy I
am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!" said Pierre to himself.
.
? I am something altogether different and higher.
 He did not now make any
plans.
 But at this time he saw everybody--both
those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that
is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not
understand it--in the bright light of the emotion that shone within
himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
everything that was good and worthy of being loved.


Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity.
 On the contrary I was then wiser and had
more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth
understanding in life, because.
 From that evening she seemed to have
forgotten all that had happened to her.
"

Understandable and touching as the look with which Natasha gazed at
her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,
these words pained her for a moment.
 On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha was
astounded.


"Mary," said she, "tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.
.


"But why go to Petersburg?" Natasha suddenly asked, and hastily replied
to her own question.
 But the
mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of
their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.
 It was seething in its depths.
 Let
us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,
and that Alexander had acted on it.
 If the aim was the
dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that
much better than warfare.
 If the aim was the progress of civilization,
it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.


By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is
impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and
Alexander with all their antecedents.

The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.
 And by chance an escape from this dangerous position
presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition
to Africa.
 Impregnable Malta
surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with
success.
 And the
men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves
that this is admirable, this is glory--it resembles Caesar and Alexander
the Great and is therefore good.
 The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
imputed to him as a fault.

Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he
never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and
the Austrians, who surrender without a battle.


As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the
western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,
and 1809, gaining strength and growing.
 During
the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
the crowned heads of Europe.
 One after another they hasten to display their
insignificance before him.
 The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek
the great man's mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that
this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the
guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the
aggrandizement of the great man.
 It is not Napoleon who prepares himself
for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who
prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
happening and has to happen.
 Not only is he
great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his
brothers-in-law.


The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Moscow.
 That
city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram.

Attempted drives from east to west--similar to the contrary movements of
1805, 1807, and 1809--precede the great westward movement; there is the
same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion
of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation
midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.


Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached.
 Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his
craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
years previously and one year later--an outlawed brigand.
 His part is not yet ended.


But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed.
 The last backwash of the movement from the west
occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
history.
 And the child is afraid
of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people.
 A poet admires the
bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
fragrance of flowers.

Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely
says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear
a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race.
 But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,
the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern.


All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
other manifestations of life.


The arrangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a while.
 He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite
the doctor's encouragement.
 After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and
next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
to the deceased filled the house rented by the Rostovs.
.
 Having borrowed money from his
brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.

His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and Sonya,
but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty.
 She had all that people
are valued for, but little that could have made him love her.


Nicholas' position became worse and worse.
 The other way out--his mother's
death--never entered his head.
 He tried
to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and
even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently
up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another.






CHAPTER VI


At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow.
 Remembering her friendly
relations with all the Rostovs which had made her almost a member of the
family, she thought it her duty to go to see them.
 Making
a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
arrival in Moscow.


Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room could only be
reached through his.


Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,
but his silence irritated her.
 One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.


The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the
day after that.
 Though she had
firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole
matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position.
 His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling
for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could
discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at
ease.


One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
nephew's lessons, she was informed that Rostov had called.
 With a firm
resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent
for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.
 He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
think of nothing to say.


"Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, "it doesn't
seem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo, but how much water
has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet
I would give much to bring back that time.
.
.
.
.
"

His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression.
.
.
 I divined his noble, resolute,
self-sacrificing spirit too," she said to herself.
.
.
 Yes, that's the only reason.
.
.
 I confess it.
 For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
friendship.


Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
selling any of his wife's property, and having received a small
inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.
 He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,
and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any
particular part of the work on his estate.
 When Nicholas first began farming
and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who
especially attracted his attention.
 The peasant seemed to him not merely
a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself.
 Before
analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and
credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the
peasants had and increased the number by all possible means.
 He was hard alike
on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled
from the commune.


He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the "drones"
as he called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity.


Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would
say: "What can one do with our Russian peasants?" and imagined that he
could not bear them.
"

Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to
anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought
him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her
to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately
refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
business.
 She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and
which had laws she had not fathomed.
 And to do that,
order and strictness are essential.
.
.
 At first he saw nothing reprehensible in
this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
punishment suddenly changed.


The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
and began to cry.


"Nicholas, I saw it.
.
.
 Nicholas!" and
she covered her face with her hands.


"Mary," he said softly, going up to her, "it will never happen again;
I give you my word.
 Oh, Mary, don't remind me of it!" and
again he flushed.
 The
whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work
on his farm.


Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and about her
own injustice toward her.


"You know," said Natasha, "you have read the Gospels a great deal--there
is a passage in them that just fits Sonya.
' You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don't know.

Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had
a sort of presentiment that it would not come off.
 It really seemed that Sonya did not feel her position
trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.

She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
whole.
 It had bare deal floors and was furnished with
very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own
serf carpenters out of their own birchwood.


On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of
visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for
a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to
the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to
congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections
of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve
of that day in his usual way.


"Then I'm not mistaken," thought Countess Mary.


"Well, messieurs et mesdames," said Nicholas loudly and with apparent
cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to
vex her), "I have been on my feet since six this morning.
 "He talks to everyone
except me.
.
" She looked down at her expanded figure and in the
glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
larger than ever.


Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.
 Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,
followed her on tiptoe.
 He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to
Countess Mary.
 She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked.
.
"

Nicholas coughed and said no more.
 "Papa wants to sleep.


"May I kiss Mamma?" he asked Natasha.
.
.
.
.

and now.
.
.
"

"Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it's love that
makes us see beauty.
 A
thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also.
 Her thoughts were about the children.
 "You reproach us women with being illogical.
 Here is our
logic.


"Yes, yes.
 There was an expression of carefree happiness
on the faces of both father and daughter.
.
"

At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.
"

"I am sure it is Pierre.
 His capers reminded
him of dancing, and looking at the child's round happy little face he
thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her
into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.

Well, come along now, quick, quick! It's time you two were parted," she
added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.


Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
 A smile lit up her face but at the same time she
sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she
felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness
unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
instant.

Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was
not visible at all.
 At the rare moments when the old fire
did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more
attractive than in former days.
 She acted in contradiction
to all those rules.
 She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of
her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
entirely--that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden
from him.


We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in
a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so
trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire
attention is devoted to it.


Natasha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the
society of her relatives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother,
and Sonya.
 His wife's demands astonished him, but they also
flattered him, and he submitted to them.
 He had only to
express a wish and Natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it.


The entire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed orders,
that is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess.


It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and
delight would find in his wife's ideas and actions the very thought
against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous
that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
opinion.
 But only what was really good in
him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.

And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
mysterious reflection.






CHAPTER XI


Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostovs
he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come
to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal
founders.


On reading that letter (she always read her husband's letters) Natasha
herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel
his absence very acutely.


Denisov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight.
 He
looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
person once dear.


"It's all nonsense, all rubbish--those discussions which lead to nothing
and all those idiotic societies!" Natasha declared of the very affairs
in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.


And she would go to the nursery to nurse Petya, her only boy.
.
" and
that was unanswerable.
 While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
husband more easily.


She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre's sleigh was heard
at the front door, and the old nurse--knowing how to please her
mistress--entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
face.


"Has he come?" Natasha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest
she should rouse the dozing baby.


The blood rushed to Natasha's face and her feet involuntarily moved, but
she could not jump up and run out.
 But at the
door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in
her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round.
 "Yes, it is he, happy and contented.
"

Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
reproaches and angry words.
.
 He wanted
to smile but dared not even think of doing so.
 He made a piteous,
frightened face and bent down.
"

"You see, he holds it up.
.
 Pierre with the baby
on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries.
 But
in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby
with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
attention.
 Come along, Pierre!"

"And yet he's such an affectionate father," said Countess Mary,
vindicating her husband, "but only after they are a year old or so.
.
"

"Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly," said Natasha.
" Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and
shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.
 Every
event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all
these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
over that occurrence independently of the others.
 Countess Mary who had brought him up
had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and
little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of
contempt.
 He did not want to be an hussar or
a Knight of St.


From broken remarks about Natasha and his father, from the emotion with
which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent
tenderness with which Natasha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just
beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had
loved Natasha and when dying had left her to his friend.


The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were
pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
and peacefully.


Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
haste to satisfy all their expectations.


Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no
longer his nor did he wish for it.
 He felt that his way of life had now
been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
his power, and so that way of life proved economical.


"What do you think of this?" said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a
shopman.

"It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?"

Pierre told her the price.
 Well, let's go now.


The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a
frill that surrounded her face.
 Life gave her no new impressions.
 A peculiarity one sees in very young children
and very old people was particularly evident in her.


Thus in the morning--especially if she had eaten anything rich the day
before--she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
pretext Belova's deafness.


And when Belova replied: "Oh yes, they've come," she would mutter
angrily: "O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!"

Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp
or not rubbed fine enough.
 Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile
between Nicholas, Pierre, Natasha, and Countess Mary was the common
understanding of her condition expressed.
 "Memento
mori," said these glances.
"--yet it was evident that she was
not pleased by Pierre's arrival at that moment when it diverted her
attention from the unfinished game.
 Doesn't see
anything, doesn't remember anything," she went on, repeating her usual
phrases.
 "Look, Anna Timofeevna," she added to her companion, "see what
a box for cards my son has brought us!"

Belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.
 But to the old countess those contemporaries
of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society.
 Denisov,
not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierre's caution
and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in
Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in
the Semenovsk regiment, then about Arakcheev, and then about the Bible
Society.
 "Is
that weally still going on?"

"Going on?" Pierre exclaimed.


"It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her stocking," said Countess
Mary.
 You stand here, and you in my arms--well now! One,
two!.
 Dessalles whispered to the
boy to come downstairs.


"No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay," replied
Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper.


"I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles.


The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,
in which most people see the chief interest of home politics.
 Denisov,
dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg
which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what
Pierre told them.


But Natasha, knowing all her husband's ways and ideas, saw that he had
long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince
Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince
Theodore had gone.


"What was it about?" asked Nicholas.


"Always the same thing," said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.
 The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolkonski
followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
in a shady corner by the window.


"Well, what would you do?" asked Denisov.


"Always some fantastic schemes," said Nicholas.
 He
has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism" (Pierre could not
tolerate mysticism in anyone now).
.
 Everything is
strained to such a degree that it will certainly break," said Pierre (as
those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
governments began).

When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as
possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
calamity.
 The society need not be secret if the
government allows it.
 It is only to prevent some Pugachev or other from
killing my children and yours, and Arakcheev from sending me off to some
Military Settlement.
"

Natasha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at her
husband.
 That's all wight.
 Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties
were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered.


"I will tell you this," he said, rising and trying with nervously
twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
abandoning the attempt.
 The conversation was resumed, and
no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas' last remark.


When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkonski went
up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.
.
.
 would he agree with
you?" he asked.
.


Nicholas started angrily.

Denisov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing
about them.
 The family separated on the most friendly terms.


"What are you writing, Mary?" Nicholas asked.
 Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not
wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me.
 For a long time
he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in
his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.

Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began
crying piteously and kissing me.


Under the date "5" was entered:


Mitya was naughty at table.
 Had Nicholas
been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,
tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,
in which she had her being.
 Have you any idea
why he went to Petersburg? They have formed.
"

"Well, then, you know," Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere
recollection of their discussion, "he wanted to convince me that it is
every honest man's duty to go against the government, and that the oath
of allegiance and duty.
.
 They all fell
on me--Denisov and Natasha.
" added Nicholas, yielding to that
irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
dearest to us.


"When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he
started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there--what
would you have said?"

"As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natasha so.
 "He is such an exceptional boy.
 I am afraid I
neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while
he has no one.
 All that
the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
him, and of course I am glad of it.
 Next summer I'll take him to Petersburg,"
said Nicholas.
 "Well, what business is it of mine what goes on
there--whether Arakcheev is bad, and all that? What business was it of
mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with
prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And
then there are you and the children and our affairs.
"

Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
and that he attached too much importance to these matters.


"You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofanych" (this was his overseer) "came
back from the Tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty
thousand rubles for the forest.
 Besides this
feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
the details of her husband's plans, thoughts that had no connection with
what he was saying flitted through her mind.
 She did not compare them with him, but
compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
Nicholas.
 In saying this Natasha was sincere in acknowledging Mary's
superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all
other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in
Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.
"

Natasha looked intently at him and went on:

"Mary is so splendid," she said.


Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's likeness to Nicholas: the
recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
he wanted to know what Natasha thought of it.
.
 When I am taken up by a thought, all else is
mere amusement.
 "Nicholas
says we ought not to think.
"

Natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre's idea,
but one thing disconcerted her.
 "About Platon
Karataev.


"Platon Karataev?" he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely
trying to imagine Karataev's opinion on the subject.
 yet perhaps he would.
.
.
" Natasha began.
 Yes, of course-" he did not
finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.
 If only you did not go away! Do you remember how
we quarreled? And it was always my fault.
 And what we
quarreled about--I don't even remember!"

"Always about the same thing," said Pierre with a smile.
 "Jealo.


"No, and if I had I shouldn't have recognized her.
.


"No.


"I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
simple ones.
 "I only wanted to tell you about Petya: today nurse was coming
to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me.
 I'm
sure he thought he was hiding.
 Little Nicholas, who had
just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him
with wide-open eyes.
 "I loved you, but I have orders from Arakcheev and will kill
the first of you who moves forward.
 But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them.
 Terror
seized young Nicholas and he awoke.


"My father!" he thought.
 (Though there were two good portraits of Prince
Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.
 Whatever he may tell me, I will do it.
 Mucius Scaevola burned
his hand.
 Everyone shall know me, love me,
and be delighted with me!" And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
he began to cry.

"But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,
Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be
satisfied.
 To seize and put into
words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
nation, appears impossible.


For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
participation of the Deity in human affairs.


Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various
kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses.


Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has
obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine
authority of the kings and the "fate" of the ancients, to reach the same
conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided
by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these
nations and humanity at large are tending.


If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and
directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply,
would have been clear and complete.
 Moreover, certain
men wrote some books at that time.
 This caused people all over France to begin
to slash at and drown one another.
 All Napoleon's allies suddenly
became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
raised.
 The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to
abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the
title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before
and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.


If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
humanity and of the peoples, the first question--in the absence of a
reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible--is: what is the
power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies
either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very
proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.


All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not
what was asked.
 The answers given by this kind
of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
 So the historians
of this class, by mutually destroying one another's positions, destroy
the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
reply to history's essential question.
 Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one
time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of
1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon's
misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
development by Napoleon's caprice.


To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the
sum of the components must equal the resultant.

Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such
a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is
natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar
belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers
(if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers
do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,
civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions
under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
theory.
 A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
the smoke which the wind carries away.


The peasant is irrefutable.


The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.


This conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who
breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method
of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one
possible way of dealing with it.
 The necessity of the conception of
power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by
the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they
professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
every step.
 But just as doubts of the real
value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much
of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also
doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?--that is, wants
to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
comprehension.
 As gold is
gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,
so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
history's essential question: what is power? The universal historians
give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of
culture evade it and answer something quite different.


If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
elsewhere--in the relation to the people of the man who wields the
power.


From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
power--existing immutably outside time--is, but to history's questions
about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
nothing.
 But what this program
consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually
contradict one another.
 But not
to mention the historians' contradictions as to the nature of this
program--or even admitting that some one general program of these
conditions exists--the facts of history almost always contradict that
theory.


But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
leaders serves as an expression of the people's will or only some part
of it.
 The most usual generalizations adopted by almost
all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,
civilization, and culture.
 Postulating some generalization as the goal
of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the
greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,
authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in
their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.
 We learn that Luther had
a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after
the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the
French Revolution they guillotined one another.


Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the
theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
the collective will was transferred to him.
 (With this method
of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the
direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the
people's change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,
or even in the rear.
)

"If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow
a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd
we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
sides of the herd.
 That
is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which
we do not understand.
 Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters
Russia.


Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
cannot regard "power" as the cause of events.


Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no
command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
rendering the execution of the last command possible.


For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should
order what can be executed.
 Apart from that, the chief source
of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such
for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is
generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole
series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.
 Amid a long series
of unexecuted orders of Napoleon's one series, for the campaign of 1812,
was carried out--not because those orders differed in any way from the
other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work
this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over
the figure cut in the stencil.


The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of
the cone and its base.
 The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,
burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions
from men above him; he himself never gives an order.
 The commander in chief
never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general
orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops.
 A similar
relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
for common activity--in agriculture, trade, and every administration.


This relation of the men who command to those they command is what
constitutes the essence of the conception called power.


Men are hauling a log.
 The man who worked most with his hands could not
think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what
would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded
more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
verbal activity.
 And corresponding to the event its justification appears in
people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for
liberty, and for equality.


In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts
will always be noticeable ahead of it.


We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that
occurs--the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the
essential connection of historical persons with the masses.



Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed
that the events depended on those commands.
 But examining the events
themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
events.


Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
these two essential questions of history:

(1) What is power?

(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?

(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,
in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
his participation in that action.
 Electricity produces heat, heat produces
electricity.
 Why war and revolution occur we do
not know.






CHAPTER VIII


If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this
simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
argument.


The presence of the problem of man's free will, though unexpressed, is
felt at every step of history.


If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he
pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.


If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot
exist, for then man's will is subject to that law.


In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most
ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.


The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation
from whatever point of view--theological, historical, ethical, or
philosophic--we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all
that exists) is subject.
 Were it not free it could not be limited.
 A man's will seems to him
to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.


Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of
knowledge--thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the
diffusion of printed matter--has the question of the freedom of will
been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist.






CHAPTER IX


For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history
has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer
to the essence of man's free will but its manifestation in the past and
under certain conditions.


The subject for history is not man's will itself but our presentation of
it.


To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and
what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy
of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
sciences.
 Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life
under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the
conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
dependent on these two elements.
 In every action we examine we see a certain measure of
freedom and a certain measure of inevitability.
 Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who
considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
examined it the day after it was committed.
 And in the same way every
action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less
free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one
who does not know it.


The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man's
relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness
of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man
in relation to everything coexisting with him.


In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning
the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity.
 But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared
as merely due to the will of certain people.
 But if even one of
the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,
or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom
of the apparently original action.
 The founder of a
sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by
what the way was prepared for his activity.
 If we have a large range
of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
correlation of cause and effect in people's actions, their actions
appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
connect the effects with the causes.

If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage
of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton--then,
knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so
little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
we can foretell the result.
 To
conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is
evidently impossible.


(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time.
 The
moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that
moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made
would be the only one.
 That I did not lift my arm a moment later does
not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then.


We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man's
whole outlook on the universe is constructed--the incomprehensible
essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.
 Consciousness
gives expression to the essence of freedom.
 Inevitability is what examines.
 Inevitability is the form.


All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of
life to the laws of reason.


All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
laws of reason.


The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more
evident are the laws of that movement.


From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in
man's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,
for however man's free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize
it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes
impossible.
 Abandoning the conception
of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all
unknown, infinitely small, elements.
 The same is done by
the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for
laws.
 And if history has for its object
the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting
aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the
inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.


From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that
mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce
migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built
were destroyed in their essence.
 For if a
certain mode of government was established or certain migrations
of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,
ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those
individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.


And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,
and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.
 But as in astronomy the new view said: "It is true that we
do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility
we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not
feel) we arrive at laws," so also in history the new view says: "It is
true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our
free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on
the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.
