 But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more
to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful
slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened
you--sit down and tell me all the news.
 Petersburg, used only by the
elite.


All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered
by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette
Scherer.
 He had just entered, wearing an
embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on
his breast and a serene expression on his flat face.
 He went up to Anna Pavlovna,
kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
and complacently seated himself on the sofa.


"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are.
 I confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.
"

Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
part.


In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst
out:

"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria.
 Perhaps I don't understand things,
but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.
 She is
betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.
.
 England with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness
of soul.
 She wanted to find,
and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions.
.
 He will save Europe!"

She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
 A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am expecting
two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is
connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
French families.


The prince was silent and looked indifferent.
 Do you know that since your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
beautiful.


"I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to
the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversation--"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
distributed.
 Do you know I am
dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her face
assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her Majesty's
and you were pitied.
"

The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
awaiting a reply.


"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
children are the bane of my life.
 It can't be helped!"

He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture.
.
' He is very clever
but eccentric, and a bore.
 The poor girl is very unhappy.
 She is rich and of good
family and that's all I want.
"

And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as
he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
"





CHAPTER II


Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling.
 The highest
Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.

Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father
to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge
as maid of honor.
 Prince Vasili's son,
Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
 Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,
but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip.
 As is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness of her
upper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty.


"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,"
replied Anna Pavlovna.


One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable
at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat.


Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
if in search of something.
 But amid these cares her anxiety about
Pierre was evident.
 Seeing the self-confident and
refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting
to hear something very profound.
 At last he came up to Morio.
 The third
group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.
 Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a
treat to her guests.
 The vicomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had
perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons
for Buonaparte's hatred of him.
 Helene was so lovely that not only
did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even
appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty.


"How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
unchanging smile.
.


"Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
took up her work.
 His features were like his
sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary
was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak.
 He was dressed in
a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.


The vicomte told his tale very neatly.
 The latter spared him, and this
magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.


At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate.


Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more
conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
larger circle.
 He turned away from her
with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pavlovna's
hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.


"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.
.
 So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to Pierre.
 He wished to
say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daughter
got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.


"What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would
be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.
 That would be the
best way.
 Prince Vasili's words frightened her, an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she
smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili's arm more tightly.
 Be the kindhearted man you always were," she said,
trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
 You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered since
his appointment as Commander in Chief.
"

"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, "we
shall be late.
 But as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold, artificial expression.
 She returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave.






CHAPTER V


"And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?"
asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and
Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur
Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is as if
the whole world had gone crazy.


"'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!' * They say he was very fine
when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: "'Dio
mi l'ha dato.
 "The sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything.
 "And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal
of the Bourbon cause.


Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde
coat of arms on the table.


"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d'azur--maison Conde," said he.


"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone too far.
 Pierre wished to
make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,
who had him under observation, interrupted:

"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which always
accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has declared
that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their
own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper,
the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its
rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist
emigrant.
"

"It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte without
looking at Pierre.


It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him.
"

"Not in the least," replied the vicomte.
"

Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation
of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and
though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she
was unable to stop him.


"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was a
political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness
of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
that deed.


"What, Monsieur Pierre.
.
.
"

"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected an
ironical voice.
 All were
silent.


"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince Andrew.


"One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man was
great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but.
 She must
have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones.
 That was her
taste.
 And she had a lady's maid, also big.


"She said.
.
 Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a livery,
get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.
 The girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down.
 Anna Pavlovna turned toward
him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to see you again, but I also hope
you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.


"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.
 It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!"

"They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing up
her downy little lip.
"

Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, "And you were
saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to
know how to deal with them.


"What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now," said
Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.
.
 In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but--I do not
know how to express it.
 Write to
me all about it, and I will help you in everything.


"What for? I don't know.
 Besides that I am going.
 She had changed her gown for a house dress as
fresh and elegant as the other.
 How is
it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need it? Now
you shall judge between us.


"When are you starting?" he asked.


"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it spoken of," said
the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken
to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited
to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.
.
.


"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.
.
.
 "You
had better go.

Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.
 But that one word expressed an
entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words.


Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this, rose and approached the princess.
.
 Neither cared to begin talking.


"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry till
you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and
until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake.
.


Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
in amazement.
 He was free, he had nothing
but his aim to consider, and he reached it.
 I am very amiable and have a caustic wit," continued Prince
Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen to me.
 And that stupid set
without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.
.
 You have everything
before you, everything.
.


That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.
.
 "For the present I am free and am
all right.
.
.
 One's head aches, and one
spends all one's money.


"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.
 There was no one in the anteroom; empty
bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
 Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window.


"I don't understand.


The bottle of rum was brought.
 Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
could not move it.
 "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
room.
.
 Fifty imperials.


Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
of his coat and looking down at him--the Englishman was short--began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
 "Wait a bit, Kuragin.
 Listen! If anyone else does the
same, I will pay him a hundred imperials.
 A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life
Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill,
leaned over, and looked down.
 As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more
with the strain.


"It's empty.
 He smelt strongly of rum.
 "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
bottle.
 I'll do it.
.


"What next? Have you gone mad?.
.
 "Wait a bit and
I'll get round him.
 Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but now we
are all going to ----'s.
.
"

And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
and began dancing round the room with it.






CHAPTER X


Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskaya who
had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on the evening of Anna
Pavlovna's soiree.
 Soon after
Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went
straight to her rich relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when
in the town and where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a
regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards
as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
time.
 Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs--the
mother and the youngest daughter--both named Nataly.
 However, I'll see her and no more.
.
.
" came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping
of chairs.
 Then one of those conversations began which last out until,
at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say,
"I am so delighted.
.


"He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna.

Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's affair hushed
up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.

"He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy woman, but
there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a
carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried
to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and
the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal.
 They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have
my daughters to consider.
"

"Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess, turning
away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.


"The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a half
whisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.
.
"

"He is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna.
 "Well, as I was
saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the count
is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the
Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death--and he is so
ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr.
 Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know
it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself.
 I hear he has come on some
inspection business," remarked the visitor.
 The visitor's daughter was already smoothing
down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from
the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to
the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen,
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and
stopped short in the middle of the room.
 Behind her in the doorway
appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards,
a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.


"Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing.
 "My pet, whose name day it is.
 "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her
husband.


This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life--with
childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs
in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers--was just at that
charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
yet a young woman.
 Escaping from her father she ran to hide her
flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla--not paying the least
attention to her severe remark--and began to laugh.
.
 You see.


The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
necessary to take some part in it.
 He evidently tried to find something to say, but
failed.
 Boris on the contrary at once found his footing, and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged
during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked
right across the skull.
 She
turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was
screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable
to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her.


"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the
carriage?" he asked his mother with a smile.
 Sonya was a slender little brunette with
a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black
plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion
and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular
arms and neck.
 She evidently considered it proper to
show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite
of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who
was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that
her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it
was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like
Natasha and Boris, escape from the drawing room.


"But they say that war has been declared," replied the visitor.
"

The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.


"I have already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't wish
to let me go, I'll stay.
" As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness
of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady visitor.


"All right, all right!" said the old count.
 Well, well, God grant it," he added,
not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.
 She gave him a passionately angry glance, and
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile
on her lips, she got up and left the room.
 He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then
with a distressed face left the room to find Sonya.

"Cousinage--dangereux voisinage;" * she added.
"

"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the count, who
always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that
everything was splendid.


"What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too
clever with Vera," said the count.
 She was already
growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming
at once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps approaching
neither quickly nor slowly.

Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears, and muttering
angrily, came in at the other door.


"It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!" sobbed Sonya.
"

"Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"

"So-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,
for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand.

"What will happen now?" thought she.


"Oh, how nice," thought Natasha; and when Sonya and Nicholas had gone
out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her.


Boris followed her, smiling.


"What is the something?" asked he.


"Kiss the doll," said she.


Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
and stood, hanging her head.
.
 In another four
years.
 then I will ask for your hand.
"

Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused.
 The countess pressed her
friend's hand.
.
"

The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.


"If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied as
she rose to go to her own room.
"

Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
replied, and the four simply looked at one another.


"And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris, or
between you two? It's all nonsense!"

"Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defense,
speaking very gently.


"Very silly," said Vera.
"

"I should think not," said Vera, "because there can never be anything
wrong in my behavior.
 But I'll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with
Boris.
 (She used the word
"diplomat," which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the
special sense they attached to it.
) "Why does she bother me?" And she
added, turning to Vera, "You'll never understand it, because you've
never loved anyone.
.
 Let's go to the nursery.
"

All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.


"The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked Vera, "I said none to
anyone.
 Looking at
her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.



In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
 Even in the country do we
get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But
don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed everything.
 I often
wonder at you, Annette--how at your age you can rush off alone in a
carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people,
and know how to deal with them all! It's quite astonishing.
 "That lawsuit taught me much.
 When I want to see one of those big
people I write a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an interview with
So and-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four
times--till I get what I want.
 He paid me attentions in those days," said the countess,
with a smile.
' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation.

But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his
happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now
a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylovna, sadly, dropping her voice.
" She took out her handkerchief and began to cry.
.
 My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov.
.
.
.


"Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
 Let people think what they will of me, it's really all the
same to me when my son's fate is at stake.
 "It's now
two o'clock and you dine at four.


"Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the door,
and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me good
luck.
"

"Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?" said the count
coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: "If
he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us.
 Count
Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all, your future depends on
him.
 Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how
to be.
.
"

Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the
entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old
cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,
hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse
today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
"

The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
away.


"Then it is certain?" said the prince.
.
 The
son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his
mother's face, and he smiled slightly.

Boris bowed politely.
 Prince Vasili without acknowledging the bow turned
to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and
lips indicating very little hope for the patient.


"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing Boris
with severity.
"

"That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina," said Anna
Mikhaylovna.


"They give little hope," replied the prince.
 He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that this fact
ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.


Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned.
.
.
.
 I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me.


"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikhaylovna?"
said he.
 Prince Vasili turned
to her.


"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy
smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece.


The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as
Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had
conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili to take a
seat beside her.
 They ask him to
dinner.
.
"

He shrugged his shoulders.
 A footman conducted Boris down one flight of
stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.






CHAPTER XVI


Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to Moscow.


"How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre.
"

"How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but
unabashed.
.
 If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
him.
.
.
"

"Yes, it seems he is ill.
 People are always disturbing him," answered
Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.


"Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a
considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.


"Ah, Count Rostov!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully.
 "Then you are his son,
Ilya? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first.
 It's such an age.
"

Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
"

Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion's
sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.


"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on.
.
"

"Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "very horrid.
 We are very
poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your
father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and neither
I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.
.
 I know
very well.


"I am glad I have spoken out fully.
 I always make it
a rule to speak out.
 Of course you don't know me.
 He has not
sent for me.
 Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!.
 Adieu,
Prince! May God support you.
.


"The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.


"I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.


"Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere we are to have,
my dear! I tasted it.


"Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?" he called out in a
tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush
to obey the summons.
 "Allow me to
inform you.
 "There is never any 'impossible' with him.
"

"Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world," said
the countess.
"

"Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," the countess began, with a
blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and
she took the money from under the handkerchief.


In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of war
that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting.

The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and
talking.
 He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes.
 This was an old bachelor,
Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a sharp tongue" as they
said in Moscow society.
 Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,
continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime
the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,
might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in
the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him.
 The count, by his guests, went into the drawing
room.



     * Hors d'oeuvres.
.


All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
oldest rose.
 "You must
look for husbands for them whether you like it or not.
.
 "I know she's a scamp of a girl, but
I like her.
.
 The smiling Julie Karagina
went in with Nicholas.
 At one end of the table sat the countess with
Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left, the
other lady visitors were farther down.
 These latter
the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind
the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry Madeira".
.
"

The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to
the service and patriotically Russian.


"It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a German
accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat.
.
.

"Cela nous convient a merveille.
*(2) Suvorov now--he knew what he was
about; yet they beat him a plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find
Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,"*(4) said he, continually changing
from French to Russian.


     *(3) Hollow.



"Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!" said the colonel,
thumping the table; "and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill
pe vell.
 "You know my
son's going, Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going.
"

"I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret.


Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the
elders.


"You had better take care!" said the countess.


Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.


"Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like ice cream.


Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice.
 Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the
same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests
returned to the drawing room and to the count's study.
.
.
.
 I love you and Boris
also," she went on, gaining a little strength; "he is nice.
.
 there are
no difficulties in your way.
.
.
.
 You see how he's been with her all day.
.
"

And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before.
 Natasha lifted
her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting
her.
 You know I have told him all about it.
 Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her
frock and hair.
.


While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
Pierre sat down with his little partner.

Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where
she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and
smiling over the fan.


"Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she crossed
the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.
 But his partner could not and did not
want to dance well.
 Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms
hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her
stern but handsome face really joined in the dance.
 What was expressed
by the whole of the count's plump figure, in Marya Dmitrievna found
expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.


The magnificent reception room was crowded.
 Everyone stood up
respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family.


"Who was that? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at the
other side of the room.
 They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.
"

"Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh.


"Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar," and
he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.


"Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German, addressing
Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
 "Well, sit down: let's have a talk.
 Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
with a sigh.


"And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out
as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very
serious talk.


The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasili's eyes evidently resolved
not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.
.
"

"Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently, rubbing
his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that
he had pushed away.
 in short, the fact is.
 you know yourself
that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.
 "But he
cannot leave the estate to Pierre.
 un
batard!" * she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
word would effectively prove to Prince Vasili the invalidity of his
contention.



"Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so intelligent,
how is it you don't see that if the count has written a letter to the
Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that
Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezukhov, and will then
inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not
destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been
dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit! * That's certain.
 And I tell you for the
tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre's
favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear girl, you and your
sisters are not heiresses! If you don't believe me, then believe
an expert.
 I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich" (the family
solicitor) "and he says the same.
.
"

"Do you or do you not know where that will is?" insisted Prince Vasili,
his cheeks twitching more than ever.


"There is still time, my dear.
 You must remember, Catiche, that it was
all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards
forgotten.
.
.
 I know your excellent heart.
.
.
"

"It's that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that Anna
Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid.
 the infamous, vile
woman!"

"Do not let us lose any time.
.
 Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the
same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.


"Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?" asked Anna Mikhaylovna
of one of them.
 I shall not forget your interests.


This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted
on Prince Vasili's face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide.
 Anna
Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as
if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
 I will look after your interests," said she in
reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
 They were met by a deacon with a censer and by
a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them.
 The same people were still sitting here in almost
the same positions as before, whispering to one another.
 He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
fixed on.


"Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you.
 He looked at Prince Vasili
in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness.
 Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe.
 He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began
crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.

Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of
what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw
happening around him that evening was in some way essential.
"

The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants
that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray
mane--which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of
for a single moment during the whole service.


As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed the young man
he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
man's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by
those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,
leonine head.
 He lay with his head propped high on the pillows.

When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a
look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man.
 Pierre hesitated, not knowing
what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide.
 Anna Mikhaylovna made
a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man's hand and moving
her lips as if to send it a kiss.
 Anna
Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed.
 Suddenly the broad
muscles and lines of the count's face began to twitch.
 The twitching
increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre
realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth
issued an indistinct, hoarse sound.
 Pierre well remembered
this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables.
 Now this same room was dimly
lighted by two candles.
 Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside the
princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.


"But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but
impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
from passing, "won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he
needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already
prepared.
.


"Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases.
.

"Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en
conjure.
.
.


"Pierre, my dear, come here.


"And you too!"

But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.
 does that satisfy you?"

"But, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna, "after such a solemn sacrament,
allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion," said
she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing
with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all
dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasili.


"Remember that you will answer for the consequences," said Prince Vasili
severely.
 "You don't know what you are doing.


At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long
and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged
against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out
wringing her hands.


Pierre gave her an inquiring look.
 With those about
him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably
exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused.


An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
quietly and said in a whisper: "Please walk in.


At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess' face.
 I'll read the
third!"

"Read this if you like, Father," said the princess, blushing still more
and holding out the letter.


"Well, madam," he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter
and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that
she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age
and tobacco, which she had known so long.
"

The princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering
close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
fear would prevent her understanding any of her father's further
explanations, however clear they might be.
 Whether it was the teacher's
fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened every day: the princess'
eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was
only conscious of her stern father's withered face close to her, of his
breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away
quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace.
"

She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
book from the high desk.
.
 Take it.


Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer.
 As with everyone, her face assumed a forced
unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass.
 He is so pure and poetic that
my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.
 Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know
these poignant joys and sorrows.
 You are fortunate, for the latter are
generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,
this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed.
 Fancy! The three princesses
have received very little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is Monsieur
Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezukhov and possessor
of the finest fortune in Russia.
 But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.
 It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasili's
son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich
and distinguee, and it is on you that his relations' choice has fallen.


But enough of gossip.


JULIE

P.
 This is the reply she wrote,
also in French:


Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great
delight.
 What then should I say, if I
dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if
we had not religion to console us life would be very sad.
 I understand such
feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of
them, neither do I condemn them.
 He says the count was the last
representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own
turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible.
 He always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value
most in people.
 Ah, my dear friend, our divine
Saviour's words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly
true.
 A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume
you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow.
 Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain;
for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and
holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms
an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine
ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has
left for our guidance here below.
.

She brought into Princess Mary's strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a
quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.
 Between twelve and two o'clock, as the
day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the
clavichord.
 "Let's
come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smiled at Tikhon, at
her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.


"Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she: "At last! I must let her
know.
 Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
laugh.
 Ah! Mary!" they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.
.
.
"--"You were not expecting us?.
.
.
" "And you have grown stouter!.


Lise sighed too.


"Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her brother.


"He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
promotion.


"Is it certain?" she said.
 Ah! it is very dreadful.
"

Her lip descended.
 "Don't you, Lise?
Take her to your room and I'll go to Father.
 Though I don't know what your opinion will be,"
answered the princess joyfully.


"Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?" said the old
man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tikhon was
holding fast to plait, would allow.
")
He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy
eyebrows.
 Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the
spot indicated to him.
"

"Thank God," said his son smiling.
 "Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!"

"Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see
whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand.
.
.
 a simultaneous expedition.
 The old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
times unexpectedly interrupted.
 Once he stopped it by shouting: "The
white one, the white one!"

This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.

Another time he interrupted, saying:

"And will she soon be confined?" and shaking his head reproachfully
said: "That's bad! Go on, go on.
" *


     * "Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll
     return.
 Go to the dining room.
 Prince Andrew, looking again at that
genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.


"Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.
 The prince asked her about her father, and
she began to smile and talk.


"Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried
her eyes out," she said, growing more and more lively.


"Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it.


And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the
generals and statesmen of the day.
.
 Moreau would
have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; but he had the
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands.
.
 Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!.
.
 You may laugh as much as
you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!"

"Michael Ivanovich!" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy
with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: "Didn't I tell you
Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.
 He has got
splendid soldiers.
"

And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to
him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics.


"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!"

"Dieu sait quand reviendra.
" hummed the prince out of tune and, with a
laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
 When they left the table she
took her sister-in-law's arm and drew her into another room.
 Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.

After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he
ordered the horses to be harnessed.


She smiled as she uttered his pet name, "Andrusha.
 Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner.
"


     * To understand all is to forgive all.
.
.
 Father likes her very much.
.
" said she.

How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except
veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented
and happy with him.
"

Her brother shook his head incredulously.
.
.
.
.
 Andrew.
.
.
" said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
granted.


She looked timidly at her brother.
 What is it?"

"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
never take it off.
" said Prince Andrew.


She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
 Her brother
would have taken the icon, but she stopped him.
 There was a look of tenderness, for
he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
 "She is so sweet, so
good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.


"I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to.
 After crying she had fallen
asleep.
 He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the
Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word.
 When he reached his
sister's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying
one word after another, came through the open door.
 Ha, ha,
ha! Mary!"

This very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh Prince
Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
five times.


When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his
son, sat at the table writing.
 The
Service before everything.
.
 Let
him be here.
.


"I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work," said
Prince Andrew, evidently confused.
"

"Hm.
.
.
 "I'll do it.


"I don't understand!" said Prince Andrew.


Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father
understood him.


"Listen!" said he; "don't worry about your wife: what can be done shall
be.
 Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich.

Write and tell me how he receives you.
 If he is all right--serve
him.
 Send it to the Academy.
.
" he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous
voice suddenly shrieked: "but if I hear that you have not behaved like a
son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!"

"You need not have said that to me, Father," said the son with a smile.
"

"Not let the wife have him?" said the old man, and laughed.
 Something twitched in the lower part of the
old prince's face.


Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.


And this "Well!" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying,: "Now go
through your performance.


"Adieu, Mary," said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and
kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
 Braunau was the headquarters of
the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.
 Despite the un-Russian appearance of the
locality and surroundings--fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and
hills in the distance--and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who
gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment
had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an
inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.


On the evening of the last day's march an order had been received that
the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.
 And not only externally was all in order,
but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he
would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the
appointed number of articles, "awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers
say.
 It was the state of the soldiers' boots.
 More than half the men's
boots were in holes.
 But this defect was not due to any fault of the
regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched
some seven hundred miles.
 He had on a brand-new uniform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders.


"Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?" he said, addressing one of the battalion
commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both
felt happy).
 With this object he intended to meet the regiment;
so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander
in chief would be.
 Though the aide-de-camp did not know these
circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the
commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied.
 "Company commanders!" he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command.
.
 How soon will he be here?" he asked the
aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
personage he was referring to.
"

"Shall we have time to change clothes?"

"I don't know, General.
.
"

The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the
soldiers to change into their greatcoats.


In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray
instead of black.
.
 The captain's face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is
told to repeat a lesson he has not learned.


"You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?"
shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
cloth, which contrasted with the others.
"

"Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
excellency?.
.
"

"Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, who has been reduced to the
ranks," said the captain softly.


"Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If
a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.
"

"Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you young men," said the
regimental commander cooling down a little.
 One says
a word to you and you.
.
"

And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky
steps down the line.


"Why a blue coat? Off with it.
.
 Then amidst a dead silence the feeble
voice of the commander in chief was heard.
 len.
 lency!" and again all became silent.
 Everything was in good order except
the boots.
 The regimental commander
ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of
the commander in chief's regarding the regiment.
 Beside him was his
comrade Nesvitski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly,
smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.
 On reaching the
third company he suddenly stopped.
 His suite, not having expected this,
involuntarily came closer to him.


"Ah, Timokhin!" said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been
reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.


One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
more than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutuzov,
who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,
quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
scarred and puffy face.
 The officer evidently had complete control of his face,
and while Kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.


"Have you a complaint to make?" Kutuzov asked with a slight frown.


"This is Dolokhov," said Prince Andrew.

The Emperor is gracious, and I shan't forget you if you deserve well.


"You won't bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?" said the regimental
commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and
riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front.
.


"Don't mention it, General, as if I'd be so bold!" replied the captain,
his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front
teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at
Ismail.


"And tell Mr.
.
 In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.
"

"I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, showing by his smile that he
understood his commander's wish.


"Well, that's all right," continued the regimental commander.
.
.


The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers.
.
.
 well, thinks I.
.
.
 When they've been put down, the war with Buonaparte will
begin.
 And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you're a fool.
 You'd
better listen more carefully!"

"What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning
into the village already.
"

"And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly.
 There they all seemed
to be Poles--all under the Russian crown--but here they're all regular
Germans.


And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front.
.
.
 The soldiers,
swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long
steps.
 Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,
and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard.


Hussar cornet Zherkov had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the
wild set led by Dolokhov.


"All right.
 They are good fellows.


"The devil only knows! They say so.
 One can at least be of use on the staff.
"

        "It's a long, long way.
 Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were
sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.
" said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he
was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in
French.
 "All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my
personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have
been fulfilled long ago.
 And
believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure
to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better
informed and more skillful general--of whom Austria has so many--and to
lay down all this heavy responsibility.
"

The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply
in the same tone.


Kutuzov bowed with the same smile.


"Give me that letter," said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andrew.


"Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzov, also turning to Prince
Andrew.


Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he
had changed greatly during that period.
 Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different
from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him,
listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince
Andrew was natural and pleasant.


"Any news from Mack?"

"No.
.
 On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly
appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.
"

He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.


"Gott, wie naiv!" * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.



     * "Good God, what simplicity!"


Nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but
Bolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and
turned to Zherkov.


"Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said Nesvitski trying to soothe
him.
 *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could
amuse himself in this way," he added in Russian--but pronouncing the
word with a French accent--having noticed that Zherkov could still hear
him.
"


He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned
and went out of the corridor.






CHAPTER IV


The Pavlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau.
 Cadet Rostov,
ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the
squadron commander.


"Mind, walk him up and down well!"

Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had already
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's head.
 Rostov patted the horse's neck and then his flank, and
lingered for a moment.



    * "Busy already?"

    * (2) "Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!
     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!"


The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and
waving it above his head cried:

"Und die ganze Welt hoch!" *


    * "And hurrah for the whole world!"


Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,
"Und vivat die ganze Welt!" Though neither the German cleaning his
cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and
brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,
and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rostov going
to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.
 "I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about
it, but if he stays out till morning it means he's lost and will come
back in a rage.
 Will you have coffee?"

"Yes, bring some.
 He wore an unfastened cloak,
wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back
of his head.


"Lavwuska!" he shouted loudly and angrily, "take it off, blockhead!"

"Well, I am taking it off," replied Lavrushka's voice.


"Ah, you're up already," said Denisov, entering the room.
"

"Weally! And I've been losing, bwother.


"And what devil made me go to that wat?" (an officer nicknamed "the
rat") he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands.


"He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;
gives the singles and snatches the doubles!"

He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.

"Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the
purse undah the pillow," he said, and went out to the quartermaster.


"Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?" he asked.
.


"Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered Rostov, though the horse
for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum.
 I'll teach you what to do and show
you what kind of rivet to use.


"I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret.


"Have you told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting up and
looking carelessly about him.


"I have.
"

He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,
evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
write, told Rostov the contents of his letter.


"You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep when we don't love.
.
 but one falls in love and one is a God, one is
pua' as on the first day of cweation.
.


"Wetched business," he muttered to himself.


"Where have you put it, Wostov?"

"Under the lower pillow.
"

"It's not there.
"

Denisov threw both pillows on the floor.
.
"

"You're always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it.
 Denisov silently watched Lavrushka's movements, and when the
latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
Denisov glanced at Rostov.
"

Rostov felt Denisov's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly
dropped them again.


"And there hasn't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
yourselves.
 "If the purse isn't found I'll flog you, I'll flog
you all.


"Do you understand what you're saying?" he said in a trembling voice.
.


"Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody," were the last words Rostov
heard.


"No, nothing.


The coin was a new one.


"If we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns there's nowhere to spend it," said he.


"And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite decently
here," continued Telyanin.
"

"Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows
he glanced into Rostov's eyes.


"Come here," said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin's arm and almost
dragging him to the window.


"Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine," muttered Telyanin,
taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room.
 "We must have an
explanation.
.
"

"I know it and shall prove it," said Rostov.
.
.


"Count!.
.
 here is this wretched money,
take it.
" He threw it on the table.
 "I have an old father and
mother!.
.
 He may keep me on
duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me
apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then.
.
 Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not
a diplomatist.
 That's why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one
would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying--so let him give
me satisfaction.
 No one thinks you a coward, but that's not the point.
 He answered the
staff captain's question by a disapproving shake of his head.
"

"He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.


"I did not expect this of you," said the staff captain seriously and
severely.
 The
case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken
advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the
officers.

It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow? You landed
yourself in it.
 "You have been in the regiment next
to no time, my lad, you're here today and tomorrow you'll be appointed
adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said 'There are
thieves among the Pavlograd officers!' But it's not all the same to us!
Am I not right, Denisov? It's not the same!"

Denisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with
his glittering black eyes at Rostov.
 It's not right!"

And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov.
.
.
.
"

"Well, it's as you like," said the staff captain.


"It is an illness, there's no other way of explaining it," said the
staff captain.
 I'd kill him!" shouted
Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone.
 What's the matter, Rostov? You look as if you'd just come out
of a hot bath.
"

The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
Zherkov.
 They were under orders to advance next day.


"We're going into action, gentlemen!"

"Well, thank God! We've been sitting here too long!"





CHAPTER VI


Kutuzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over
the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz).
 Down below,
the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its
cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of Russian troops.
 At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the
Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green
treetops and bluish gorges.


"Thank you very much, Prince," answered one of the officers, pleased to
be talking to a staff officer of such importance.
 Look there
in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.


"Just to flutter the nuns a bit.
 On my word I'd give five years of my life for it!"

"They must be feeling dull, too," said one of the bolder officers,
laughing.


Nesvitski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.


"It's a bad business," said the general without answering him, "our men
have been wasting time.


"Yes, please do," answered the general, and he repeated the order that
had already once been given in detail: "and tell the hussars that
they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.


He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack
and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.


In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
loading.


"What a fine fellow you are, friend!" said the Cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
crowded together close to his wheels and his horses.
 Looking on the bridge he saw equally
uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,
knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with
broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge.
.
" a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily,
with a wide swing of his arm.


"Yes, the ham was just delicious.


"Bah! How they scurry.


"And why are they stopping? There's no proper order!" said the soldiers.

something big, that splashed into the water.


"Encouraging us to get along quicker," said another uneasily.


The crowd moved on again.
 "What
is this? They're like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!.
 Let
us pass!.


"How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nesvitski when the other had
ridden up to him.
 "They
keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day.
 If they mean to fight,
let's fight.


Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge.

Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
nearer.
 Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge
on his side of it.
 "Perched up there, you're more like a bird
than a man.
 Only Denisov's squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could
be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.
 The enemy ceased firing, and that
stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates
two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.
 You fear
and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must
be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will
inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death.
 Cadet Mironov ducked every
time a ball flew past.
 But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of
something new and stern showed round the mouth.
 With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when
they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good
horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle,
he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse
voice to the men to look to their pistols.
 He rode up to Kirsten.

You'll see--we shall retire.
 "Ah,
Wostov," he cried noticing the cadet's bright face, "you've got it at
last.
"

And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet.
 Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.
 Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich Schubert, came
up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostov,
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin.
'"

Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order.
 After him the stout Nesvitski
came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight.
 "I told you to fire
the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside
themselves over there and one can't make anything out.
"

The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvitski.

"How did you get here?" said he, turning to Zherkov.
 But you are damp! Let me wring you out!"

"You were saying, Mr.
 His hand trembled as he gave his horse into
an orderly's charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a
thud.


Rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the
better.



Meanwhile Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite were standing
together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of
men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue
riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was
approaching in the distance from the opposite side--the blue uniforms
and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.


"Ugh.
 "Ah, your excellency! How you look
at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladimir medal
and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be
recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon.
"

He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached
and hurriedly removed.


"Oh! Oh!" groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of
the suite by the arm.
 The infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run.
 But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening there,
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it.


The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
got back to their horses.


Nicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed
into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the
sun.
.
.
.
.
.
.
 And the fear of death and of
the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation.


"O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
me!" Rostov whispered.
"

And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostov, composed of
the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer from the suite.


"Well, it seems that no one has noticed," thought Rostov.
 And this was
true.


"Here's something for you to report," said Zherkov.
"

"Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" said the colonel
triumphantly and gaily.
 For the first time, after a
fortnight's retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had
not only held the field but had repulsed the French.
 Throughout the whole army and at headquarters
most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of
the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.


Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian
General Schmidt, who was killed in the action.
 As a mark
of the commander in chief's special favor he was sent with the news of
this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was
threatened by the French) but at Brunn.
 Despite his apparently delicate
build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at
Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov,
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn.
.
 The dark
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning.
 The snow was
thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides
of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.


At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.


Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded.
 "Day before yesterday, on the Danube,"
answered the soldier.
"

"What news, sir?" asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
conversation.


"Good news!.
 Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,
Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before.
 At the chief entrance
to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.
 Five minutes later he returned and bowing
with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a
corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work.
 He felt offended, and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for.


"Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!" he exclaimed in German.
" Again he pondered.

His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today.
 Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade.
 His Majesty will probably desire to see
you," he added, bowing his head.
 "Franz, put the prince's
things in my bedroom," said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski
in.


Bilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as
Prince Andrew.
 He worked well
whatever the import of his work.
 His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
finished phrases of general interest.
"


He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in
Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.
"

"And why didn't you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have
been there at seven in the morning," returned Bilibin with a smile.
 Even I, a poor secretary of the
Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my
Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater.
 True,
we have no Prater here.
 "I
confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can't make it out.


"Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," Bilibin continued, "and
showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully
described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement.
.


"Well, I think it is.
 The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren't
say so.
"

"What an extraordinary genius!" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,
clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, "and what luck
the man has!"

"Buonaparte?" said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to
indicate that he was about to say something witty.
 The alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery, Bonaparte's
new triumph, tomorrow's levee and parade, and the audience with the
Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.


He woke up.
 Having
dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had
not worn for a long time, he went into Bilibin's study fresh, animated,
and handsome, with his hand bandaged.
 Bilibin
introduced him to the others.
 From
politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions
about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry
jests and gossip.
.
"

"But the worst of it, gentlemen--I am giving Kuragin away to you--is
that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking
advantage of it!"

Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
arm.
 He began to laugh.


"Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!" cried several voices.


"Oh, I must give you a treat," Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski.
 "Kuragin
is exquisite when he discusses politics--you should see his gravity!"

He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking
to him about politics.
 Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these
two.
.
 Besides, unless
His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance.
 He was evidently
distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.
 I want to entertain him as far as I can, with
all the pleasures of life here.
 If we were in Vienna it would be easy,
but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I
beg you all to help me.


"I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the
front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in
the afternoon," replied Bolkonski growing more animated and expecting
that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had
ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen.
 But the Emperor smiled
and interrupted him.
"

The Emperor interrupted him.
 The
Empress' chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty.


Contrary to Bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
received.


"What is it?" he asked.
.
 They have crossed without striking a
blow!"

Prince Andrew could not understand.
"

Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders.
 And off they go and take the bridge, cross it,
and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching
on us, you, and your lines of communication.


"Stop this jesting," he said

"I am not jesting," Bilibin went on.
 *
They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that
the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they
desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on.
 At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear
Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself.
' In a word, those gentlemen,
Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so
flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals,
and so dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes,
qu'il n'y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur
l'ennemi!" *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilibin did not
forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation.
 That puts the court in too bad a light," replied
Bilibin.
 "C'est.
 His
hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
slight smile he began to examine his nails.


"Where are you off to?" he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen
and was going toward his room.
"

"But you meant to stay another two days?"

"But now I am off at once.
 I understand that.
 Mon cher, it is
heroism!"

"Not at all," said Prince Andrew.
.
 You and I will travel comfortably in my caleche.


"I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you
going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,"
and the skin over his left temple puckered, "either you will not reach
your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and
disgrace with Kutuzov's whole army.
"

"My dear fellow, you are a hero!" said Bilibin.
 Near Hetzelsdorf Prince
Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with
great haste and in the greatest disorder.
"


     * "That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of
     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
     fate--(the fate of the army at Ulm).


Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to
a convoy.
 Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,
evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a caleche.
 Prince Andrew rode up
and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle.
 Aide-de-camp! Mr.
 For heaven's sake.
 Protect
me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
Chasseurs.
.
"

"I'll flatten you into a pancake!" shouted the angry officer to the
soldier.
 Aide-de-camp! Help me!.
 What does it all mean?" screamed the
doctor's wife.
 Don't you see it's a woman?" said Prince
Andrew riding up to the officer.
 Back!"

"Let them pass, I tell you!" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his
lips.
 This
expression evidently pleased him.
 He saw that his
championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him to
what he dreaded more than anything in the world--to ridicule; but his
instinct urged him on.
.
 This
was particularly noticeable on Nesvitski's usually laughing countenance.


"Well, is it true that it's peace and capitulation?" asked Nesvitski.
 "But sit down and have
something to eat.
"

"Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses," said Nesvitski.
 The clerk, with cuffs turned
up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards.


"Second line.
"

"One can't write so fast, your honor," said the clerk, glancing angrily
and disrespectfully at Kozlovski.
 "Dispositions for Bagration.


"One moment, your excellency.
"

Bagration, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,
impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.

"Get in with me," said he to Bolkonski.
 Allow me to remain
with Prince Bagration's detachment.
 Five minutes later, gently swaying
on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.
 If Kutuzov decided to abandon
the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would
have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains,
defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
all hope of a junction with Buxhowden.

Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.


Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his
hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers
by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrunn
a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from
Vienna.
 Hence Bagration with his four thousand
hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
that came upon him at Hollabrunn, which was clearly impossible.
 Murat declared that
negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore
offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.


A truce was Kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagration's
exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys
(whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one
stage nearer Znaim.
 On receiving the news he
immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in
attendance on him, to the enemy camp.
 Break
the armistice immediately and march on the enemy.
 March on, destroy the Russian
army.
 You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
 Officers are nothing
when they have no powers; this one had none.
 They talked of
peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle
but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.
.
 Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince's
permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the
forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an
order.
"

They dismounted and entered the tent.
 Now you, Captain," and he
turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots
(he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings,
rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.


The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.
 Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at
the entrenchment, and went on again.
 Just behind it they came upon some
dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the
entrenchment.
 They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.


"Voila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince," * said the staff
officer.



    * "This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.
 Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.


"That's our battery," said the staff officer indicating the highest
point.
 You
can see everything from there; let's go there, Prince.
 At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm
could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the
more confident was the appearance of our troops.


Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,
crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting
a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him.
 It's fine!" answered Sidorov, who was considered
an adept at French.


The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov.


"Now then, go on, go on!" incited the officer, bending forward and
trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
him.


"We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off," said
Dolokhov.
," * said Dolokhov.
.
.


"Not Bonaparte.
 He is the Emperor! Sacre nom.
.
 "Now,
Sidorov, you have a try!"

Sidorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless
sounds very fast: "Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaska," he said,
trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.


But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
confronted one another as before.


It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the
greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery.
 Our right flank was
posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.
 In the center, where Tushin's battery stood and from which
Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern.
 All the time he had been beside the gun,
he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens
had not understood a word of what they were saying.


"No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a
familiar voice, "what I say is that if it were possible to know what is
beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it.
"

Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: "Afraid or not, you can't
escape it anyhow.


"Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speaker, he of the familiar
voice.
 Whatever we may
say about the soul going to the sky.
.


"Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin," it said.
" He recognized the agreeable,
philosophizing voice with pleasure.
"

He did not finish.
 Here it is!" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood
rush to his heart.
 Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for
him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in his horse and recognizing
Prince Andrew nodded to him.
 Behind Prince Bagration
rode an officer of the suite, the prince's personal adjutant, Zherkov,
an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed
horse, and a civilian--an accountant who had asked permission to
be present at the battle out of curiosity.


"He wants to see a battle," said Zherkov to Bolkonski, pointing to the
accountant, "but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.
 (He
remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince, but could not get it quite right.
)

By this time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and a ball
struck the ground in front of them.
 f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding
a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with
his horse.


He asked, "Whose company?" but he really meant, "Are you frightened
here?" and the artilleryman understood him.


As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
former position.
 He rode off at a walk to the right and sent
an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French.
 Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while
blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle.
 He had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.

In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after
the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back.
 Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign
that this was exactly what he had desired and expected.
 "There, you see!"
and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing
continually around them.
 All eyes fastened
involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding
down over the uneven ground.


The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came
two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order.
.
.
.
 The soldiers passed in a semicircle
round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the
flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men,
ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back
angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet
beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left.
.


"Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagration.


Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted.
 Several
of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so
gaily and complacently.
 But at the moment the first report was heard,
Bagration looked round and shouted, "Hurrah!"

"Hurrah--ah!--ah!" rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and passing
Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous
and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.
 The retirement of the center to the other side
of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the
different companies did not get mixed.
 Bagration had sent Zherkov to the
general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.
 He was seized by panic and could not go where it was
dangerous.
 But the command of the extreme left flank had been
assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment in which Rostov
was serving, and a misunderstanding arose.
 Cannon and musketry, mingling
together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of
Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming
up within twice the range of a musket shot.
.
"

"Quite avare, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel, touching
his horse and turning purple in the face.
 "Vill you be so goot to
come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don't vish to
destroy my men for your pleasure!"

"You forget yourself, Colonel.
 The French had attacked
the men collecting wood in the copse.
 It was no longer possible for the
hussars to retreat with the infantry.


"Faster!" came the word of command, and Rostov felt Rook's flanks
drooping as he broke into a gallop.


"Hur-a-a-a-ah!" came a roar of voices.
 Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the
squadron.
 "No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.
 "Can something bad have happened to me?" he wondered
as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was
hanging on his benumbed left arm.

He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it.
 "Ah,
here are people coming," he thought joyfully, seeing some men running
toward him.
 "They will help me!" In front came a man wearing a strange
shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose.
 In among the hindmost of these men wearing
similar shakos was a Russian hussar.
 A shudder of terror went
through him: "No, better not look," he thought, but having reached the
bushes he glanced round once more.
 "No, there's some mistake," thought he.
 "They can't have wanted
to kill me.


Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind
the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and
descending the valley.
 Everything seemed lost.
 But at that
moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent
reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian
sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse.
 Timokhin, armed
only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and
such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had
thrown down their muskets and run.
 The man was wearing a bluish coat
of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and
over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung.
 He had an officer's
sword in his hand.
 Though the
commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov, he
could not help taking notice of the soldier.


But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his
head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.


Soon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded in
setting fire to Schon Grabern.
 Grand!" The fire,
fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading.
 Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,
but only changed character.
 Tushin's companion officer
had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
seventeen of the forty men of the guns' crews had been disabled, but the
artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever.


Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
occurred to him.
 Though he
thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the
best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to
feverish delirium or drunkenness.
.
 he's puffing again," muttered Tushin to himself, as a small
cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the
wind.


"Now look out for the ball.
.
 "Matvevna" * was the
name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large
and of an old pattern.
 The sound of
musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing,
seemed like someone's breathing.
 He listened intently to the ebb and
flow of these sounds.



"Ah! Breathing again, breathing!" he muttered to himself.


"I.
" he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.
"

But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say.
 He turned his horse and galloped off.
 Among the limbers lay
several dead men.
 He delivered the order and did not
leave the battery.
 "Not like your honor!"

Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin.


"Good-by, my dear fellow," said Tushin.
 "Dear soul! Good-by, my dear
fellow!" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.
 It was growing
dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous.
 Interrupting one another,
they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,
reprimanding and reproaching him.
.
 I can't walk.
 "Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,"
he said, addressing his favorite soldier.
 Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,
Antonov.


"No, it's a sprain.
 It
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
off, and the firing had begun to subside.
 Suddenly, near by on the
right, shouting and firing were again heard.


"Not hurt, Petrov?" asked one.
 How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing
could be seen.
 Pitch-dark, brother! Isn't there something to drink?"

The French had been repulsed for the last time.
 All remained where they were in the middle of
the muddy road.
 Captain Tushin,
having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing
station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the
soldiers had kindled on the road.
 The sound
of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving in mud, the
crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.


It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the
gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.


"You picked it up?.
 I dare say! You're very smart!" one of them
shouted hoarsely.


"Must one die like a dog?" said he.


Tushin told them to give the man some water.


"Still aching?" Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.


"Coming, friend.
 Prince Bagration was thanking the
individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
losses.


"When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was
disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: 'I'll let them come
on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'--and that's
what I did.
 I was there all the time giving orders and had only just
left.
.


"I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said Prince Andrew, coldly and
abruptly.
 He stood before Bagration with his lower
jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: "I don't know.
.
 your
excellency.
.
 I had no men.
 your excellency.
"

Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at Bolkonski,
who spoke with suppressed agitation.


Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to show distrust
in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it,
bent his head, and told Tushin that he could go.
 It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.
 It was they, these soldiers--wounded and
unwounded--it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting
the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder.
 It would not ache--it
would be well--if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to
get rid of them.
 Flakes of falling snow were
fluttering in that light.
 Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.
 He
was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit.
 Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,
were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the
circumstances and persons he met.
"
But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told
him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince
Vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him,
become intimate with him, and finally make his request.
 With apparent absent-mindedness,
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,
Prince Vasili did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter.
 He had to
sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of
which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his
estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not
even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
and grieved had he chosen not to see them.
 With drooping eyes
and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past
misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for
anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,
to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where
she had sacrificed so much.

From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began
knitting a striped scarf for him.


It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it
would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could
not but believe in the sincerity of those around him.
 I am very glad.

The diplomatic career now lies open before you.
 It is high time for you to get away from these terrible
recollections.
 And my valet
can go in your carriage.
 "You
know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have
received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it; you won't
require it.


Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.


Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" was like the former one, only the novelty she
offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh
from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander's
visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged
themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice
against the enemy of the human race.
 The large group, in which were Prince Vasili and the generals,
had the benefit of the diplomat.
" (She
glanced at Helene and smiled at her.
 She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what
she was to do with these people.


Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted.


"That is probably the work of Vinesse," said Pierre, mentioning a
celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the
snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.
 Helene stooped forward to make room,
and looked round with a smile.
 And at that moment
Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his wife, and that
it could not be otherwise.


He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
altar with her.
 The architect had told him that it was necessary, and
Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house
done up.
 You need
advice.
 He
muttered something and colored.
 What had happened? Nothing.


"But she's stupid.
 Hippolyte is her brother.
.
 And he again saw her not as the daughter
of Prince Vasili, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray
dress.
 "Youth, frivolity.

I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he
ought to do then it will be my affair--yes, my affair.
 I am her father.
 She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in
comparison with that smile.
 All these friends and
relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl
would be decided that evening.
 The visitors were seated at supper.

Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,
was sitting at the head of the table.
 On either side of her sat the
more important guests--an old general and his wife, and Anna Pavlovna
Scherer.


"Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," answered Prince Vasili,
laughing, "'Sergey Kuzmich.
.
' Poor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther! He began the
rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered 'Sergey' he sobbed,
'Kuz-mi-ch,' tears, and 'From all sides' was smothered in sobs and he
could get no farther.
.
.
.
 and then tears," someone repeated
laughing.
.
"

Everybody laughed a great deal.
 Only Pierre and
Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a
suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing
to do with Sergey Kuzmich--a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings.
.
.

"That's happiness!"

Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another.
 It seemed as if the very light of
the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.
 So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with
her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her.
 Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was
not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they
all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would
expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune.
 "Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought Pierre.
 The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave
of Helene.
 Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important
occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,
refusing to let her see them off.
 "That Princess Helene will be beautiful still when she's
fifty.
 Prince Vasili came up to Pierre with languid
footsteps.


When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife,
was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.
"

"Marriages are made in heaven," replied the elderly lady.
 "My wife has told me everything!" (He
put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.
)--"My dear
boy.
.
 I am very pleased.
 Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful
Helene's hand several times.
 After a while they were left alone again.
" Pierre held the
hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it
rose and fell.


"Something special is always said in such cases," he thought, but could
not remember what it was that people say.
.
.


"It is too late now, it's done; besides I love her," thought Pierre.


A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili's servants came one evening
in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.
 And now,
from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,
he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will.
 On the day of Prince Vasili's arrival, Prince Bolkonski was
particularly discontented and out of temper.
 "Stepping flat on his
heels--we know what that means.
"

The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,
frowning.
.
 Blackguards.
" shouted the prince rapidly.
 Throw the snow back on the road!" did not lift
his stick again but hurried into the house.


"Fool.
.
 It is natural in her state.


"I am afraid for the baby," she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne: "Heaven
knows what a fright might do.
 "His
Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son, I understand?" she said
inquiringly.
.
.
 "Why his son is coming I don't
understand.


After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law.


"Do you want anything?"

"No, merci, mon pere.
 Forgive me for heaven's sake.
"

"All right, all right," interrupted the prince, and laughing his
unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss, and then
proceeded to his study.
 He was met in the avenue by coachmen
and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the
lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.
"

"I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?" Anatole asked, as if
continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned
during the journey.
 Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,
vainly trying to master her agitation.


"Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never
happen!" she said, looking at herself in the glass.
 Now please, do it for my sake.
"

The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess
Mary.


"At least, change your coiffure," said the little princess.
 When she looked up at him she was
struck by his beauty.
 But Anatole was dumb, swung his
foot, and smilingly examined the princess' hair.
 It was evident that he
could be silent in this way for a very long time.
 Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner
which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love--a
supercilious consciousness of his own superiority.
 The princess
felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare
expect to interest him, she turned to his father.
 Prince Vasili readily adopted her tone and the
little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these
amusing recollections of things that had never occurred.
 Mademoiselle
Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself
pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.
 "Ah, I know, I know," she said with a sly glance, "your brother
Hippolyte told me about your goings on.
 What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about
which he always deceived himself.
 "To be unhappy for certain.
 He seemed to listen
attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but kept glancing at Princess
Mary.


"Now you, young prince, what's your name?" said Prince Bolkonski,
turning to Anatole, "come here, let us talk and get acquainted.


"No, I have been transferred to the line," said Anatole, hardly able to
restrain his laughter.
.

what is it I am attached to, Papa?" said Anatole, turning to his father
with a laugh.


"A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I attached to!' Ha, ha, ha!"
laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still louder.
 The lad's
a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.
" He took Prince
Vasili's arm and led him to his study.
 As soon as they were alone
together, Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old
prince.
 "Let her marry, it's all the same to me!"
he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.


Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure.
 He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and
magnanimous.
 Mademoiselle
Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her
off; and here at last was a Russian prince.
 So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle
Bourienne's head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about
Paris.


After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
asked to play on the clavichord.

Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic.
 Mademoiselle Bourienne
was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a
look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.


"What delicacy!" thought the princess.
 "Is it possible that Amelie"
(Mademoiselle Bourienne) "thinks I could be jealous of her, and not
value her pure affection and devotion to me?" She went up to her and
kissed her warmly.


"No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well I will give you my hand to kiss.


She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.
 Tikhon, half asleep, heard him
pacing angrily about and snorting.


"The first man that turns up--she forgets her father and everything
else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice
it.
 He guessed that the question referred to Prince
Vasili and his son.


Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,
up to the appearance of the pauvre mere; they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone.

It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it.
 "I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not
come and brought his pupil with him" (for some reason Prince Bolkonski
referred to Anatole as a "pupil") "for the sake of my beautiful eyes.
 That's how it's to be understood! 'How understand
it'!.


"That's admirable!" he shouted.
"

The prince stopped.
 Go to your room, think it over,
and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.
 I know
you will pray over it.
 She was
going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing
anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle
Bourienne aroused her.
 She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw
Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her.
 With
a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess
Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle
Bourienne who had not yet seen her.
 Anatole bowed to
Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
that led to his own apartments.


An hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;
he added that Prince Vasili was also there.
 He hurriedly took a
pinch of snuff.
 "The prince is making a
proposition to you in his pupil's--I mean, his son's--name.
 Do you
wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin's wife? Reply: yes or no," he
shouted, "and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also.

Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," added Prince Bolkonski, turning
to Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look.
 Say 'perhaps.
 "Very, very glad to have seen you," repeated he, embracing
Prince Vasili.
 "My vocation
is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love
and self-sacrifice.


Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still
living with the Rostovs.


The count sobbed yet more.
 a.
 wounded.
.
.
.
.


"If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would have killed even more of those
Frenchmen," he said.
"

"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"

"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.


"Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's silence.


"Do I remember Nicholas?"

"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,
remember everything?" said Natasha, with an expressive gesture,
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning.
.

No!" (She shut her eyes.
 She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
 The question of how to write to Nicholas, and
whether she ought to write, tormented her.
"

"And I know why she'd be ashamed," said Petya, offended by Natasha's
previous remark.
 "It's because she was in love with that fat one in
spectacles" (that was how Petya described his namesake, the new Count
Bezukhov) "and now she's in love with that singer" (he meant Natasha's
Italian singing master), "that's why she's ashamed!"

"Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.
 "Come
later.


The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.


Nicholas' letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were
considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she
did not let it out of her hands.
 What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered
everybody! Not forgetting anyone.
.
 And so it was
decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courier to
Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas.
 Rostov had not yet had time to get his
uniform.
 The Don horse he was riding
was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a
crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head.
 Berg and Boris, having rested
after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a
round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess.


"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.
 "And Berg too! Oh, you
petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian
nurse's French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.
 But
notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and
kissed him three times.


Without answering, Rostov shook the soldier's Cross of St.
 You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode
with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every
advantage.
 And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our
officers.
 "I say, send for some wine.


"Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you," he added.


Rostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
arms on the table and began to read.
 "As for us, Count, we get along on our pay.
.
.


Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
 "He would drink with you.

I can't.
"

"Well, send for him.
 I came forward.
.
" (Berg stood up and showed
how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it
would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and
self-complacency than his did.
.
.
 That's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting
his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.


But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
skillfully changed the subject.
 Besides, to tell everything as
it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of
will to tell only what happened.
 It is very difficult to tell the truth,
and young people are rarely capable of it.
 His hearers expected a story
of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like
a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his
saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on.

Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without
indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.


Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was
rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
doubled.


A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man's
self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov's soul.
 Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and
yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
enormous whole.


A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops.
 One voice was heard shouting: "Eyes
front!" Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by
others from various sides and all became silent.
 Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men--the
Emperors.
 The Tsar
called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.
"

"Oh, to die, to die for him," thought Rostov.
 "Is it
worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such
love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels
and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.


Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman, spurred
Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited.


When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also
Kutuzov's, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about
the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte,
and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps
arrived and Prussia took our side.


But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander.
 His
every word and movement was described with ecstasy.


They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the
enemy under the Emperor's command.






CHAPTER IX


The day after the review, Boris, in his best uniform and with his
comrade Berg's best wishes for success, rode to Olmutz to see Bolkonski,
wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best
post he could--preferably that of adjutant to some important personage,
a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.
 Another,
the red, stout Nesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head,
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him.
 A third was
playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on
the clavichord, sang the tune.
 Bolkonski was not there.
 Boris thanked him and went to
the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.


"Very well, then, be so good as to wait," said Prince Andrew to the
general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris, Prince
Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
smile.
 We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.
 He has had a letter from
Prince Kuragin about me.
 We'll talk it over," replied Prince Andrew.
"

While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that
gentleman--evidently not sharing Boris' conception of the advantages
of the unwritten code of subordination--looked so fixedly at the
presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable.


"You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you," said Prince
Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was.

There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But
this is what we'll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an
excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov; and though you may not know it, the
fact is that now Kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for
nothing.
 Everything is now centered round the Emperor.
 He very readily took up Boris' cause and went with
him to Dolgorukov.
 Everyone at headquarters was
still under the spell of the day's council, at which the party of the
young had triumphed.


"What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on.
 I
tell you he is in our hands, that's certain! But what was most amusing,"
he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, "was that we could not
think how to address the reply! If not as 'Consul' and of course not as
'Emperor,' it seemed to me it should be to 'General Bonaparte.
 "You know
Bilibin--he's a very clever fellow.


"All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address.
"

"What was it?"

"To the Head of the French Government.
.
 Au chef du gouvernement
francais," said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction.


"Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he's dined with him--the
present Emperor--more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a
more cunning or subtle diplomatist--you know, a combination of French
adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and
Count Markov? Count Markov was the only man who knew how to handle him.
" but before Prince
Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the
Emperor.
.
 another
time!"

Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
as he felt himself to be at that moment.
 He was conscious that here
he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,
obedient, and insignificant atom.
 Prince Andrew did
neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned
away and went down the side of the corridor.
 It is such men
as he who decide the fate of nations," added Bolkonski with a sigh he
could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.


Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of
Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorukov
again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment.
 Their squadron remained in
reserve and Nicholas Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood.


"If you like, your honor!"

The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.

The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
accent.


Rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.


All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the road behind
him several riders with white plumes in their hats.

Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of
himself had vanished.
 He was filled with happiness at his nearness to
the Emperor.
 He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of
meeting arrives.


The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve
o'clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward
the vanguard.
 Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met
him with news of the successful result of the action.
 A few minutes after the Emperor had
passed, the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance.
 The Emperor, surrounded by his suite
of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head.
 An
adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on
a stretcher that had been brought.
 Denisov celebrated his promotion to
the rank of major, and Rostov, who had already drunk enough, at the end
of the feast proposed the Emperor's health.


"Lads! here's to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our
enemies! Hurrah!" he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar's baritone.
 "It is such a lofty,
beautiful feeling, such a.
"

"I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove.
.
"

"No, you don't understand!"

And Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of
what happiness it would be to die--not in saving the Emperor's life (he
did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes.






CHAPTER XI


The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,
was repeatedly summoned to see him.


At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with
a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was
brought into Wischau from our outposts.
 At midday
he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with
Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army.


Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military
machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted
to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
reached.
"

And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother's
plan of a flanking movement.
"

"Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgorukov.


Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: "I
think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstoy and asked
him to tell the Emperor.
 Whether he was
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at
headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
to.


He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
commander in chief.
 He really was asleep.
.

The first column marches.
.
.

The tall, fair-haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning his back against
the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen.
 He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother's face, and
only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished
reading.
 But one could not tell from that significant look whether he
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements.
 In the middle of one of the
longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised
his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something.
 But the
Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his
elbows, as if to say: "You can tell me your views later, but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen.
" Langeron lifted his eyes with an
expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an
explanation, but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless gaze
drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
 Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
be they what they might.


But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
rather than of what the generals were disputing about.


"The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
his camp," said he.
"

"How is that?.
.
 "You have heard them,
and we shall all do our duty.
 It was past
midnight.
 "But was it really not possible for Kutuzov to state his views
plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account of court and
personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life, my
life," he thought, "must be risked?"

"Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow," he thought.

And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant,
most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last
parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he
first loved her.
 Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,
I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I
can do.
 "But death and suffering?" suggested another
voice.
 Kutuzov is removed and he is appointed.
 what then?.
" "Well then," Prince Andrew answered
himself, "I don't know what will happen and don't want to know, and
can't, but if I want this--want glory, want to be known to men, want to
be loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing
but that and live only for that.
 The voices
were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a
coachman's, was teasing Kutuzov's old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and
who was called Tit.
 He was saying, "Tit, I say, Tit!"

"Well?" returned the old man.


"Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag.
 "Why
not?.
.
.
.
.
.
 Natasha.
 He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish
drowsiness.
.
.
.
.
 Cut them
down! What?.
 His horse and the horse of the hussar near him
pricked their ears at these shouts.
 "That must be the enemy's camp!"

The hussar did not reply.


"Why, don't you hear it?" Rostov asked again, after waiting for a reply.


"Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluctantly.


"From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rostov.


"It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar.
 The shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
of several thousand men could produce.
 Rostov no longer
wanted to sleep.


Rostov, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with
the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.
 Rostov rode up to Bagration, reported to
him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were
saying.
.
 In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but
when he reached it he found it was a road.
 Having come out onto the road
he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it
and ride over the black field up the hillside.
 Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.
 "They might
retreat and leave the pickets.


"Thank God!"


The fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned by the fact
that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read to the troops the
Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs.
 They are the same battalions you broke at
Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place.
 The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the
soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them.
 The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and
packed the wagons and tied on the loads.
 However far he has walked, whatever
strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is
always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so
the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks,
the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the same company dog Jack, and the
same commanders.
 On the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
what is going on around them.


The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead.
 On the contrary, the soldiers became
aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns
were moving in the same direction.
 A regular
Moscow!"

Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of
humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves
to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops
marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to
an attack.
 But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks.
 Had the Russian army been
alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
occasioned by the sausage eaters.
 It's all those damned
Germans' muddling! What stupid devils!"

"Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, they're crowding up
behind.


"What division are you?" shouted an adjutant, riding up.


"The Eighteenth.
 Fine orders!" was being repeated on different sides.


The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right.
 Several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry, who had to wait.
 The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to
blame.
 After
an hour's delay they at last moved on, descending the hill.
 tat--and then more and
more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.
 Above him was a clear
blue sky, and the sun's vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson
float on the surface of that milky sea of mist.
 His predictions were being justified.
 The marshals,
accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and
a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly
toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by
Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.
 He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola.
"

In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was
a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a
milk-white sea.
 The commander in chief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him.


"You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very
fine!"

"The enemy is still far away, your excellency.
"

"The dispositions!" exclaimed Kutuzov bitterly.
.
.


Kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon
Prince Andrew, who was beside him.
 Tell it to stop and await my orders.
 Two of them
rode side by side in front, at full gallop.


At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed
brighter and more energetic.
 The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very
erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner.
"

The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his
rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near him, as
if complaining of Kutuzov.


"You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not on the Empress' Field where
a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled," said the
Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if
not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying.


"That is just why I do not begin, sire," said Kutuzov in a resounding
voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and
again something in his face twitched--"That is just why I do not begin,
sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress' Field," said
clearly and distinctly.


The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutuzov's eye waiting to
hear whether he would say anything more.
 But Kutuzov, with respectfully
bowed head, seemed also to be waiting.
 The French were supposed to be a
mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
front of us.
.
.
 But how is
that?" said different voices.


A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.
 A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
approached Kutuzov.


"Oh! Oh! Oh!" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around.


"Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing
with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.


"Hurrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy
standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion
would follow him.
 One soldier moved and then
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hurrah!" and
overtook him.
 In front he saw our
artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned
their guns, were running toward him.
 He also saw French infantry
soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
round.
 Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
of the cannon.
 He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired
gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while
a French soldier tugged at the other.
.
"

And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to
the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had
triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,
was about to be decided.
 It hurt a little, but the worst of
it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
been looking at.
 But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace.
"





CHAPTER XVII


On our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock the battle
had not yet begun.
 Bagration knew that as the distance between the two
flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed
(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief
(which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before
evening.


"And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief,
your excellency?" said Rostov, with his hand to his cap.
 At first he rode along the line of Bagration's
troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing
motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov's cavalry
and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having
passed Uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and
musketry ahead of him.
 The firing grew louder and louder.


"Go on! Go on! Give it them!" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,
and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and
farther into the region where the army was already in action.
 Rostov got out of their way,
involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.


The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.
 He could see nothing more, for
immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
enveloped everything.
 Rostov was horrified to hear later that
of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,
rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their
thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.


"Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see
the Emperor immediately!" thought Rostov and galloped on.
 I must look for the
commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest.
"

"I saw him myself," replied the man with a self-confident smile of
derision.
 I saw him just as I see you.
.


"Who? Kutuzov?" asked Rostov.


"Not Kutuzov, but what's his name--well, never mind.
.
 It was impossible to
doubt it now.
 The
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in Rostov's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for
himself.
 "What would she feel,"
thought he, "if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed
at me?"

In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from
the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less
disordered.
 Those speeches
were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part
to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was
dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and
while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.
 The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling
unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.
 not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign.
.
 In front of him walked Kutuzov's groom leading horses
in horsecloths.


"Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom.



Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points.
 Other columns
after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
masses.


Dolokhov--now an officer--wounded in the arm, and on foot, with the
regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,
represented all that was left of that whole regiment.
 Impelled by the
crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in
on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
cannon and the crowd were dragging it out.


"Turn this way!" he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked under
him; "turn this way!" he shouted to those with the gun.
 The men looked at him and pressed to the
bank, hesitating to step onto the ice.
 Nobody gave him a look or thought of
raising him.

The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped
into the water.
 The ice, that had held under
those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on
it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.
 Bonaparte riding
over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
on the field.


"The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,"
said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at
Augesd.
 His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky.
 He collected all his strength, to stir and
utter a sound.


"All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
Alexander's Guards," said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in
the white uniform of the Horse Guards.


Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg
society.


"Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.


"I commanded a squadron," replied Repnin.
 "And who is that young man
beside you?"

Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.
 "Young man, you will go far!"

Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor's
eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his
attention.


His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
 At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious.
 Visions of his father,
wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and
above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious
fancies.






BOOK FOUR: 1806





CHAPTER I


Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave.


"How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
shops, bakers' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!" thought Rostov,
when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
entered Moscow.


"Denisov! We're here! He's asleep," he added, leaning forward with his
whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
sleigh.
 Don't you see? That's our
house," said Rostov.
 "Now then, get on," he shouted to the driver.
 It seemed
to him the horses were not moving at all.


Old Michael was asleep on the chest.
 Only his mother was not there, he noticed
that.
.
.
 My darling!.
.
.
.
 Tea!.
.
 Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at
this moment of happy, rapturous excitement.
 All the others let him go, and he ran to her.
 Natasha, Vera, look! Here is
Denisov!"

The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denisov.


Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostovs all
gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.


The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every
movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring
eyes off him.
 Two freshly
cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall.


"Is this your saber?" he shouted.


"Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!" said Natasha's voice.


"Is this your saber?" asked Petya.
 They were
dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and
bright.
 Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking her brother's arm, led him
into the sitting room, where they began talking.
 "I want to
know what you men are like.
 Look here!"

She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,
slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered
even by a ball dress.


"We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
nonsense, but we are friends forever.
.
 But it won't do, because you see, if you say that--if you
consider yourself bound by your promise--it will seem as if she had not
meant it seriously.
 Today, when he had caught
a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely.
 "We'll talk it over later on.


"Oh, what nonsense!" cried Natasha, laughing.
 "Have you
seen Duport?"

"No.

That's what I'm up to.
 "So that's what I'm up to! I'll never marry anyone,
but will be a dancer.


"But that's all rubbish," Natasha chattered on.
"

"You call him Vaska? That's funny! And is he very nice?"

"Very.
 He did not know how
to behave with her.






CHAPTER II


On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostov was welcomed
by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling
Nikolenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young
man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good
dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.
 The old count had money enough
that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
passed his time very gaily.
 To him the Club entrusted the
arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration, for few men knew so
well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and
still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.

The club cook and the steward listened to the count's orders with
pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
several thousand rubles.


"Well then, mind and have cocks' comb in the turtle soup, you know!"

"Shall we have three cold dishes then?" asked the cook.


"We can't have less--yes, three.
.


"Ah, my boy, my head's in a whirl!" said the old man with a smile, as if
he felt a little confused before his son.
 I shall have my own orchestra, but
shouldn't we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like that
sort of thing.
 "Dear, dear!.
.


"Tell Bezukhov to come.
 "If what we hear
is true, it is dreadful.
 "They say Pierre
is quite broken by his misfortune.
"

"Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Club--it will all blow
over.
 It will be a tremendous banquet.
 These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective
commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and of the
Frenchman Langeron, Kutuzov's incapacity, and (it was whispered) the
youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless and
insignificant people.

Moreover, paying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing
disapproval and dislike of Kutuzov.


"Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary to invent
him," said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire.
 Berg
was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded
in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone forward.
 A minority of those present
were casual guests--chiefly young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov,
and Dolokhov--who was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment.
 The
faces of these young people, especially those who were military men,
bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which
seems to say to the older generation, "We are prepared to respect and
honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs to us.
 Shinshin, standing close
by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed to
learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him
feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of
Kutuzov.
 Young Rostov stood at a window with
Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued.
.
 been together out
there.
 both playing the hero.
 There was something naively
festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile
features, gave him a rather comical expression.
 Bekleshev and Theodore
Uvarov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,
as the guest of honor, to enter first.
 He walked shyly
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing
what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at
Schon Grabern--and he would have found that easier.
 The committeemen
met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a
highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting
for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room.
 The bigwigs, the most respected members of the Club,
beset the new arrivals.
 On the salver lay some verses composed and printed
in the hero's honor.
 But all eyes demanded that he should
submit.
 Bagration bowed his head and listened:

   Bring glory then to Alexander's reign
   And on the throne our Titus shield.
.


and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his
verses, bowed to Bagration.
 Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more
important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the rest,
went in to dinner.
.
.
.
.
 They drank to Bekleshev,
Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the committee, to
all the Club members and to all the Club guests, and finally to Count
Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer of the banquet.
 At that
toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept
outright.
 Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the
princess' hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dolokhov,
who was sitting opposite him.
 Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov's
handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous
rising in his soul and turned quickly away.
 He involuntarily remembered
how Dolokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after the
campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him.
 Pierre recalled how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of
Dolokhov's living at their house, and how cynically Dolokhov had praised
his wife's beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had
not left them for a day.
 I have no right to, and can't, believe it.
 That expression was often
on Dolokhov's face when looking at him.

Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov were now sitting opposite Pierre and
seemed very gay.
 Rostov was talking merrily to his two friends, one of
whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and
rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose
preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one
at the dinner.


"Well, now to the health of handsome women!" said Dolokhov, and with
a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.


Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at
Dolokhov or answering him.
 The footman, who was distributing leaflets
with Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal
guests.
 He
leaned his whole massive body across the table.


Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
.
.


Dolokhov paused.



Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drove to the
Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already there.
 He had
evidently not slept that night.
 He was entirely absorbed by two
considerations: his wife's guilt, of which after his sleepless night he
had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of Dolokhov, who had
no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.
.
 Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself
somewhere?" passed through his mind.
 But just at moments when such
thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a particularly calm and
absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of the onlookers, "Will it
be long? Are things ready?"

When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,
and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to Pierre.


"I should not be doing my duty, Count," he said in timid tones, "and
should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I
did not tell you the whole truth.
.
.
"

"Oh yes, it is horribly stupid," said Pierre.
 "It's all the same.

Is everything ready?" he added.
 "Only tell me where to go and where to
shoot," he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.
 The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
edge of the clearing.
 For three minutes all had been
ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.


The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to
one another, beginning to see one another through the mist.
 They had the
right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier.

He was pressing one hand to his left side, while the other clutched
his drooping pistol.
 His face was pale.
 Rostov ran toward him and said
something.
 His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his
coat and supported himself with it.
 Dolokhov lowered his head to the
snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself, drew
in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity.
 Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitski
closed their eyes.


Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,
trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:

"Folly.
.
 Rostov was struck by the totally
altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dolokhov's
face.


"Bad! But it's not that, my friend-" said Dolokhov with a gasping voice.

"Where are we? In Moscow, I know.
 I don't matter, but I have killed her,
killed.


"My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother," and Dolokhov
pressed Rostov's hand and burst into tears.

He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her.






CHAPTER VI


Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone.
 Such a storm of feelings,
thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the
room with rapid steps.
 Now he seemed to see her in the early days of
their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on
her face, and then immediately he saw beside her Dolokhov's handsome,
insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and
then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when
he reeled and sank on the snow.
 "In marrying her without loving
her; in deceiving yourself and her.


"But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty
and social tact," thought he; "been proud of my house, in which she
received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty.
 So
this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand
her.
 Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
clear.
 She did not give him the money, but let herself be
kissed.
 Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: 'Let him
do what he pleases,' she used to say of me.
 One day I asked her if she
felt any symptoms of pregnancy.
.
.



    * "You clear out of this.

Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive--live:
tomorrow you'll die as I might have died an hour ago.
 "Why did I tell her that 'Je vous
aime'?" he kept repeating to himself.
 He could not imagine how he could speak to her now.
 Pierre looked
at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds
who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
enemies, he tried to continue reading.
?" stammered Pierre.
.
.
 Hm.


Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange
expression she did not understand, and lay down again.


"Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune," said Helene.


"I'll kill you!" he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her
brandishing the slab.
 He felt the fascination and
delight of frenzy.
 He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down
on her with outstretched hands shouted, "Get out!" in such a terrible
voice that the whole house heard it with horror.



A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left
for Petersburg alone.
 The gazettes from which
the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual
very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians
had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order.


"Your son," wrote Kutuzov, "fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand
and at the head of a regiment--he fell as a hero, worthy of his father
and his fatherland.
 (The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus,
and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel, which
merged in her memory with what followed.

Her eyes grew dim.

She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and
drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.


"Father," she said, "do not turn away from me, let us weep together.
 "Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and
tell Lise.
"

The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
wept.
 It was evident that her eyes did not see
Princess Mary but were looking within.
.
.
 She said nothing but looked about uneasily as
if in search of something.
 She looked at
Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,
and suddenly began to cry.
 He walked
less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day.
 Princess Mary
hoped.
"


    * Fruhstuck: breakfast.
 I'll go.
.
 Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogdanovna.
 (In accordance with Lise's and Prince Andrew's wishes they had
sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any
moment.
"

Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
being carried by.


Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
what was going on in the passage.
 She did
not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting
down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before
the icon stand.
 The old
prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent
Tikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what news.


"Very good!" said the prince closing the door behind him, and Tikhon did
not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.


Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her
luminous eyes fixed on her nurse's wrinkled face (every line of which
she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.


"God is merciful, doctors are never needed," she said.
 She went out on the stairs.
 Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely
softened but agitated expression on his face.


"What a strange fate, Masha darling!" And having taken off his cloak and
felt boots, he went to the little princess' apartment.






CHAPTER IX


The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her
head (the pains had just left her).
"

She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
 His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or
with their relief.
 The pangs began again and Mary Bogdanovna advised
Prince Andrew to leave the room.
 Piteous, helpless, animal moans came
through the door.
 Someone was holding it shut.
 Prince Andrew ran to
the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.
 He could not weep.


His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping
him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
to the godmother, Princess Mary.
 He looked up joyfully at the baby when
the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
the wax with the baby's hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.
 As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties.
 Dolokhov lay ill at his mother's who loved him
passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond of
Rostov for his friendship to her Fedya, often talked to him about her
son.


"Yes, Count," she would say, "he is too noble and pure-souled for
our present, depraved world.
 Few people do understand
him.
 He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!"

Dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostov in a way no
one would have expected of him.
 Yes, dear boy," he continued, "I have met loving,
noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women--countesses
or cooks--who were not venal.
.
 Nicholas brought
many young men to his parents' house.


At that time in the Rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
charming girls.
 She almost quarreled
with her brother about him.
 She insisted that he was a bad man, and
that in the duel with Bezukhov, Pierre was right and Dolokhov wrong, and
further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.
 I don't know how to put it.
.
.
"

Natasha's prediction proved true.


It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible
influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.
 He spent the greater part of his time away
from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.
 "Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That
is the only reality in the world, all else is folly.
"

"If I have time," answered Nicholas.
 And therefore Nicholas' first feeling
on hearing the news was one of anger with Sonya.
.


"And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!" adding, after a pause,
"she told him she loved another.


"Ah, she is indeed a darling! I'll send her to you.


A minute later Sonya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared look.
 This was the first time
since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.
.
.
"

Sonya interrupted him.
.
 If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth.
 I
love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else.
.
.






CHAPTER XII


Iogel's were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow.
 There was
the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves
as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for
the first time.
 With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to
be, pretty--so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.
 Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezukhov's
house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success.
 She
was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone.
 "Look how many charming young
ladies-" He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a
former pupil of his.
 Denisov sat down by the old
ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told
them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young
people dancing, Iogel with Natasha, his pride and his best pupil, were
the first couple.
 Denisov did not take
his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
because he could not.
 In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostov
who was passing:

"This is not at all the thing," he said.
 He is a real dancer, a wonder!" he said.
 He ran up to them.
 He glided silently on one foot half across the
room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them,
when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped
short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his
spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel against his
right, flew round again in a circle.
 Natasha guessed what he meant to
do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how.
 When at
last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew
up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not even make
him a curtsy.
 She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she
did not recognize him.
 Denisov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
with his handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the
rest of the evening.
 Some
twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat between
two candles.
 Rostov had not seen him since his proposal and Sonya's
refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.
 "Thanks for coming.


Dolokhov made no reply.
 "None but fools trust to luck in play," Dolokhov had then
said.


"Or are you afraid to play with me?" Dolokhov now asked as if guessing
Rostov's thought.
 But before he had thought
of anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
deliberately so that everyone could hear:

"Do you remember we had a talk about cards.
.
 'He's a fool who trusts to
luck, one should make certain,' and I want to try.


"I have no money with me," he said.
 Dolokhov "killed," that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov's running.
 "Please
place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.
 So I
ask you to put the money on your cards," replied Dolokhov.
 "Don't stint
yourself, we'll settle afterwards," he added, turning to Rostov.


The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
 He wrote "800 rubles" on a card, but while the waiter
filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake
of twenty rubles.


"Leave it," said Dolokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at
Rostov, "you'll win it back all the sooner.
 Much
depended on Rostov's winning or losing on that seven of hearts.
 Nicholas had replied that it would be
more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take
anything more till the spring.
 Now only twelve hundred rubles was left
of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the
loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his
word.
 Those broad, reddish
hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down
the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.


"Oh, those Moscow gossips!" said Dolokhov, and he took up the cards with
a smile.
 The seven
he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack.
 He had lost
more than he could pay.


The whole interest was concentrated on Rostov.
 In reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles.
 He had fixed on
that number because forty-three was the sum of his and Sonya's joint
ages.
.
.

Wasn't he my friend? Wasn't I fond of him? But it's not his fault.

Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant
to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when Dolokhov,
slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding
up the total of Rostov's debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the
figures in his clear, bold hand.
 "All right!
Twenty-one rubles," he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which
the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up
a pack he prepared to deal.
 Rostov submissively unbent the corner of his
card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote
twenty-one.


"It's all the same to me," he said.
.
 "One does get tired sitting so long," he
added.
U.


"I say, Rostov," said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas
straight in the eyes, "you know the saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky at
cards.
' Your cousin is in love with you, I know.


"Then when am I to have it?"

"Tomorrow," replied Rostov and left the room.
 Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing room.


"Splendid! Excellent!" exclaimed Natasha.


"I am so glad you've come!" said Natasha, without answering him.
 "We are
enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sake!
Did you know?"

"No, Papa is not back yet," said Sonya.
 From the dancing
room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
Natasha to sing.


"What is the matter?" she asked.
"

"Everything's the same with them.


Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.


"Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There's nothing to
be happy about!" thought he.


Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude.
 "Go away? But
where to? It's one--let them sing!"

He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denisov and the girls
and avoiding their eyes.
 She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
 While that untrained
voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was
sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in
it and wished to hear it again.


"What is this?" thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely opened
eyes.
 "What has happened to her? How she is singing today!" And suddenly
the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the
next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats:
"Oh mio crudele affetto.
.
 one, two, three.
.
.
".
.
 but this is
real.
 "What were losses, and
Dolokhov, and words of honor?.
 He got up without saying a word and went
downstairs to his own room.


"Well--had a good time?" said the old count, smiling gaily and proudly
at his son.
 How much?"

"Very much," said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile,
for which he was long unable to forgive himself, "I have lost a little,
I mean a good deal, a great deal--forty three thousand.
.


"Yes, yes," he muttered, "it will be difficult, I fear, difficult to
raise.
.
.


"Mamma!.
.
"

"Made what?"

"Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!" she exclaimed.


"Don't, Natasha! What nonsense!" she said, hoping it was a joke.


"Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact," said Natasha indignantly.


"Well then, what do you want? You're all in love nowadays.

"Good luck to you!"

"No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I suppose I'm not in love with
him.
"

"Well then, accept his offer.
 It's high time for you to be married,"
answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.


"No, Mamma, but I'm so sorry for him.
 I shall speak to him myself," said
the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this little
Natasha as grown up.


He jumped up at the sound of her light step.


"Nataly," he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, "decide my fate.
.
.
.
 She came up to them.


"Countess, I have done w'ong," Denisov went on in an unsteady voice,
"but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I
would give my life twice over.
 He did not wish to stay another day in
Moscow.
 Without undressing,
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.


The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzhok
embroidery came into the room offering their services.
 It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
to get more money from the traveler.

What is bad? What is good? What should one love and what hate? What does
one live for? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power
governs all?"

There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not
a logical answer and not at all a reply to them.
" But
dying was also dreadful.
 "All we can know
is that we know nothing.
 The
stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre.
 The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation.
 His servant
was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.
 When everything was
ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a
tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
he passed it.



    * To indicate he did not want more tea.
 Pierre looked at him.


Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old
eyes attracted him irresistibly.


"I have heard of you, my dear sir," continued the stranger, "and of your
misfortune.
"

Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.
 "You are young
and I am old.
.
.
 do not believe in God,"
said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to
speak the whole truth.


"Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir," said the Mason.
 "You cannot
know Him.
 "Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy
conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst
thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence
of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and
infinite in all His attributes?.
.
 "Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art
wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words," he went
on, with a somber and scornful smile.
.
 For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but
in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
greatness.
 Whether he accepted the wise
reasoning contained in the Mason's words, or believed as a child
believes, in the speaker's tone of conviction and earnestness, or the
tremor of the speaker's voice--which sometimes almost broke--or those
brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness
and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole being (and
which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and
hopelessness)--at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe
and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration,
and return to life.

"I don't understand," he said, "how it is that the mind of man cannot
attain the knowledge of which you speak.
 "Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel
and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I
retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.

How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving
everything from society and giving nothing in return.
 That is what you have
done.


"The exchange horses have just come," answered the servant.
 "Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible
and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,"
thought Pierre.
"

Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to.
.
 But do
not suppose me to be so bad.
.


The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
 "and success.
 For a long while after he had gone,
Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room,
pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning
anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future
that seemed to him so easy.






CHAPTER III


On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival, he
went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a Kempis, whose book
had been sent him by someone unknown.


"I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count," he said without
sitting down.


"One more question, Count," he said, "which I beg you to answer in
all sincerity--not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you
renounced your former convictions--do you believe in God?"

Pierre considered.

His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though
smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.
) "When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
your eyes," added Willarski.
 Once or twice he
shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to take
it off, but let it drop again.
 The five minutes spent with his eyes
bandaged seemed to him an hour.
 Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a
black table on which lay an open book.
 After reading the first words of the Gospel: "In the beginning
was the Word and the Word was with God," Pierre went round the table and
saw a large open box filled with something.
 With bated
breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the
brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was
known).
 Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,
Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
acquaintance--he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.
.
.
 hope.

"Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?"

"No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it," said Pierre,
so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
saying.


"You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue.


"Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
.
 Think this over and I will come to you again.
"

"To combat the evil which sways the world.
.
" Pierre repeated, and a
mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.
 The important mystery mentioned by the
Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,
and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
that was good.


Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon's temple,
which every Freemason should cultivate in himself.
  3.


"I must also inform you," said the Rhetor, "that our Order delivers its
teaching not in words only but also by other means, which may perhaps
have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue
than mere words.
 You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like
method of enlightenment.
 He
listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his
ordeal was about to begin.
.
 When that had been
done, the Rhetor said:

"In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.
"

Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the
Rhetor's instructions.


"That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path
of virtue," said the Mason.


"Women," he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
 Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with
mallets, the doors opened before them.
 The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the
faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several
men standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor's and holding
swords in their hands pointed at his breast.
 On seeing this, Pierre moved
forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it.
"

Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it.

On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna's
two years before.
 There were also present a very distinguished dignitary
and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins'.
 All maintained
a solemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a
mallet in his hand.
 At one
side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon
it, at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a
Testament and a skull.
 Round it stood seven large candlesticks like
those used in churches.


"He must first receive the trowel," whispered one of the brothers.


"Oh, hush, please!" said another.
 And really, the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before.
 Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of
the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.
 Now and then
his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in
imagination a new plan of life.
 "She is living in Moscow and you are here.
 Remember, dear boy,"
and he drew Pierre's arm downwards, "it is simply a misunderstanding.
 Moreover, the words of the Masonic
statutes, "be kindly and courteous," recurred to him.
 He was so used to submitting to Prince Vasili's tone of careless
self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now, but
he also felt that on what he said now his future depended--whether he
would follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively shown
him by the Masons, on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a
new life.
 But the story of the duel, confirmed
by Pierre's rupture with his wife, was the talk of society.
 And when after Pierre's departure Helene returned
to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only
cordially, but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune.

When conversation turned on her husband Helene assumed a dignified
expression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she
did not understand its significance.
 And how has
it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that
has happened.
"

Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
soirees as before--such as she alone had the gift of arranging--at which
was to be found "the cream of really good society, the bloom of the
intellectual essence of Petersburg," as she herself put it.


Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description
of each.
 He was aide-de-camp to a
very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to
Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger.
 He made friends with
and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and
who could therefore be of use to him.
 He liked Petersburg and despised
Moscow.
"

"Ah, my dear vicomte," put in Anna Pavlovna, "L'Urope" (for some
reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French
pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a
Frenchman), "L'Urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere.
"


After that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King
of Prussia, in order to draw Boris into the conversation.
 The greatest attention
of all to Boris' narrative was shown by Helene.


"On Tuesday between eight and nine.


"It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I.
.


"Oh, it's nothing.
.
 It became particularly animated toward the end of the
evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.
.
 Everywhere
one heard curses on Bonaparte, "the enemy of mankind.


In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.
 He was continually traveling through the three provinces
entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe
to cruelty with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself.


Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards.
 But what was still stranger,
though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the
expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel's face, Prince
Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
wife: "Ah, why have you done this to me?"

Soon after Prince Andrew's return the old prince made over to him a
large estate, Bogucharovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.

Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,
partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
his father's peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,
Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo, began building and spent most of
his time there.


"If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought some papers,"
said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child's
little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops
from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.


There were in the room a child's cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a
table, a child's table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was
sitting.


"My dear," said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the
cot where she was standing, "better wait a bit.
 later.
"

"Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
off--and this is what comes of it!" said Prince Andrew in an exasperated
whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.
.


Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass
in hand.
 really.
 I think so.
 These last days, mistrusting their household
doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had
been trying first one remedy and then another.


"Devil take them!" he muttered, and after listening to the verbal
instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
father's letter, he returned to the nursery.
 Karl Ivanich always says that
sleep is more important than anything," whispered Princess Mary with a
sigh.


"Confound you and your Karl Ivanich!" He took the glass with the drops
and again went up to the cot.
 Opening them mechanically he
began reading.
 Have received another letter
about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Petenka--he took part in it--and
it's all true.
 He folded it up
without reading it and reread his father's letter, ending with the
words: "Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions!"

"No, pardon me, I won't go now till the child is better," thought he,
going to the door and looking into the nursery.






CHAPTER IX


Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
self-derision genuinely Russian.
.
 The field marshal grows
impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor
to Count T.
 Then he bursts into one of his wild
furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens
them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others.
'

"'From all my riding,' he writes to the Emperor, 'I have got a saddle
sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my
riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command
to the general next in seniority, Count Buxhowden, having sent him my
whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack
of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one
day's ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all, as
reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmoretzki, and
all that the peasants had has been eaten up.
 After the field marshal's departure it
appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.
 Our aim is no longer, as
it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid
General Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief.
 At last our enemy.
 The Emperor proposes to give all
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear
this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.
 He was seized with
alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
reading the letter.


Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.


"My dear," he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
him.
 He stood over him, gazing at his
head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket.


"I was coming to tell you so.


Prince Andrew looked at his sister.
 Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair
against the muslin of the curtain.






CHAPTER X


Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the
Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with
him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
what he should do on his estates.
 Some of
the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with
alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first
fright were amused by Pierre's lisp and the new words they had not heard
before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the
cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from this
speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.
 He had a dim perception of the
following budget:

About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about
30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,
and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in
pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to
the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts.
 But
he felt that this did not forward matters at all.
 On the other hand, Pierre demanded that
steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by
showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,
and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.
"

Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it.


In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make
his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the
largest landowner of the province.
 Temptations to Pierre's greatest
weakness--the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the
Lodge--were so strong that he could not resist them.
 Instead of the new life he had
hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.


The chief steward, who considered the young count's attempts almost
insane--unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs--made
some concessions.
 Everywhere were receptions,
which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
depth of his heart.
 In one place the peasants presented him with bread
and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,
to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor
of Peter and Paul, his patron saints.
 In another place the women with
infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard
work.
 He did not know that
since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they
did still harder work on their own land.
 He did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and
that the pupils' parents wept at having to let him take their children
and secured their release by heavy payments.
 He did not know that
where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs' payments
had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been
increased by a half.


"How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,"
thought Pierre, "and how little attention we pay to it!"

He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at
receiving it.


The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with
a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.


Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would
happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,
on what he thought right.
 Round the house was a garden newly laid
out.
 The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a
water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,
the bridges were strong and had handrails.


"Well, what is it?" came a sharp, unpleasant voice.


"Ask him to wait," and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.
 They
put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
be talked over at length.
 At last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans
for the future, Pierre's journeys and occupations, the war, and so
on.
 It was as if Prince Andrew would
have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.
 I mean to settle
here altogether next year.
.
 Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and
all you have been doing on your estates.
 Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,
while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future
arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:

"However, this is not at all interesting.


"I was very much surprised when I heard of it," said Prince Andrew.
"

"Forever?" said Prince Andrew.
 Men always did and always will err, and
in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.
 To
live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.
 No, I shall not agree
with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying.


"When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you'll get on with her," he
said.
"

"But what do you mean by living only for yourself?" asked Pierre,
growing excited.
 "And I have
done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done something
toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action,
and more than that, you can't make me believe that you do not think so
yourself.
 And the main thing is," he continued, "that I know, and know
for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure
happiness in life.
 The one and the other may serve as a pastime.
.
 I'm
alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can
without hurting others.
.
 I should be thankful to do nothing,
but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to
choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it.
"

"Why aren't you serving in the army?"

"After Austerlitz!" said Prince Andrew gloomily.
 And I won't--not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk
threatening Bald Hills--even then I wouldn't serve in the Russian army!
Well, as I was saying," he continued, recovering his composure, "now
there's this recruiting.
"

"Then you are serving?"

"I am.
 But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too
energetic a character.
 He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of
the recruiting, granted by the Emperor.
 But it is a good thing
for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves,
stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to
inflict punishments justly and unjustly.
 It is those people I pity, and
for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs.


"So that's what I'm sorry for--human dignity, peace of mind, purity, and
not the serfs' backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may,
always remain the same backs and foreheads.

Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was:
Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of
humanity.


"Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest
is a dream," said Pierre.


Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at
the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.


"A future life?" Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time
to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew
Prince Andrew's former atheistic convictions.

Don't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole?
Don't I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and
higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the
Deity--the Supreme Power if you prefer the term--is manifest? If I see,
clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose
it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel that I
cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I shall
always exist and always have existed.

What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with one's
own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right"
(Prince Andrew's voice trembled and he turned away), "and suddenly that
being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.
 That's
what convinces, that is what has convinced me," said Prince Andrew.
.
 The Someone is--God.


Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
sun gleaming on the blue waters.
 There was perfect stillness.
 Pierre
became silent.
 As they approached the house,
Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre's attention to a commotion going
on at the back porch.
"

"But what are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.


"Andrew!" said Princess Mary, imploringly.
" *


     * "But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to
     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young
     man.
 The old woman, lowering
her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup
upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat
quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.


"I have, good sir," she answered garrulously.
.
 Such a brightness on the face like
the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother's cheek it drops and
drops.
.


"Lord Jesus Christ!" exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.
 "Oh,
don't speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and
said, 'The monks cheat,' and as soon as he'd said it he went blind.
 So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes
up to her and falls down and says, 'Make me whole,' says he, 'and I'll
give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.
 God will punish you," she said
admonishingly, turning to Pierre.


"How did the star get into the icon?" Pierre asked.


Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.


"Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!" she began, her
pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red.
.


"Now, why need you do it?" said Princess Mary.
.

I'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was
such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don't want to come
out, even into the light of heaven again.
 Prince Andrew went
out of the room, and then, leaving "God's folk" to finish their tea,
Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.


"You are very kind," she said to him.
 I understand them so
well and have the greatest respect for them.
"

Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.


"I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a
brother," she said.
 He has not a character
like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows.
 He needs activity, and this quiet regular
life is very bad for him.
 Others don't notice it, but I see it.


"Ah! Very glad! Kiss me," he said, having learned who the young stranger
was.


The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.
 The old prince went up to him and began to talk
business.
.
.
 Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I'll come and sit
with you at supper.
 Make friends with my
little fool, Princess Mary," he shouted after Pierre, through the door.
 That charm was
not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
and with the household.
 They were all fond of him already.
 In April the Pavlograds were stationed immovably for some
weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.
 In the hospitals,
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling
that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able
to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
 That spring a
new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs,
and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root.
 But in spite
of all this, the soldiers of Denisov's squadron fed chiefly on "Mashka's
sweet root," because it was the second week that the last of the
biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the
last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.


The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
half-ruined houses.
 Denisov never spoke of Rostov's family,
but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostov felt
that the elder hussar's luckless love for Natasha played a part in
strengthening their friendship.
 Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostov
to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe
return with evident joy.
 Rostov
brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and
kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering.
 Rostov took the
joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the
officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent a duel.
.
.
 Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut,
dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf.
 The
hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue.

Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron
liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece
of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window.


In April, Rostov was on orderly duty.
 In answer
to Rostov's inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
that he had some business.
 Denisov had not yet returned.
 Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.


"A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!" shouted Denisov
after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing.
 "After all,
can't let our men starve.


The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and holding his
fingers spread out before his eyes said:

"This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won't
begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle
the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign
a receipt for such and such stores received.
 When Rostov asked what was the
matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse,
feeble voice.
 Let them twy me, but I'll
always thwash scoundwels.
 Ice.


The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to
bleed Denisov.
' I go to the commissioner.
.
 Well, I've had a bit of fun I can tell you!" cried
Denisov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing under his black
mustache.
 "I'd have killed him if they hadn't taken him away!"

"But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself," said Rostov.
"

Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed.
 Next day he woke calm and
cheerful.


But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov's and
Denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental commander
in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence.


In answer to Rostov's renewed questions, Denisov said, laughing, that he
thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but
that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear
any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he
would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.
 Rostov, who
felt his friend's absence very much, having no news of him since he
left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denisov
in hospital.


Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
putrefaction and hospital air.
 Only think! I am alone in charge
of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It's well that
the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some
lint each month or we should be lost!" he laughed.


"Major Denisov," Rostov said again.


"Is he tall and with reddish hair?" asked the doctor.


"There was one like that," said the doctor, as if pleased.
 Those who were conscious raised
themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at
Rostov with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy
of another's health.
 Rostov listened and made out the word.


"Good day, your honor!" he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostov and
evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.


"Why, this one seems.
 After all we're men, not
dogs.
 He shall be taken away--taken away at once,"
said the assistant hurriedly.
 "Let us go, your honor.
"

"Yes, yes, let us go," said Rostov hastily, and lowering his eyes and
shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful
envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the room.

Rostov looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.


"See where we've met again!" said the little man.
 "Tushin, Tushin, don't
you remember, who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern? And I've had a bit
cut off, you see.
 He did not ask about the regiment, nor about
the general state of affairs, and when Rostov spoke of these matters did
not listen.
 On
Rostov's inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from
under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
rough draft of his answer to it.
 They say great rewards will
now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted.
.
.
 "What for? If I were a wobber I would
ask mercy, but I'm being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book.

Listen, I'm w'iting to them stwaight.


When the reading of Denisov's virulent reply, which took more than an
hour, was over, Rostov said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in
a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov's hospital comrades, who had
gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their
stories.
 Denisov was moodily silent all the evening.
 In it was
the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which Denisov,
without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply
asked for pardon.


"Hand it in.


Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
Emperors met.
 Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so
that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from
cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,
would now have been surprised had he been absent.


On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinski arranged a
supper for his French friends.
 Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the
presence of French officers in Boris' lodging, dressed in uniforms he
had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from
the outposts of the flank.
 He
stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived
there.


"I've come at a bad time I think.
 His eyes, looking
serenely and steadily at Rostov, seemed to be veiled by something, as if
screened by blue spectacles of conventionality.
 So it seemed to Rostov.


"Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!" said Boris, and he
led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced
him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar
officer, and an old friend of his.
 N.
--le Capitaine S.
," said he,
naming his guests.
 The looks
the visitors cast on him seemed to say: "And what is he sitting here
for?" He rose and went up to Boris.
 I think it would be best not to bring it before the
Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.
.






CHAPTER XX


Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
Denisov's behalf.
 The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross
of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St.
 That's
settled," thought Nicholas.
.
.
 And passing
people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the
Emperor's house.


"Whom do you want?" someone inquired.


"What is it? A petition?"

"What is it?" asked the person in the other room.


"Another petitioner," answered the man with the braces.


"Tell him to come later.
 later! Tomorrow.
 It's too late.
.


"Are you an officer?"

"Lieutenant Count Rostov.
.
.


It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor's special favor
during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in
which Rostov was serving.
 The
gentlemen of the Emperor's suite ran down the stairs and went to their
horses.
 Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the
Emperor's horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rostov knew at once
was heard on the stairs.
.
 He spoke a few words to
some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of Rostov's
division, smiled and beckoned to him.

Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom
was Rostov) moved nearer to the Emperor.
 Andrew ribbon over his shoulder.
 He was riding
a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
saddlecloth.


"Lazarev!" the colonel called, with a frown, and Lazarev, the first
soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.
 His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called
before the ranks.


The Emperors remounted and rode away.
 A rumble of Russian and French
voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.
"

"Here's a cap, lads!" shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier, donning a shaggy
French cap.
 It has to be done.
 Terrible doubts rose in his soul.
 Next he thought of that
self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an
Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander.


The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to
eat before going away.
 He finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself.


"We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more," he
went on.
 If the Emperor
pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance
with him, it means that that is the right thing to do.


"Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That's
all.






CHAPTER XXII


In 1809 the intimacy between "the world's two arbiters," as Napoleon
and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared war on
Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our
old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and in
court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of
Alexander's sisters was spoken of.


On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborers--this being one of the first examples of
the kind in Russia.
 On other estates the serfs' compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent.
 The other half he spent in
"Bogucharovo Cloister," as his father called Prince Andrew's estate.
 In the forest it was
almost hot, no wind could be felt.
 The
coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter.

But apparently the coachman's sympathy was not enough for Peter, and he
turned on the box toward his master.
 Probably ten times the age of
the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice
as tall as they.
 During this journey he, as
it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,
restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything
anew--but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and not
disturbing himself or desiring anything.
 It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
bathe.


During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by his
elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old count's
house was crowded on account of an approaching name day), Prince Andrew
repeatedly glanced at Natasha, gay and laughing among the younger
members of the company, and asked himself each time, "What is she
thinking about? Why is she so glad?"

That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep.
 As soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst
into the room.
 He heard female voices overhead.


"I won't, I can't sleep, what's the use? Come now for the last time.


"Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there's an end of it.
 Everything was stone-still,
like the moon and its light and the shadows.
.
.
 "To bed then,
if it must be!" and she slammed the casement.
 "There she is again! As if it were on
purpose," thought he.


The whole day had been hot.
 The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,
the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely
swayed by the breeze.
 "But where is it?" he again wondered, gazing at the left
side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration
at the very oak he sought.


"Yes, it is the same oak," thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was
seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal.
 Austerlitz with
the lofty heavens, his wife's dead reproachful face, Pierre at the
ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night
itself and the moon, and.
 After that journey
to Ryazan he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer
interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,
went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face.

And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly
cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.
"

"If it were hot," Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly
to his sister, "he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he must
wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose.
 The courtiers explained
the Emperor's neglect of him by His Majesty's displeasure at Bolkonski's
not having served since 1805.
 A few days later
Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of
War, Count Arakcheev.



On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev's waiting
room at nine in the morning.


He did not know Arakcheev personally, had never seen him, and all he had
heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.
"

Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,
scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red
nose.


"What is your petition?" asked Arakcheev.


"I am not petitioning, your excellency," returned Prince Andrew quietly.
 "Prince Bolkonski?"

"I am not petitioning about anything.
.


"I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
committee.
 I do not approve of it," said Arakcheev, rising and taking a
paper from his writing table.
 "Here!" and he handed it to Prince Andrew.
.
.
 And this movement of
reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speranski
its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question
of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
consciousness.

The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,
turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
reforms, simply because he was the son of his father.
 People talked about
him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.
 He has promised to
come this evening.


"Afraid of being late.
.
 The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross
suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast.
 As happens to some people, especially to men
who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting
anyone new--especially anyone whom, like Speranski, he knew by
reputation--expected to discover in him the perfection of human
qualities.
 I had heard of you, as
everyone has," he said after a pause.


Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Speranski rose
and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the
room.
"

"No," said Prince Andrew, "my father did not wish me to take advantage
of the privilege.
 He did not like to agree with him in everything and
felt a wish to contradict.


"Grounds of personal ambition maybe," Speranski put in quietly.


"And of state interest to some extent," said Prince Andrew.


"What do you mean?" asked Speranski quietly, lowering his eyes.



    * "If you regard the question from that point of view.
"

"I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges
have attained the same end," returned Prince Andrew.
 But he was so busy for
whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
of nothing.


As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey's, Speranski produced
a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he
received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to him long and
confidentially.


To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in
Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
man.
 Moreover, Speranski, either because he
appreciated the other's capacity or because he considered it necessary
to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption
that one's companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
and profundity of one's own ideas.
" or: "They cannot understand this.
) He would transfer a
question to metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time,
and thought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again
descend to the level of the original discussion.


During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a
passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
Bonaparte.

That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in these
times!"

Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
needed which he did not possess.
 At Speranski's
request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up
and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the Institutes of Justinian,
he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.

He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
Petersburg.


Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at
the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.

At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
closer bound he involuntarily became to the order.
 Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master
of the principal lodge.
 And so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.
" Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.


"At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching alone
was of course sufficient.
 It is
now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue
a charm palpable to those senses.
 He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the
usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.
 Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then
was, this was not even unpleasant to him.
 Nothing mattered to him.
 This is what he noted in his diary:


Moscow, 17th November

I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what
I have experienced.
 (2) The
purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The
improvement of the human race by striving for such purification.
 Only to this aim can we always strive independently
of circumstances.
 On this ground
Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
depth of my soul I agreed with him.
 He
advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but
to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while
diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path
self-knowledge and self-perfecting.
 Besides this he advised me for
myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end
he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will
in future note down all my actions.



Petersburg, 23rd November

I am again living with my wife.
 In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice
to seek.
 Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do.
 That is what I decided, and
what I wrote to Joseph Alexeevich.
 Napoleon himself
had noticed her in the theater and said of her: "C'est un superbe
animal.
 Pierre during
the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his
wife's circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,
indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired
artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect.


"What a strange antipathy," thought Pierre, "yet I used to like him very
much.
 I ate and drank
moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.
 On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth.
 I began to
criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor's words--that
a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid
is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist.
 My tongue
is my enemy.
 and O.
 Then our talk turned to the
interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven
sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the
Holy Spirit.
 The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the
magnificence of the spectacle.

I could not be eloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the
Brothers and to the Grand Master.
 Elohim
is the name of the ruler of all.
 Human sciences dissect
everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it.
 I wished to meditate, but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when Dolokhov,
meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence.
 Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy
came and began relating various adventures.
 His coming vexed me from the
first, and I said something disagreeable to him.
 The cause of this is my egotism.
 Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
thigh with its teeth and would not let go.
 Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began
biting me.
 I looked round and saw Brother A.
 But
as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,
and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,
but so softly that I could not hear it.
 And he said, "Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do
you know it? I think you know it already.
 To
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one's embraces and
gave me to understand that that was my duty.
 And in my dream I knew that these drawings
represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved.
 And I
seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation
of the Song of Songs.
 Country neighbors from
Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Peronskaya a
maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, and the son of their district postmaster
who had obtained a post in Petersburg.
 He
narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had
obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.


In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself.
 He had picked
up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near
the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander.
 Just as he had
done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and
so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also.



    * "That girl shall be my wife.
 Moreover, the Rostovs' affairs were seriously embarrassed, as
the suitor could not but know; and above all, Vera was twenty-four, had
been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking
and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her.


"And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.
.

In the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and
constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved Vera
sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands.
 The old
count felt this most.
 He would probably have been unable to state
the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his
affairs.
 Nor had
he any money.
 A few days before
the wedding Berg entered the count's study early one morning and, with
a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him
know what Vera's dowry would be.
 "I like your being businesslike about it.
.
 I
like it.
.
.
 "Or at least twenty thousand, Count," he added, "and then a
note of hand for only sixty thousand.


Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
Rostovs.


Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he did not wish to see her, and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
of him.


"Nowadays old friends are not remembered," the countess would say when
Boris was mentioned.


He drove to their house in some agitation.
 The memory of Natasha was his
most poetic recollection.


"Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?" asked the
countess.


Natasha sat down and, without joining in Boris' conversation with the
countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood's suitor.


Boris' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion.

He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
 After his first visit Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted
him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling,
because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to
his career, while to renew their former relations without intending to
marry her would be dishonorable.

she could not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never
let her marry him.
 But he failed to do so and felt awkward about
entering on such an explanation.
 It seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love
with Boris as of old.
 The countess--her prayerful mood dispelled--looked
round and frowned.
.
 In her behavior to her mother
Natasha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.
.


"About Boris.

"Tell me, Mamma! He's nice?"

"Natasha, you are sixteen.
 At your age I was married.
 But what then?.
"

"Why not?" said Natasha, without changing her position.


"Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation.

and because you yourself don't love him.
 It is not right, darling!"

 "But if I want to.
.
.
" said Natasha.
.
"

Natasha did not let her finish.
 Speak, Mamma, why don't you say anything? Speak!" said she,
turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in
that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say.
 He may already have found a suitable and
wealthy match, and now he's half crazy.


"I'll tell you some things about myself.
 I had a cousin.
.
"

"How can you know? No, Mamma, don't speak to him! What nonsense!" said
Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.
 "Not to marry, but just so," she added.


"How so, my pet?"

"Just so.
 "You're shaking the whole bed!
You're awfully like me, just such another giggler.
.
.
 "But, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you think? Was
anybody ever so much in love with you? And he's very nice, very, very
nice.
.
.
"

"You flirt with him too," said the countess, laughing.


"No, he is a Freemason, I have found out.
.
 The
diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.


"The Emperor?.
 No, a minister.
.
.
.
" was whispered among the crowd.


There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that the
dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged as
it should be.


Natasha was going to her first grand ball.


"That's not the way, that's not the way, Sonya!" cried Natasha turning
her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who
was dressing it had not time to release.
 "That bow is not right.
 "You won't do it right.
"

"But it's already ten.


The cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, which was too long.
.
 Peronskaya must be tired of waiting.


"Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!" cried Natasha, as she stood in
the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.


"Say what you like," exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing voice as she
looked at Natasha, "say what you like, it's still too long.
"

Natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass.
.

But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
 In spite of her age and plainness she had
gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with less flurry--for
to her it was a matter of routine.
 She had washed behind her
ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing room in her
yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old lady's maid
was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs' servants had been.






CHAPTER XV


Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
had time to think of what lay before her.
 She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping
over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her
fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in front of her mother, mounted the
brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers.
 She could not assume that pose, which would have made her
ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
with all her might to conceal it.


Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
from the others.
"


The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black
hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess' eye involuntarily
rested longer on the slim Natasha.
 She looked at her and gave her alone
a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess.


In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
the Emperor.
 Natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about
her and looking at her.
 they say Prince--is quite mad
about her.


"She is a splendid match, a millionairess," said Peronskaya.
 "You remember, he stayed a night
with us at Otradnoe.
"

"Oh, you know him?" said Peronskaya.
 "I can't bear him.
"


    * "He is all the rage just now.
.
 Then the crowd hastily retired from
the drawing-room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the
hostess.
 A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,
asking them to move aside.
 Some ladies, with faces betraying complete
forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the
detriment of their toilets.
 The men began to choose partners and take
their places for the polonaise.


Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
music.
 More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking
up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the polonaise.
"

The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable
time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha's ears.
 Peronskaya had left them.
 Boris passed them twice and each time turned away.
 The Emperor
looked smilingly down the room.
 But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.


Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.
 Ask her,"
he said.
 The
despairing, dejected expression of Natasha's face caught his eye.


"I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess
remembers me," said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
belying Peronskaya's remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Natasha
he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his
invitation.
 He asked her to waltz.
 Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his
day and Natasha danced exquisitely.
 He
reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe avenue, and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her.


"I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm tired; but you see how they
keep asking me, and I'm glad of it, I'm happy and I love everybody, and
you and I understand it all," and much, much more was said in her smile.
.
 Such as
she are rare here," he thought, as Natasha, readjusting a rose that was
slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.
 She was at that height of bliss when one becomes
completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.
 He was gloomy and absent-minded.


On her way to supper Natasha passed him.

She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
happiness.


"How can people be dissatisfied with anything?" thought Natasha.






CHAPTER XVIII


Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell
on it long.
 "Yes, that
little Rostova is very charming.
" That was all he
thought about yesterday's ball, and after his morning tea he set to
work.
 Hardly
had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew's room with a
preoccupied air and at once began talking.
 A very
simple thought occurred to him: "What does it matter to me or to Bitski
what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me
any happier or better?"

And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
Andrew had felt in the impending reforms.
 There were no ladies present except Speranski's little
daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess.
 The other
guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and Stolypin.
 While still in the
anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato
laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage.
 Someone--it sounded like
Speranski--was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha.
 Speranski, wearing
a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance.
 When Prince Andrew entered the room
Magnitski's words were again crowned by laughter.
 Stolypin gave a deep
bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese.
.


Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment,
regret, and disillusionment.
 It seemed to him that this was not
Speranski but someone else.

Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned.
 Stolypin, stuttering, broke into the
conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of things--threatening to give a serious turn
to the conversation.
 Magnitski starting quizzing Stolypin about his
vehemence.
 But their gaiety seemed to Prince
Andrew mirthless and tiresome.


He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could
not jest with them.
 And that gesture, too,
seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
 Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent
the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had
no connection with the previous conversation.
 He
recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project
of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they
were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor
one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor.
 He thought
of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member.
 Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a
pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
 The whole family, whom he had formerly judged
severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly
people.
.
 The chief reason was a sudden, vivid
sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and
illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he,
and even she, was.
 He decided that he must attend
to his son's education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his
charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad, and see
England, Switzerland and Italy.
 Let the dead bury their dead,
but while one has life one must live and be happy!" thought he.






CHAPTER XX


One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him.
 We shall have supper, Count.
" (Berg measured his life not by years
but by promotions.
"

Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and
paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man's dignity,
what it was ein Mann zu sein.
 * Vera at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
same understood life wrongly, as according to Vera all men did.


"Yes," answered Vera, "I don't at all want that.
"

"Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this," said Berg, pointing to
the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.


Just then Count Bezukhov was announced.
 Husband and wife glanced at one
another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming
the honor of this visit.


Before long Boris, Berg's old comrade, arrived.
 There was a shade of
condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera.
 After
Boris came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the
Rostovs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
evening parties.


"What's the matter with her?" thought Pierre, glancing at her.
 After playing
out a whole suit and to his partner's delight taking five tricks,
Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the
room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at Natasha.


"What has happened to her?" he asked himself with still greater
surprise.
 She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
again become what she had been at the ball.


"Something very important is happening between them," thought Pierre,
and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him
neglect the game.
 Natasha on one side was talking with
Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle smile was saying something to
Prince Andrew.


"Yes, that is true, Prince.
" This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince
Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise, but Vera
continued with a still more subtle smile:

"I think no one has been more courted than she," she went on, "but till
quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone.


Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
.
 * Don't you think so?"


    * "Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
.
.


But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
the affairs in Spain.


Berg was satisfied and happy.

Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle talk, the cards, the general
raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea cakes;
only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
parties he wished to imitate.
 Not only in
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natasha, but in the
whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
bound to happen.
 "Only I
feel afraid in his presence.
.


"And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while
we are here.

It is fate.
"

"What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them.
.


At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him
of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.
 Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and
struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.


Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
and had made desperate efforts to combat it.
 He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,
and about Natasha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him
insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?
presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic
labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him.
 Toward
midnight, after he had left the countess' apartments, he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction
of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke, when someone came in.
.
.
.
 she is a rare girl.
.
 My dear friend, I entreat you,
don't philosophize, don't doubt, marry, marry, marry.
"

"But what of her?"

"She loves you.
 "It is not at all the same feeling
that I knew in the past.
.
"

"I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault.
"

"Yes, yes," Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched and
sad expression in his eyes.
 The brighter Prince Andrew's lot appeared to
him, the gloomier seemed his own.
 He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his
life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already
ending.
" With his son, however,
he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and,
adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.
 "Fourthly and finally," the
father said, looking ironically at his son, "I beg you to put it off for
a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for a German
tutor for Prince Nicholas.
" concluded the prince, in a tone which showed that
nothing would make him alter his decision.


Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or
his fiancee's, would not stand a year's test, or that he (the old
prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his
father's wish--to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.
 And I am afraid of him; I have
now become quite calm, quite calm.
 "What's the good of making so much of it? Things are nice as
it is," she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the room,
not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each
step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of
shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe
as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice.
.
 to be tormented? What am I to do?.
.


Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not
mistaken.


The countess' face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.


"Your offer.
.
 She wished to love him as a
son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man.


"It is true that Natasha is still young, but--so long as that?.
.
.
.
"

"Go, go to him.
 "Go.
 go," said the mother, sadly and
reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.


"I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you.


Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
in his heart his former love for her.


"Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?" asked Prince
Andrew, still looking into her eyes.
"

Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take
in the meaning of his words.


"Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be," continued Prince
Andrew, "it will give you time to be sure of yourself.
" said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.


"In a year you will learn to know yourself.


"It's awful! Oh, it's awful! awful!" Natasha suddenly cried, and again
burst into sobs.
 "I am
so happy.
 He came every day to the Rostovs',
but did not behave to Natasha as an affianced lover: he did not use
the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand.
 Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as
yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite
different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere.
 Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it.
.
"

Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask his
advice about Petya's education or Nicholas' service.
 She asked herself in perplexity: "What does he
look for in me? He is trying to discover something by looking at me!
What if what he seeks in me is not there?" Sometimes she fell into one
of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and then she particularly
loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed.
 He was talking to the countess,
and Natasha sat down beside a little chess table with Sonya, thereby
inviting Prince Andrew to come too.
.
"

"What can happen?"

"Whatever trouble may come," Prince Andrew continued, "I beg you,
Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for
advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he
has a heart of gold.
 She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed
her hand for the last time.
 "Don't go!" she said in a tone that made him
wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long
afterwards.






CHAPTER XXV


During that year after his son's departure, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's
health and temper became much worse.
 He grew still more irritable, and
it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits
of unprovoked anger.
 Or, turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in
Princess Mary's presence how she liked our village priests and icons and
would joke about them.
" All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear
and simple law--the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who
lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God.
 She felt that something had happened to him, but he said
nothing to her about his love.
 Before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his
departure they were dissatisfied with one another.



Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.


Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your
excellent mother.
 Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother
had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged
anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to
die.
 As a
young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so
as a mother.
 But not to speak of
her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief.
 This irritability is, as
you know, chiefly directed to political questions.


Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew's
absence.
 I do not think
he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it.
 He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her
father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt
of his displeasure without attaining her object.
 My father
then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of
that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever.
 If the
doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia, but
as it is I have to postpone my return for three months.
 I have been and
always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse his
anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time, would
destroy half my happiness.
"

After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the
letter to her father.
.
 A good family!.
 Perhaps you will go and
live with him too?" he added, turning to Princess Mary.


"Why shouldn't I marry her?" he asked his daughter.
 And they all struggled
and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls, their
eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an
instant.
 Once, when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself.
 Under guise of a present for the
pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim's complete costume for
herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.

Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,
Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to
put her project into execution.
.
 He felt that
sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts with
stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with Sonya's
love and his promise to her.
 It was all dreadfully difficult and
complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters in
French, beginning: "My dear Mamma," and ending: "Your obedient son,"
which said nothing of when he would return.
 She wrote that if he did not come and take
matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they
would all have to go begging.


The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate
to go home on leave.
 Why he had to go he did not know; but after his
after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious
gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when
he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka
(Denisov's servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who
turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
home.
 A week later he
obtained his leave.
 What was new in them
was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to
be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state of
their affairs.

She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned, and the
faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him.

Petya and Natasha surprised Nicholas most.
 Petya was a big handsome
boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was
already breaking.
 As for Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and
laughed whenever he looked at her.


"You're not the same at all," he said.


"How? Am I uglier?"

"On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!" he whispered to her.
 This amazed
Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski's courtship skeptically.


"You see he writes," said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
Andrew's, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to
a daughter's future married happiness, "he writes that he won't come
before December.
 But
what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the
frightened and bewildered Mitenka.
.
 I'll hack the dog to pieces! I'm not
my father!.
.


The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on her son.
"

"I knew," thought Nicholas, "that I should never understand anything in
this crazy world.
 "No, I beg you to attend to the
business.
 I am old.
 There was a smell of
decaying leaves and of dog.
 Milka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch
with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched her
hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked
him right on his nose and mustache.


"O-hoy!" came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman's call which
unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round the corner
came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray, wrinkled old
man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian fashion, a
long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence and scorn of
everything that is only seen in huntsmen.


"What orders, your excellency?" said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep
as a proto-deacon's and hoarse with hallooing--and two flashing black
eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent.


"It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?" asked Nicholas,
scratching Milka behind the ears.
 They were
howling there.
)

"We ought to go, don't you think so?" said Nicholas.
"

"Yes, sir.
"

"'No barrier bars a Russian's path'--we'll go!" shouted Petya.


"But you can't.


They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and
whippers-in.
 As soon as they had passed the
fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,
along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert.
 The misty sky still
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air
was still, warm, and silent.
.
" (He was
a distant relative of the Rostovs', a man of small means, and their
neighbor.
 That's it! Come on!" (This was "Uncle's" favorite
expression.
.
 She was followed by Petya
who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom
appointed to look after her.


"Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew me," said Natasha,
referring to her favorite hound.


"You mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, Uncle," she said.
 Rostov, having finally settled
with "Uncle" where they should set on the hounds, and having shown
Natasha where she was to stand--a spot where nothing could possibly run
out--went round above the ravine.
 Having straightened his coat and fastened
on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,
and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray, like himself.
 Count Ilya Rostov, though not at
heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to
the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,
settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked
about with a smile.
 Some hundred paces farther along
the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count's other groom, a daring
horseman and keen rider to hounds.


He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive.
.
"

"To search far.
.
 He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning
finger at his master.
.
" he
whispered, "straight to the Lyadov uplands.
 His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
carried far beyond out into the open field.


After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the
sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in
the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it
was with this that Daniel's voice was heard calling ulyulyu.


The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet
lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.
.


"Blast you!" he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the count.
.
 He was galloping round by the
bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head
the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.
 He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had
separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and
that something had gone wrong.
 He expected the wolf to come his way any
moment.
 "What would it be to Thee to do this for
me?" he said to God.
 "I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask
this of Thee, but for God's sake do let the old wolf come my way and
let Karay spring at it--in sight of 'Uncle' who is watching from over
there--and seize it by the throat in a death grip!" A thousand times
during that half-hour Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the
edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen
undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and "Uncle's" cap
just visible above the bush on his right.
 "Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I
want only that!" thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the
left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of
note in the cries of the dogs.
 The
height of happiness was reached--and so simply, without warning, or
noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his eyes and remained
in doubt for over a second.
 Suddenly the wolf's whole
physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never
seen before--human eyes fixed upon her--and turning her head a little
toward Rostov, she paused.
" the wolf seemed to say to
herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.
 Nearer and nearer.


The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang impetuously
at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but immediately jumped
aside in terror.


"She'll get away! No, it's impossible!" thought Nicholas, still shouting
with a hoarse voice.


"Karay, ulyulyu!.
.
 But the quickness of the wolf's lope and the
borzoi's slower pace made it plain that Karay had miscalculated.

There was still hope.
.
.
 With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to dismount
and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that
mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully.
 As a
result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
stopped a second time by "Uncle's" borzois.


Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
it were a flail.


With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying
and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her
to the place where they were all to meet.
 When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
yet simply at everybody.


"Oh, what a formidable one!" said he.


"Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!" said the count.
 At midday
they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.


Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush.
.


"What's this?" thought Nicholas.
 "Where's that huntsman from? He is not
'Uncle's' man.
 One of his eyes was black,
but he probably was not even aware of it.
 Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste
of this?.
.


The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,
surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
 He
rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
enemy.


Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,
accompanied by two hunt servants.


Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and courteous
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count's
acquaintance.
 Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
greetings, she rode up to them.


To expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to come to
an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and
which, he said, swarmed with hares.


The way to Iligin's upland was across the fields.
 The masters rode together.
 "So in
your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?" he went on,
continuing the conversation they had begun.
 "That
black-spotted one of yours is fine--well shaped!" said he.
.
"

"Of course not!"

"Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches
something.


The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off
on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the
gentlefolk, also moved away.
 The hare they had started was a strong and swift one.
 He had been lying in the stubble,
but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft.

The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the
nearest, were the first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far
before Ilagin's red-spotted Erza passed them, got within a length, flew
at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking
she had seized him, rolled over like a ball.
 That's it, come on!" said he, panting and looking wrathfully
around as if he were abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies
and had insulted him, and only now had he at last succeeded in
justifying himself.
.
.
 "You've deserved it, that's it, come on!"

"She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down three times by herself,"
said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he
were heard or not.


"But what is there in running across it like that?" said Ilagin's groom.
 A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for a
trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to "Uncle's" house.
.
.
 See, she's got a little hunting horn!"

"Goodness gracious! See her knife?.

Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the
sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth.
 Leading from the study
was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen.


After a while "Uncle" came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and
small top boots.


"That's right, young countess, that's it, come on! I never saw anyone
like her!" said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and, with
a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that had been
cut short.
 "She's ridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever!"

Soon after "Uncle's" reappearance the door was opened, evidently from
the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman
of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a
large loaded tray.
 She went
to the table, set down the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly
took from it the bottles and various hors d'oeuvres and dishes and
arranged them on the table.
 How could one
help understanding? Not only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood
the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that
slightly puckered his lips when Anisya Fedorovna entered.
 On the tray
was a bottle of herb wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms,
rye cakes made with buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and
sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey
sweets.
 Anisya Fedorovna left the room.
 Natasha felt so lighthearted and
happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would
come for her too soon.
.
.
 Then why harm anyone?"

"Uncle's" face was very significant and even handsome as he said this.
.
 Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balalayka
to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations.
 "Uncle" sat
listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side.
 The air was
repeated a hundred times.


"You like listening?" she said to Natasha, with a smile extremely like
"Uncle's.
"

"Do you play then?" asked Natasha.


"Uncle" did not answer, but smiled.
"

Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her
errand and brought back the guitar.
 He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching
his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at
Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then
quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not
My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street.
 Something seemed to be laughing
a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as
the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as
he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap.
 "Nicholas, Nicholas!"
she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: "What is it moves me
so?"

Nicholas too was greatly pleased by "Uncle's" playing, and "Uncle"
played the piece over again.


"Uncle" rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of them
smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck a
naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.


Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigree
French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit
and obtained that manner which the pas de chale * would, one would have
supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were
those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that "Uncle" had expected
of her.



She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,
that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she
watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was in
Anisya and in Anisya's father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian
man and woman.


"Oh?" said "Uncle" in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natasha, who
nodded her head with a happy smile.


"And such a one!" she said.
 But as soon as she had said it a new train
of thoughts and feelings arose in her.
 Where is he now?" she thought, and her face
suddenly became serious.
 But this lasted only a second.
 "Don't dare
to think about it," she said to herself, and sat down again smilingly
beside "Uncle," begging him to play something more.



"Uncle" sang as peasants sing, with full and naive conviction that the
whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of
itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists
only to give measure to the words.
 Natasha was in
ecstasies over "Uncle's" singing.
 The count and
countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of
the men.


Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
traps.
 "You're not cold?"

"No.
 I feel so comfortable!" answered
Natasha, almost perplexed by her feelings.
 They remained silent a long
while.
 "Well, you see, first I thought
that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he
would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his
manner.
 Well, and
you?"

"I? Wait a bit, wait.
"

"I know, I expect you thought of him," said Nicholas, smiling as Natasha
knew by the sound of his voice.
" "And then I was saying to myself all the way, 'How well Anisya
carried herself, how well!'" And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy,
ringing laughter.
 These were all their own people who had settled down
in the house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it
seemed, obliged to live in the count's house.
 Such were Dimmler the
musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his family, Belova,
an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many others such as
Petya's tutors, the girls' former governess, and other people who simply
found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count's house
than at home.
 Karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and
everything depend on her daughter's inclination.


At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow
during the holidays to amuse himself.
 It is your
happiness I wish for," she added, feeling that she was telling an
untruth and was becoming entangled.
 "Am I to
sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could
speak so to me.
"

Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the
conversation with him about marriage.
 The
kindhearted countess was the more vexed with Sonya because that poor,
dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to
her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and unselfishly in
love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for finding fault with
her.


Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home.
 The old count was resting in his
study.


She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then
went into the maids' room.
"

On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a samovar,
though it was not at all the time for tea.
 He distrusted the order and asked
whether the samovar was really wanted.


"Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers," answered the buffoon.


"Petya! Petya!" she called to him.
 She sat behind
the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the
pantry door and listened to herself and pondered.
 She was in a mood for
brooding on the past.
 "Where were you
going?" she asked.
 "And
where's Nicholas?"

"Asleep, I think.
"

"Sonya, go and wake him," said Natasha.
 The servants stood round the table--but Prince Andrew
was not there and life was going on as before.
 The thought has come into my
mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all die.
 and suddenly I felt so depressed.
.
 And I was innocent--that was the
chief thing," said Natasha.
 I had a funny doll then and wanted to give
it to you.
 Even now I don't know whether there really was a Negro, or if
we only dreamed it or were told about him.
.


"If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?" said Nicholas.


"Why is it hard to imagine eternity?" said Natasha.
"

"Natasha! Now it's your turn.
 "Why are you sitting there like conspirators?"

"Mamma, I don't at all want to," replied Natasha, but all the same she
rose.


"Ah, Countess," he said at last, "that's a European talent, she has
nothing to learn--what softness, tenderness, and strength.
.
 The young people had
disappeared.
 A clown was Dimmler.
"

But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all
these last days.
 The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the
middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,
and threw it up.


Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others
moved noisily, their runners squeaking.


"How light it is, Nicholas!" came Sonya's voice.


"Gee up, my darlings!" shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one side
and flourishing the whip.
 Nicholas looked back.


Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was already
covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.


"I think this used to be Natasha," thought Nicholas, "and that was
Madame Schoss, but perhaps it's not, and this Circassian with the
mustache I don't know, but I love her.


They did not answer but began to laugh.
 And if this is really
Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
have come to Melyukovka," thought Nicholas.






CHAPTER XI


Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova, a broadly built, energetic woman wearing
spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded by
her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull.
 They were
quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax
figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and voices of
new arrivals in the vestibule.


"Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And Natasha! See whom she looks
like! She really reminds me of somebody.


Natasha, the young Melyukovs' favorite, disappeared with them into the
back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
behind the door.
 Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the mummers, admired
their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they suited the
young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained her so
well.


"Tell what happened to the young lady!" said the second Melyukov girl.


"Well," began the old maid, "a young lady once went out, took a cock,
laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down.
 After sitting a
while, she suddenly hears someone coming.
 did he speak?"

"Yes, like a man.
 Then he
caught her up.
.
.
.


Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even
brighter than before.
 The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was
gay.
 He knew Sonya would pass
that way.
 His bosom
seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.
 She was only a couple of paces
away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she
had known and always slightly feared.
.
 Nicholas!".
 What a heart she has,
Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy while
Sonya was not," continued Natasha.
"

"No, wait a bit.
 Oh, how funny you look!" cried Nicholas, peering
into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and
bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before.
"

"Had I seen her before as she is now," thought Nicholas, "I should long
ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me, and
all would have been well.

Mamma said she was angling for you.
 How could she say such a thing! I
nearly stormed at Mamma.
 Then he jumped down
and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh.


"Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.
.


With Sonya's help and the maid's, Natasha got the glass she held into
the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious
expression and she sat silent.
 She sat a long time looking at the
receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from
tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that
last dim, indistinctly outlined square.

She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.
.


"Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something," whispered Dunyasha; "while
you do nothing but laugh.
"

Sonya heard this and Natasha's whisper:

"I know she will.
"

For about three minutes all were silent.


"Of course she will!" whispered Natasha, but did not finish.


"Did you see? Did you? What was it?" exclaimed Natasha, holding up the
looking glass.
.
.
.


"No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he
turned to me.
"

"After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and
red.
 Nicholas, for the first time,
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love
for him, she would not give way.
 Coldly, without looking at her son,
she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to
inform him of the facts, in her son's presence, but unable to restrain
herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room.
 In all his encounters with his son, the count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya.


The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,
but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, with a cruelty
neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch
Nicholas and for ingratitude.
.


"Mamma darling, it's not at all so.
.


"Nicholas, I'll explain to you.


The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter's breast,
while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.


After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more
depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.
 But the countess' health obliged them to delay their
departure from day to day.
 The thought that her best days, which she would have employed
in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage to anyone,
tormented her incessantly.
 The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt.
 She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which
she attached no importance herself, and in the rough copies of which the
countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.
 Natasha's
trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold.


So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sonya and
Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife who now
enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance with all
Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.
 And this
life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome.
 He ceased keeping
a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going to the Club
again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch with the bachelor
sets, leading such a life that the Countess Helene thought it necessary
to speak severely to him about it.

For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,
merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of
the old Russian type.


When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.

At balls he danced if a partner was needed.
 "Il est charmant; il
n'a pas de sexe," * they said of him.



    * "He is charming; he has no sex.
 But perhaps all these
comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a
path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of
circumstances, society, and race--by that elemental force against which
man is powerless--to the condition I am in," said he to himself in
moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his
comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.
 "I understand
the deception and confusion," he thought, "but how am I to tell them
all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they too in the
depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see
it.
 He frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought
pictures, engaged in building, and above all--read.
 He showed marked signs of
senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent
events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which
he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition.
 She
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married.
 She was surrounded by young
men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.
 But what distressed the princess most of all was her father's
irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late
amounted to cruelty.
.


Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
served first.
.
 And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or
would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,
or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head
sink over his plate.
 He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but
as an equal.


Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
Mademoiselle Bourienne's advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
had grown accustomed to him.
 Metivier came to see the prince about twice
a week.
 He had
been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
understood himself.



At first she heard only Metivier's voice, then her father's, then both
voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and
on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Metivier
with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and
fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
downwards.


"No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand
it! I cannot endure any more," he said, and left the room.
 Nicholas' Day, and
Rostopchin had replied that he could not come:

"On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
Nicholas Bolkonski.
.
 The guests were reluctant to address her,
feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation.
 The tone of the conversation was such as
indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
world.
.
" Count Rostopchin paused, feeling that he had reached the
limit beyond which censure was impossible.


He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor
of being presented to the Duke.


There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared
his throat to draw attention.


"Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The figure
cut by the new French ambassador.
"

"His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march
past," continued the general, "and it seems the ambassador took no
notice and allowed himself to reply that: 'We in France pay no attention
to such trifles!' The Emperor did not condescend to reply.
 "We ought
not to fight either for or against Austria.


"Good-by, my dear fellow.
.






CHAPTER IV


Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men's talk and
faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered
whether the guests had all observed her father's hostile attitude toward
her.


"May I stay a little longer?" he said, letting his stout body sink into
an armchair beside her.
 He looked straight before
him and smiled quietly.
 Why do you ask me that?" said
Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning's conversation with her
father.
 At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege
to--you or Mademoiselle Julie Karagina.


Princess Mary shook her head.
 The thing is
impossible.
 I
wish they would come sooner.
.


"I don't know how to answer your question," he said, blushing without
knowing why.
 That is all one can say about her.


"I think not," he said, "and yet--yes.
.
"

Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.


"Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.
 When they
had last met on the old prince's name day, she had answered at random
all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what
he was saying.


She was twenty-seven.
 After the death of her brothers she had become
very wealthy.

A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day
to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of
compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.
 Julie never missed a ball, a
promenade, or a play.
 Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
 Every visitor who came to the house paid
his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused
himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts
rimes, which were in vogue at the Karagins'.


Julie said this was charming

"There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy," she said
to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book.
 But in Julie's presence, looking
at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and
her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy
to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the
decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded himself as
the possessor of those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned
the use of the income from them.


"My dear," said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, "I know from a reliable
source that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him married
to Julie.
 What do
you think of it, my dear?"

The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all the
revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned
and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and especially
into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Boris.
 Julie met him in a gay,
careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday's ball,
and asked when he was leaving.
 Though Boris had come intentionally to
speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender, he began speaking
irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from
sadness to joy, and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be
paying court to them.
 Julie was offended and replied that it was true
that a woman needs variety, and the same thing over and over again would
weary anyone.
.
" Boris began, wishing to sting her; but at
that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to
leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly wasted
his efforts--which was a thing he never allowed to happen.
 From early in the morning, wearing a dressing
jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:
on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
affairs of which she never spoke to anyone.


She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the pulley of
the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostovs and their
servants.
 Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her nose
and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern,
grim face at the new arrivals.
 "Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!" she shouted
to the count who was going to kiss her hand.
.


When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and
tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna kissed them
all in due order.


"I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me.
 She's here with her son.
 He
ran away from her and she came galloping after him.

Don't judge by me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young
Princess Irina Vasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight--looked
as if she had put two barrels on her arms.


"Well, now we'll talk.
 The old
fellow's crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift
without him, but it's not nice to enter a family against a father's
will.
 Then all will
be well.


When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants.
 very
sorry the prince is still ailing," and after a few more commonplace
remarks he rose.
 "If you'll allow me to leave my Natasha in your
hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I'll drive round to see Anna
Semenovna, it's quite near in the Dogs' Square, and then I'll come back
for her.
 He did not mention
this to his daughter, but Natasha noticed her father's nervousness
and anxiety and felt mortified by it.
 Princess Mary
looked frightened.
 "Madam, Countess.
 I did not know,
madam.
 God is my witness, I didn't know-" he repeated,
stressing the word "God" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at Natasha.

Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.


"I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not know,"
muttered the old man, and after looking Natasha over from head to foot
he went out.
"

Natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
.
.


"I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now," she said
with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears choking
her.
 She sat
in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing.
 as if I.


Natasha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed her
wet face against her.


"I can't tell you, I don't know.
 No one's to blame," said Natasha--"It's
my fault.
 No, I had better not think of him; not think
of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.
 Having fallen into the line of
carriages, the Rostovs' carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels
squeaking over the snow.
" whispered Sonya.
 Natasha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sonya and sat down,
scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite.


Natasha's looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country, and
that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty.
 "Look, there's Alenina," said Sonya, "with her
mother, isn't it?"

"Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!" remarked the
count.


"Look at our Anna Mikhaylovna--what a headdress she has on!"

"The Karagins, Julie--and Boris with them.
 One can see at once that
they're engaged.


Natasha looked in the direction in which her father's eyes were turned
and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face
and a string of pearls round her thick red neck--which Natasha knew was
covered with powder.
 "And he
no doubt is calming her jealousy of me.


"What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh, better
not think of it--not till he comes back!" she told herself, and began
looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the stalls.
 They swear by him, they offer
him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet.


"Have you been here long, Countess?" he inquired.


"Wonderful!" answered Natasha.






CHAPTER IX


The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was
some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth
stretched over boards.
 In the center of the stage sat some girls in red
bodices and white skirts.
 They all sang something.


First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they
both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand
of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
her.
 They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping
and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage--who represented
lovers--began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.
 She knew what it was all meant to represent, but
it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them.
 She kept looking round in
turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the
seminude women in the boxes, especially at Helene in the next box,
who--apparently quite unclothed--sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not
taking her eyes off the stage.
 And feeling the bright light that flooded
the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little
by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
experienced for a long while.
 She did not realize who and where she
was, nor what was going on before her.
 He was now in an adjutant's
uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot.


"Mais charmante!" said he, evidently referring to Natasha, who did not
exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
lips.
 Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the
stalls.
 Anatole went up to
him and began speaking to him, looking at and indicating the Rostovs'
box.
 They began waving their arms.
 Then
some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
in white and was now in light blue.
 "The
whole town is singing their praises and I don't even know then!"

Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess.


The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls.
 In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen.
 In the
stalls everyone clapped and shouted "bravo!" Then one of the men went
into a corner of the stage.
 (He was Duport, who received sixty
thousand rubles a year for this art.
 She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.


"Isn't Duport delightful?" Helene asked her.


Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage.
 This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and
oppressed.
 She asked the question and
blushed.



Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention.


"How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?" she asked
herself, and she could not refrain from turning round.
 Anatole left the box, serene and gay.
 That was the only part of the fourth act that Natasha saw.
 He was looking at her with glittering eyes,
smiling tenderly.



Only after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to think over
what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she
was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she
gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.


"O God! I am lost!" she said to herself.
 "How could I let him?" She sat
for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize
what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand what
had happened or what she felt.
 "What is it? What was that
terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling
now?" she thought.
 Nobody
will know and I shall never see him again," she told herself.
 "So it is
plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and
Andrew can love me still.






CHAPTER XI


Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his
creditors demanded from his father.


His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant
to the commander in chief--a post his father had procured for him--and
would at last try to make a good match there.


As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had
turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that
he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
actresses--with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to
be on intimate relations.
 Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a
payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be
free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
 He did not mind what people thought of him.


Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence
similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of
forgiveness.

Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin's name, position, and connections
as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him
and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it.

Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very process
of dominating another's will was in itself a pleasure, a habit, and a
necessity to Dolokhov.
 At supper after
the opera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his
intention of making love to her.


"She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us," replied Dolokhov.
.
 "Take care!"

"Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?" said Anatole, with a good-humored
laugh.






CHAPTER XII


The day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see
them.
 He had
not arrived.


On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her
parish church--the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of
victims of the plague.
 "God is the same every where.


After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant
announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna rose with
a stern air.
 It
was Helene.
 "Charming! No,
this is really beyond anything, my dear count," said she to Count Rostov
who had followed her in.
 "How can you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No,
I won't let you off! Mademoiselle George will recite at my house
tonight and there'll be some people, and if you don't bring your lovely
girls--who are prettier than Mademoiselle George--I won't know you! My
husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you.

You positively must! Between eight and nine.
 She
did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising
Natasha's beauty.
 The idea of throwing her
brother and Natasha together amused her.
 If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason
to shut yourself up.
 On hearing of Countess
Bezukhova's visit and the invitation for that evening, Marya Dmitrievna
remarked:

"I don't care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don't advise you
to; however, if you've promised--go.
 As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the opera--gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them.


Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her
son.
 Behind her sat Anatole,
and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
expectancy.

He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him.
"

"Come, come, Natasha!" said the count, as he turned back for his
daughter.
 "How beautiful she is!" Natasha without saying anything
stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
eyes.
 It's our turn to begin.
 Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.
 Can I never.


"Natalie?" he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
painfully pressed.
 I have nothing to say," her eyes replied.

She loved Prince Andrew--she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him.
 It means that he is
kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him.


After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna sat down in
her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.
 I said what I had
to say!"

"Well, and he?" asked the count.
.
 But what's the use
of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out," said Marya
Dmitrievna.
"

"Oh, no!" exclaimed Natasha.
"

Count Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
reasonableness.
 Though I don't
like letting you go, it is the best way.


"She has written to you.
 How she torments herself, poor thing! She's
afraid you might think that she does not like you.


"Don't answer like that, my good girl!" she said.
 He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but
he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy.
" and to
escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting
patterns with her.
 "Only so could I be completely happy; but now I have to
choose, and I can't be happy without either of them.
 Only," she thought,
"to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are
both equally impossible.
 But am
I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew's love, in which I
have lived so long?"

"Please, Miss!" whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
air.
" the girl went on, as Natasha, without
thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only that
it was a letter from him--from the man she loved.
 There is no other way for me," the letter began.
 He would steal her away and
carry her off to the ends of the earth.


"Yes, yes! I love him!" thought Natasha, reading the letter for the
twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
it.






CHAPTER XV


On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha's room, and to
her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa.


"Natasha!" she said, just audibly.


Natasha awoke and saw Sonya.


"Yes," answered Sonya softly.
.
.
.


"But I can't believe it," insisted Sonya.
 "It seems to me I've loved him a hundred
years.


"I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it too,
but it's only now that I feel such love.
.
 If you tell, you are my enemy!"
declared Natasha.
 "You want me to be miserable, you want us to be
separated.
.
.
 "What has he said to
you? Why doesn't he come to the house?"

Natasha did not answer her questions.
.

"Why doesn't he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave
you complete freedom--if it is really so; but I don't believe it!
Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?"

Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment.
 "Why, you have read his letter and you have seen
him.
 I will write to him,
and I will tell Papa!" said Sonya resolutely.
 When they got home Natasha was the first to
begin the explanation Sonya expected.
 "We have had an explanation today.
 He asked me what I had
promised Bolkonski.


"Perhaps I have.
 Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski.
 But what am I to do?"

Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her.
 Sonya knocked at her door.
 "She is capable of
anything.

"Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?"
thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natasha
had some terrible intention.
 "The count is away.
 Yes! If I don't sleep for three nights I'll not leave
this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
family be disgraced," thought she.
 At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would hasten abroad with post
horses.
 Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from
the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room
behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
things.


Dolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
ironic smile:

"Do you know? You'd really better drop it all.


"You wait a bit," he called after him.


"Now listen to me.
 I'm telling you this for the last time.
.

"Didn't I explain to you? What?" And Anatole, with the partiality
dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their
own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov
a hundred times.
.
.
.
 "It's time!"

Anatole went into the back room.
 Have a drink!" Dolokhov shouted to him from the
other room.
 More than once when Anatole's
regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again
the next night.
 More than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by "my
gentlemen" as he called them.
 More than once they had beaten him, and more than once they
had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew
more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
ordinary man to Siberia.


"Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir," or "your excellency," he would
say.
 "I am quite out of horses.
 Let me have what you can to go to the
fair.


On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front
corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding out a small, black
hand.


"How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!"

"Good day, your excellency!" he said, again holding out his hand to
Anatole who had just come in.


The driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine.
.
 "We'll start at once.
 It wasn't a case of urging them on, there was no holding
them in till we reached the place.
 The devils took us there in three
hours! Only the near one died of it.


"All take glasses; you too, Balaga.
 Well, comrades and friends of my
youth, we've had our fling and lived and reveled.


Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.


"And where's the fur cloak?" asked Dolokhov.
 "Why, she'll rush
out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay
at all there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mamma,' and she's frozen in
a minute and must go back--but you wrap the fur cloak round her first
thing and carry her to the sleigh.
"

The valet brought a woman's fox-lined cloak.


Dolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matrena, and
wrapped her up in it.
 There, good-by! Good-by, Matrena, wish
me luck!"

"Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!" said Matrena in her gypsy
accent.
 On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage;
something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
Arbat Street.
 The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.


"Come into the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out directly,"
said she.


"Come to the mistress, please," said the footman in his deep bass,
intercepting any retreat.


"To what Mistress? Who are you?" asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.


"You shameless good-for-nothing!" said she.
 "Marya Dmitrievna, for God's
sake let me in to her!" she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna unlocked
the door and went in without giving her an answer.
.
 You know that yourself.
 if he
challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?"

"Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked
you to?" shouted Natasha, raising herself on the sofa and looking
malignantly at Marya Dmitrievna.

"Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?
Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?.
.


"Well, let her sleep," said Marya Dmitrievna as she went out of the room
supposing Natasha to be asleep.


When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
of a man's footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
expression.
 She did not even get up to greet him.
"

In reply to the count's anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him
that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry.
 From
the pretense of illness, from his daughter's distress, and by the
embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna, the count saw clearly
that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible
for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he
avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
delayed their return to the country.






CHAPTER XIX


From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go
away somewhere, so as not to be near her.

Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
 In
a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the
dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makarin dashed
past.
 His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,
tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
with powdery snow.
 "He sees nothing
beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is
always cheerful, satisfied, and serene.
 "For fifty-eight years have I lived
in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!"

And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,
Marya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused Prince Andrew
without her parents' knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole
Kuragin into whose society Pierre's wife had thrown her and with whom
Natasha had tried to elope during her father's absence, in order to be
married secretly.


He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha, whom
he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,
folly, and cruelty.
 "He
could not marry--he is married!"

"Things get worse from hour to hour!" ejaculated Marya Dmitrievna.
 She must be told! Then at least she won't go on
expecting him.
 Behave as if you know nothing either,"
she said.
 I will be frank with you.
 Have you heard she has broken
off her engagement without consulting anybody? It's true this engagement
never was much to my liking.
.


Sonya entered the room with an agitated face.
 Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
Natasha's room.


"He knows all about it," said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre and
addressing Natasha.
.
 "On your honor?.
.


"Yes, I have just seen him.

He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the thought of
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
breathing.
 He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies', nor at
Komoneno's.
 Pierre drove to the Club.
 In the Club all was going on as
usual.
 Pierre felt it strange to see this
calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
soul.
 In the evening he drove to his sister's
to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting.
 "You don't know
what a plight our Anatole.
"

She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband's head, in his
glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that
rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
duel with Dolokhov.

"Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you," he added in French.
.


Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
anxiety.
 He seized Anatole
by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
to side till Anatole's face showed a sufficient degree of terror.
.
" repeated Pierre.
 What?" said Anatole, fingering a button of
his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.


"You're a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don't know what deprives
me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!" said Pierre,
expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.
.


"Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?" he said, moving toward
Anatole.
 "First, the letters," said he, as if
repeating a lesson to himself.
.


Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
.
"

Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
wanted.
 What? If you want me to do as
you wish, eh?"

"I take them back, I take them back!" said Pierre, "and I ask you to
forgive me.
" Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button.
.
"

Anatole smiled.
 Natasha was very ill, having, as Marya
Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had
been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily
procured.
 After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
woke Sonya and told her what she had done.
 The necessary antidotes had
been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so
weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and
so the countess had been sent for.
 He resolutely denied these
rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused.


As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his
father Natasha's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement
(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given
it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of Natasha's
elopement, with additions.
.
 The conversation was about Speranski--the news of whose
sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.


"Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him
a month ago," Prince Andrew was saying, "and by those who were unable to
understand his aims.
"

He paused at the sight of Pierre.
 He did it all silently and very quickly.
 His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.
.
 Is that true?"

"Both true and untrue," Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.


He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.
.
"

"She is very ill," said Pierre.


"So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his hand?"
said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.


Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.
?" said Pierre.
 Looking at them
Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
Rostovs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.
"

Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with
a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find
her.
) "He told me once
to apply to you.


"Yes.


"No, I know all is over," she said hurriedly.
.
"

She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love
welled up in Pierre.
 "I shall be happy
if it's in my power.
.
 I am not worth it!" exclaimed Natasha and
turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.
 But when he said it he was
amazed at his own words.
 "Where can I go now? Surely not to the
Club or to pay calls?" All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison
with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her
tears.
 Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky.

It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England's
intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St.
 To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to
serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon's refusal to
withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of
Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,
and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have
been so many less men in Napoleon's army and the war could not have
occurred.


Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal
aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action
performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.
 The higher a man
stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with
and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the
predestination and inevitability of his every action.
 Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the
emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds
of his own--that is, which he had taken from other kings--to the Empress
of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced
the Empress Marie Louise--who regarded him as her husband, though he had
left another wife in Paris--left her grieved by the parting which
she seemed hardly able to bear.


The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried
him in the same direction.


Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the
wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow
(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia
into which Alexander the Great had marched--Napoleon unexpectedly, and
contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an
advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.
 The troops, knowing of the Emperor's presence, were on the
lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: "Vive l'Empereur!" and
one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three
bridges to the other side.
.
 I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.
.
 He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army.
 He rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in
the direction of Kovno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the
Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for
him through the troops.
 It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
horses.
 Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others
tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses'
manes.


That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper
money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
containing information about the orders to the French army had been
found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who
had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the Legion
d'honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.






CHAPTER III


The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vilna for more than a
month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers.
 The vacillation
between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month.
 All the efforts of those who surrounded
the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time
pleasantly and forget that war was impending.


In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the
courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish
aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
the Emperor by his aides-de-camp.
 The aides-de-camp collected money by
subscription.
 Connoisseurs of such matters declared
that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.
 The
Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
 Boris noticed
Arakcheev's excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashev.


All the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was
worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought and how he
could find it out before others.
 They were
moving toward the door.
 The reasons on
which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
aggression.
,

(signed) Alexander.


Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts at the
village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn.


A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt.
 He led him past his soldiers
and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor's
quarters were, he believed, not far off.


They rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French hussar
horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the
village.
 This man
rode toward Balashev at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and
gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.


Balashev was only two horses' length from the equestrian with the
bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping
toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the
French colonel, whispered respectfully: "The King of Naples!" It was,
in fact, Murat, now called "King of Naples.


On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair
curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked
inquiringly at the French colonel.
.
.
" but Murat interrupted him.
 I wish success to your mission,"
and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his
glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
awaiting him.


Balashev rode on, supposing from Murat's words that he would very soon
be brought before Napoleon himself.


"Where is your dispatch?" he inquired.


Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter and laid it
on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid
across two barrels).


"You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,"
protested Balashev, "but permit me to observe that I have the honor to
be adjutant general to His Majesty.


"You will be treated as is fitting," said he and, putting the packet in
his pocket, left the shed.


Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev to come to
him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the
baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one
except Monsieur de Castres.


Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came
to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's wish to honor him
with an audience.


Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had stood in
front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now two French
grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a
brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
horse and his Mameluke, Rustan.

Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going
for his ride.


After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashev to follow
him.


Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a
study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him
on his mission.
 He had just finished
dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over
a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white
leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and
Hessian boots.
 It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that
day.
 Judging by the calmly
moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev
was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
negotiations.
 He said that the
Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his passports a
sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his own initiative
and without his sovereign's assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not
desire war, and had no relations with England.
 He grew confused and said: "On condition that the
French army retires beyond the Niemen.


"The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire," replied Balashev.


The latter bowed his head respectfully.


Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,
only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.
 Napoleon turned
quickly and began to pace the room.
"

He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
stopped in front of Balashev.
 Balashev noticed that his left leg was
quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
expression.
 "If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept
such conditions.
 You offer me negotiations! But what is the
aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?" he continued
hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and
power and Alexander's errors and duplicity.


The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate.


"I hear you have made peace with Turkey?"

Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.


"Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining
Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those
provinces as I gave him Finland.
 Catherine the Great could
not have done more," said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he
paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev almost the very words
he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit.

Granted that were they competent they might be made use of," continued
Napoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his
perception the two were one and the same)--"but they are not even that!
They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the
most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first
movements.
 "I know everything.
 As for the Swedes--it is their fate to be governed
by mad kings.
"

Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.
 Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
in the right.
 There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
lions.
"

And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood silently before him in
the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned
round, drew close to Balashev's face, and, gesticulating rapidly and
energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:

"Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I'll wipe it off the map
of Europe!" he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he
struck one of his small hands energetically with the other.
 He
paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's eyes, and said in a
quiet voice:

"And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!"

Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light.
 Napoleon,
without giving them a glance, turned to Balashev:

"Assure the Emperor Alexander from me," said he, taking his hat, "that
I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly
esteem his lofty qualities.
 Everyone in the reception room
rushed forward and descended the staircase.
 But,
to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine
with the Emperor that day.
 It was evident that
he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
did it.


And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,
he remarked:

"Why such a quantity of churches?"

"The Russians are very devout," replied Balashev.


"But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that," said Napoleon.
 "If there is a point
we don't see it, or it is not at all witty," their expressions seemed
to say.
 Balashev, who was on the alert
all through the dinner, replied that just as "all roads lead to Rome,"
so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and "among them the
road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose.
" Balashev involuntarily
flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had
he uttered the word Poltava before Caulaincourt began speaking of the
badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg
reminiscences.
 Napoleon turned to him with a
pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.


"And let him know that I will do so!" said Napoleon, rising and pushing
his cup away with his hand.
 I'll drive them out.
.
.
 In a new country, amid new conditions,
Prince Andrew found life easier to bear.
 He was now concerned only with the nearest practical
matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more
eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him.
 Not having found
Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might
be before he met Kuragin, despite his contempt for him and despite all
the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
to a conflict with him--he knew that when he did meet him he would not
be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
snatching at food.
 Kutuzov, who was already weary of
Bolkonski's activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.


Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at
Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,
being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad.
 The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the
same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,
the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only
somewhat older.
 Mademoiselle Bourienne was
the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
existence and full of joyous hopes for the future.
 Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he
was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
and retired to his apartments directly after dinner.
 In the evening,
when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to
tell him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the old prince
began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her
superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,
was the only person really attached to him.
 If
there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can't
blame her for it at all.


"What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've already been talking it over!
Eh?"

"Father, I did not want to judge," said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
bitter tone, "but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame--the one to blame--is
that Frenchwoman.
 passed judgement!" said the old man in a
low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,
but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: "Be off, be off! Let not a
trace of you remain here!.
.
"


Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him
to stay another day.
 Next day,
before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms.


"Well, go on!" said his son.


Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out
of the room.


"Thank God that I can," replied Prince Andrew.
 "I
understand you" (she looked down).
" She looked a little above Prince
Andrew's head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks
at the place where a familiar portrait hangs.
 My boy is growing up
and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
deceived.
 And I am off to the army.
 The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified
camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a
junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
large French forces.
 He received
Bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,
but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff.
 First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the
army under Bagration, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormasov.
 It was this: the Emperor did not
assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;
the men around him were his assistants.

Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech.


Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
ideas every day--especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness
characteristic of people employed in a country not their own--there were
many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
were there.
 Pfuel and his adherents demanded
a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,
ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory.


The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as
always happens, was met by representatives of the other.
 The members of
this party were those who had demanded an advance from Vilna into Poland
and freedom from all prearranged plans.
 The men of that party,
remembering Suvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,
or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of
Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.


Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
Tsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where
he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry
uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but
unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
the general confusion.
 The only
reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,
before we are turned out of Petersburg.
"

This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, who, for other
reasons of state, was in favor of peace.


The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de
Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
chief.
 These men, though enchanted with the sovereign
for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive
modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief's
staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be
raised to the highest pitch.
 A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the
Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
or less forcible and correct.


All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and
promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole
drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it
was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere.
 Whatever question arose, a swarm of these
drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew
over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
those who were disputing honestly.






CHAPTER X


This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one
day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him
personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to
present himself at Bennigsen's quarters at six that evening.


Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quarters--a country gentleman's
house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river.
 Neither
Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the Emperor's
aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that the Emperor,
accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second
time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the
suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.
 In that drawing room were gathered, by
the Emperor's wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred
indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
view of the impending difficulties.


Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,
broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades.
 or "the whole affair will be ruined," or
"something absurd will come of it.
".
 Pfuel barely glanced--not so much at
Prince Andrew as past him--and said, with a laugh: "That must have been
a fine tactical war"; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the
room from which the sound of voices was heard.
 Pfuel was one of those hopelessly
and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of
martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident
on the basis of an abstract notion--science, that is, the supposed
knowledge of absolute truth.






CHAPTER XI


Prince Andrew's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when
Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkonski, but not
pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he
went.
.
"
continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself,
"the man who advised the Drissa camp--I see no alternative but the
lunatic asylum or the gallows!"

Without heeding the end of the Italian's remarks, and as though
not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed him
graciously.
 He came out of the study into the
drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put
questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
present.


The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that
presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position
away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads.
 Some disputed his arguments, others
defended them.
 "Why, you yourselves know
everything better than I do.

Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,
and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who
was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all
that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there
were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
had not been precisely executed.
 Of all those present,
evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no
hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a
theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out.


The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted
the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and
personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
conclusion from all that had been said.
 A thought that had
long since and often occurred to him during his military activities--the
idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that
therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius--now appeared
to him an obvious truth.
 The best
generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
men.






CHAPTER XII


Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostov had received a letter from
his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha's illness and the
breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by
Natasha's having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from
the army and return home.


"Adored friend of my soul!" he wrote.
 But this shall be our last separation.
"

It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sonya.
 "A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a
dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by
election.
 If the thought that things looked bad chanced
to enter anyone's head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of
the task nearest to hand.
 First they camped gaily before Vilna, making
acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being
reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders.
 Then came an order
to retreat to Sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry
away with them.
 Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and
of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing
military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides
that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
all as we can imagine or relate it.
 And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's
tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches
extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was
his habit, and crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty.
 "In the first place, there must have been such a confusion
and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did lead
his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
men nearest to him," thought he, "the rest could not have seen how or
with whom Raevski came onto the dam.


"I can't stand this any more," said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov did not
relish Zdrzhinski's conversation.
 and the
water is running on my seat! I'll go and look for shelter.
"

Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.


Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came running back
to the shanty.


"Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! About two hundred yards away
there's a tavern where ours have already gathered.


"Rostov, where are you?"

"Here.
 What lightning!" they called to one another.
 They were
going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it
completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no
account yield their position.
 Mary Hendrikhovna obliged them with the
loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen
Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had brought their kits,
changed their wet things for dry ones.
 A board was found,
fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was
produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary
Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her.


"But you take it without sugar?" she said, smiling all the time, as if
everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
had a double meaning.


"It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir
my tea.


"Too hot!" she replied, blushing with pleasure.
 They drew
lots to settle who should make up her set.
.
 "What an idea,
doctor!"

"I'll stand guard on it myself!" said Ilyin.


"No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two
nights," replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,
waiting for the game to end.
 Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly
getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar.
 But
Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea.


Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
before the wind.
 That curly grass
which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still
wet with the night's rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also
wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
side.
 During the
first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached
himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time
it had come of itself.


Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of
that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping from
Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.

Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through
the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning
sunbeams.
 Again all was silent and then
again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
them.
 Nearer and
nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
pursuing them.


Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt.
.
 Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it.
 One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot
flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
horse fell in among the hussars.
 That Frenchman, by his
uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse
and urging it on with his saber.
 In another moment Rostov's horse dashed
its breast against the hindquarters of the officer's horse, almost
knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing why,
raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.


The instant he had done this, all Rostov's animation vanished.

Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
had vanquished.
 His eyes, screwed
up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at
Rostov with shrinking terror.
 In front, the
French infantry were firing as they ran.
 And I remember how my arm
paused when I raised it.
"

Rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin.


Rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to
his amazement had gained him the St.
 "So others are even more afraid than I am!" he thought.
 She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
in how far she was to blame for what had happened.
 And it was even pleasant to be able to
show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical
treatment and did not value her life.
 But when he had
gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he
assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but.
 The doctors said that
she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the
stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs did not move to the
country that summer of 1812.






CHAPTER XVII


Natasha was calmer but no happier.

Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,
in face of her sorrow.
 The previous autumn, the hunting, "Uncle," and the Christmas
holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest
and most painfully.
 Yet it was necessary to live
on.
 But
this was not enough.
 Natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
anyone, but wanted nothing for herself.
 It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because
Natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
which she had experienced with Kuragin that it never entered her head
that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,
romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
several instances.
 She
crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror
at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,
everything, to have mercy upon her.
 The prayers to which she surrendered
herself most of all were those of repentance.
 She has freshened
up very much.
 It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was
in danger, it was said that Smolensk had surrendered, that Napoleon had
an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.
 It was a hot July day.
 As Natasha, at her mother's side, passed through the crowd
behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a
young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.
 But
she was always imagining that.
 It always seemed to her that everyone
who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her.
 I used to be bad, but now I
know I am good," she thought, "but yet my best years are slipping by
and are no good to anyone.
 From habit she scrutinized the ladies'
dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought
with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,
and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own
vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
her.
 Tears, the cause of which she herself did not
understand, made Natasha's breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive
feeling agitated her.


"Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good
forever, forever!" she pleaded.


The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,
holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and
solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer.
"

"As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united
by brotherly love--let us pray!" thought Natasha.


When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
Denisov.
 When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
all the wrongs she had done him.
 She included among her
enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her
father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm--and though he did not
hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy.
 When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,
she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself
that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at
any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.
 "I want nothing, wish for
nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take
me!" prayed Natasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing
herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,
from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.


The countess looked round several times at her daughter's softened face
and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.


Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order
Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he
knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors
of the sanctuary screen.
 But neither could she doubt the
righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees.






CHAPTER XIX


From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with Natasha's
grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to
be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
horizon--from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented
itself.
 swindled the country and the Tsar, and the
country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She
smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and
no one will ever know it.


Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle
and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostovs'
there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and
acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along
irresistibly.
 This prophecy
pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
answer to the question that engrossed him.
 Once when making such calculations he
wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the
sum of the numbers did not come right.
 This was only five too much, and five was
represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the
word Empereur.
 This discovery excited him.
 His love for Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the
comet, 666, L'Empereur Napoleon, and L'russe Besuhof--all this had to
mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere
of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
great achievement and great happiness.


His conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter's tone of anxious
hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in
Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised
to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the
Emperor's being expected to arrive next day--all aroused with fresh
force that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had
been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially
since the beginning of the war.
 "You know Nicholas
has received a St.
 "I
saw in that same army order that he, Bolkonski" (she whispered the name
hastily), "is in Russia, and in the army again.
" Pierre replied, "that he has nothing to forgive.
.
.
.
 you.
 I know no one kinder, more
generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been
there then, and now too, I don't know what would have become of me,
because.


Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
resembled Natasha.


Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.


"Oh yes, your plan.


"No, after dinner," said the old count, evidently expecting much
enjoyment from that reading.
"

"People are being arrested.
"

"And have you heard?" Shinshin asked.
 I don't
know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no
one can answer for himself.


Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round.
"

Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
count's patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her
father.


"What a darling our Papa is!" she cried, kissing him, and she again
looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
with her better spirits.
.
"

At this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up
to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
that was now deep and now shrill:

"Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it's as you please,
but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I
can't.
.
.
"

The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and
turned angrily to her husband.
"

"It's not nonsense, Papa.
"

"That'll do, that'll do--nonsense.
.
.


"Well, then, au revoir!" said the count, and went out of the room.


"Because it is better for me to come less often.
"

"Why? No, tell me!" Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.


They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces.






CHAPTER XXI


After the definite refusal he had received, Petya went to his room
and there locked himself in and wept bitterly.
 That
morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
collar to look like a grown-up man.
 While
dressing, Petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the
gentleman-in-waiting.
 As he approached
the Kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
out his elbows in a menacing way.


Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man's.
 One of the generals who
drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs', and Petya thought of
asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
manly thing to do.
 There were people not only in the square,
but everywhere--on the slopes and on the roofs.


"Father! Angel! Dear one!" she kept repeating, wiping away her tears
with her fingers.


Quite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting "hurrah!" as
if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but
on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
forward and everybody shouted "hurrah!"

"So this is what the Emperor is!" thought Petya.
 When he came to himself, a
man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his
head and wearing a shabby blue cassock--probably a church clerk and
chanter--was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
the pressure of the crowd with the other.


"You've crushed the young gentleman!" said the clerk.


"One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing
people! Poor dear, he's as white as a sheet!"--various voices were heard
saying.


Petya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had
passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who
would be returning that way.
 The clerk
who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
were officiating that day with the bishop.
 All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,
were such as might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age, but
they did not interest him now.
 He sat on his elevation--the pedestal of
the cannon--still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and
by his love for him.
 The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced
when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further
intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.


Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,
to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed
impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing.
 The firing was still proceeding when
officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the
cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were
again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
again.
 At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
cathedral doors.


While the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window, said:

"The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.
 The people, with Petya among them, rushed
toward the balcony.


"Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!.
.


"There! I said if only we waited--and so it was!" was being joyfully
said by various people.
 The old men,
dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,
were especially striking.
 For the most part they sat quietly in their
places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached
themselves to someone younger.
 The words that had struck him in the Emperor's appeal--that
the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his
people--strengthened this idea.
 Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre
heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor's
honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
provinces.
.
 Scarcely had he
opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his
head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first
speaker, interrupted him.
 Evidently accustomed to managing debates and
to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:

"I imagine, sir," said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, "that we
have been summoned here not to discuss whether it's best for the empire
at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.
 But to judge what is best--conscription or
the militia--we can leave to the supreme authority.
.
.
.
"


Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator's sarcastic
smile and the freedom of Pierre's remarks.
.
"

Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies' and knew as a bad
cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,
interrupted Adraksin.
 "We will all arise, every
one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!" he shouted, rolling his
bloodshot eyes.


Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several
persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
phrase, said:

"That's right, quite right! Just so!"

Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his
serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in
order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak.
 Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in
the same tone.


The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald
seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom
Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing
boston at the clubs.
 He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to
blame and wished to justify himself.


"I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
when we know what is needed!" said he, trying to be heard above the
other voices.


"Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!" shouted
one man.


"He is the enemy of mankind!" cried another.
.
.


"Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment," said Rostopchin.

"I am straight from the palace.
 Their
chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to
stretch their legs and converse in couples.


"Gentlemen!" said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
.
.
"

The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and
rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.


"Yes, most precious.
.
 He
stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood
everything in his own way.


From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.

As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling
voice.
 The other was
the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard.


Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and
at once consented to Petya's request and went himself to enter his name.


Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
insulted.
 The Emperor
reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired.
 The armies
were divided at the commencement of the campaign.


The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,
aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy
to influence Alexander, and Pfuel's whole plan was abandoned and the
command entrusted to Barclay.
 Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm of adjutants general
remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation
and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under
the observation of all these "eyes of the Emperor," became still more
cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.


Barclay stood for caution.
 The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and
demanded a general engagement.


Bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.
 I cannot stand it here.
 I thought
I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out
that I am serving Barclay.
 This general,
hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,
and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,
as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not
seen.


"Well? Are you satisfied now?" said he.
 He was
ill and did not leave his study.
 Tikhon alone attended him.


Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars.
 She did not realize the significance of this war, though
Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,
and though the "God's folk" who came to see her reported, in their own
way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,
and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskaya), who had resumed
correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.
 We in
Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.


"My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the
news which I have inspires me yet more.


On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew.
 In his
first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
to say and begged to be restored to his favor.
 Prince Andrew's second letter, written near
Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of
the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
as to the further progress of the war.


"Go and get it for me," said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
"

Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.


"No, don't!" he exclaimed with a frown.
 The old prince returned
with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivanovich, bringing the letter
and a plan.
 He was examining the
plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.
.
"

"Ha ha ha! The theater of war!" said the prince.
.
.
.
"

"Ah, the letter? Yes.
" replied the prince peevishly.
.
 yes.
.
.
 it must be exactly like the sample.
"

He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.


The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the prince
did not let him go.
"

Alpatych went out.
 He wished
to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
thoughts came to him in bed.
 So he called Tikhon and went through the
rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.


He went about looking at every corner.
 Every place seemed
unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.

That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
thoughts he had had when lying there.
 He was not meditating, but only deferring the
moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
bed.
 "Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would
release me!" thought he.

No, it was something, something in the drawing room.
"

"Tikhon, what did we talk about at dinner?"

"About Prince Michael.
 "Yes, I
know, Prince Andrew's letter! Princess Mary read it.
 Dessalles said
something about Vitebsk.
 Now I'll read it.
 "No, no, I don't
want anything!" he shouted.


He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes.
 And there
rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian
camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,
vigorous and alert, entering Potemkin's gaily colored tent, and a
burning sense of jealousy of "the favorite" agitated him now as strongly
as it had done then.
 He recalled all the words spoken at that
first meeting with Potemkin.


The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpatych,
Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the
prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,
though from Prince Andrew's letter it was evident that to remain at Bald
Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter
by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at Smolensk, asking him to let
her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which
Bald Hills was exposed.
 come back, Yakov Alpatych! For Christ's sake
think of us!" cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the
enemy.
 As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing,
but these did not impress him.
 What struck him most was the sight of a
splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which
was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder.
 This fact
impressed Alpatych, but in thinking about his own business he soon
forgot it.


All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.

Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, by Alpatych's advice, had bought a
wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an
inn, and a corn dealer's shop in that province.


Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was standing
before his shop which opened onto the street.
"

"Women's fuss, women's fuss!" said Alpatych.


"Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych.


All night long troops were moving past the inn.
 It was a
sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already hot.


From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning.
 At eight
o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry.
.
 "He has ordered
me to inquire into the position of affairs," he added.
 "They've brought
things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!.


"To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski," he
announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
to him and took the letters.
.
 I am just starting myself.
 Inform them.
 I from
the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are marching to unite
our forces before Smolensk, which junction will be effected on the
22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our
compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last
warrior in our valiant ranks has perished.


"He's done her to death.
.
.
 "What has been decided?"

Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.

The orders were not to let them in.
"

Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come
in, and settled up with the innkeeper.
 Half the street was in shadow, the
other half brightly lit by the sun.
 The people did not at once realize the meaning of
this bombardment.
 With lively curiosity
everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
their heads.


"What force!" remarked one.
 "Knocked the roof and ceiling all to
splinters!"

"Routed up the earth like a pig," said another.


"That's grand, it bucks one up!" laughed the first.
 The innkeeper stood at the gate.


"What are you staring at?" he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,
with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the
corner to listen to what was being said.


"Scoundrel, what are you doing?" shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the
cook.
 On two sides
black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires.
 Get away,
get away!" and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:

"I'll teach you to run into the yards!"

Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to
set off.


Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on
filling their bags.
 This fire was already burning itself
out.
 The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now
suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness
the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads.
 Seeing that his trap
would not be able to move on for some time, Alpatych got down and turned
into the side street to look at the fire.
 Soldiers were continually
rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a
man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
street, while others carried bundles of hay.


"Alpatych!" a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.


"Mercy on us! Your excellency!" answered Alpatych, immediately
recognizing the voice of his young prince.


"Your.
"

"Why are you here?" Prince Andrew repeated.


Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
began writing in pencil on a page he tore out.
"

Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
Alpatych.
.
 You must
please excuse me," he went on apologetically.


"Ou-rou-rou!" yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
around.
.
 Heat and
drought had continued for more than three weeks.

Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth.
 The unreaped corn was
scorched and shed its grain.
 The marshes dried up.
 The artillery and baggage
wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,
choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night.
 Some of this dust
was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a
cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and
worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
road.


Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that
regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving
and giving orders, engrossed him.
 Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.


In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the sixth
of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)
and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to
pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.
 He was sitting on
the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of
bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.
 A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran
into the house.
 On
hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on
his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word
began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew's knee.


Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report
on the position of affairs.


"Yes, let them have it," replied Prince Andrew.


"If you noticed some disorder in the garden," said Alpatych, "it was
impossible to prevent it.
 Gently
disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
avenue at a gallop.
 On seeing the young master,
the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some
green plums they had dropped.
 The sun,
a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably
through his black coat.
 The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a
foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies
of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing
about in it.
"

"What prince? Ours?" said many voices, and the men were in such haste
to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them.


"Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!" he thought, and he looked at his own
naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust
and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that
immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.
 I swear
to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smolensk.
.
 God forbid that you
should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You
would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed
to wear the uniform.
.
.


One man ought to be in command, and not two.
.
.
 So I write you frankly: call out the
militia.
 This is
painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit.
 Only I am
sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.
 Tell me, for God's sake, what will Russia, our mother
Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our
good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom
are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,
a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities.
 That life of
the salons is unchanging.
 Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had
again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
them again, but the salons of Anna Pavlovna and Helene remained just as
they had been--the one seven and the other five years before.
 At Anna
Pavlovna's they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte's successes just
as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was
to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna
Pavlovna was the representative.


Of late, since the Emperor's return from the army, there had been some
excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations
of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.
 In the French
circle of Helene and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the
enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon's attempts at
conciliation were discussed.
 In Helene's circle the war in general was regarded as a series
of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
view prevailed expressed by Bilibin--who now in Petersburg was quite
at home in Helene's house, which every clever man was obliged to
visit--that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters
be settled.


Anna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.


This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July.


On the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna's again met the
"man of great merit.


Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said in a
whisper:

"I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the
Tsarevich should not be with the army.
 He
is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians
who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the
Russian commanders.

On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light bay
bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,
and aides-de-camp.
 Followed by
Lelorgne d'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop
and reined in his horse with an amused expression.


"One of Platov's Cossacks says that Platov's corps is joining up with
the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief.
 He wished to talk to him himself.

Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all
sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,
and are keen at guessing their master's baser impulses, especially those
prompted by vanity and pettiness.
.
 Napoleon, after
making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to
its native fields.
 Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in
his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
armed peasants and domestic serfs.
 She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
could not be sure what change there was in his face.


By the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little prince
had already left for Moscow.
 One thing was certain--that he was suffering
and wished to say something.


The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due
to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
restlessness confirmed her opinion.
 She knew
that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray.

She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of
her.
 The cares of preparation
and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.

She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in
the room next to the one where the prince lay.
 Several times, waking up,
she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps
of Tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over.


But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
him.
 Toward
morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.
 That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's illness.


"But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!" she
cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.
 His head is clearer.
.
.
 To see him, talk to
him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.
 He was
lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
motionless.
 He
twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.
 When
she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds.
 Then his lips
and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.


"Mmm.
.
ate.
.
.
" he brought out.


"If only I had known.
.
.
.
.
.
 thank you!.
.
.
" and tears began to flow from his
eyes.
 "Call Andrew!" he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression
of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
 So at least it
seemed to Princess Mary.
 Then as if in
answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
"

And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes.


Again he closed his eyes.
 I like it," was what he said.
 When she had left the room the
prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and
then he had a second and final stroke.


Princess Mary stayed on the veranda.
 She ran out sobbing into the garden and as
far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had
planted.
.


When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again
to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne--who had remained at
Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it--coming toward her with a
stranger.
 Then,
excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince's room.
 The
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.
 go away!"

She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
slope by the pond, where no one could see her.
.


"Princess, it's God's will! You must be prepared for everything," said
the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.


The doctor tried to stop her.
 She pushed him aside and ran to her
father's door.
 They all
drew back from the bed, making way for her.


"No, he's not dead--it's impossible!" she told herself and approached
him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips
to his cheek.
 But she stepped back immediately.
 Then they dressed him in uniform
with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.


Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
the coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all with
fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old
prince's cold and stiffened hand.


More important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning of the
very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the
princess' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been a village meeting at
which it had been decided not to move but to wait.
 On the evening of the day the
old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for
the funeral.
 The peasants feared him more than they did their
master.
 Just as Dron was a model
village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince's estates for
twenty years in vain.
 But he also
knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,
must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters' and the serfs'.


"Now just listen, Dronushka," said he.


Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again lowered
his eyes.
 And don't go to any meeting yourself, do you
hear?"

Dron suddenly fell on his knees.


"What is it you have got into your heads, eh?.
.
"

"'Told them,' I dare say!" said Alpatych.
 He had managed people for a long time
and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
that they can possibly disobey.


The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward.
 She
lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the
leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused
thoughts were centered on one subject--the irrevocability of death and
her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had
shown itself during her father's illness.


The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays
shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco
cushion at which Princess Mary was looking.
 She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed
her, and immediately began to cry.
 The princess looked up at her.
 She said her
only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,
and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude.
 The princess
heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
listening to the sound of her voice.
.
.

If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows.
.
.
 Alpatych
did say something about going.
.
 Speak to him; I can do nothing,
nothing, and don't want to.
 He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,
but I think it would now be better to stay here," said Mademoiselle
Bourienne.


"I think it would be best to appeal to that general," she continued,
"and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.
 le General Rameau would occupy
Prince Andrew's study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
his letters and papers.
 I should be given a small room as a favor, the
soldiers would violate my father's newly dug grave to steal his crosses
and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and
would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow.
.
.
 For herself she did not care where she remained or what
happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
father and of Prince Andrew.
 Dear friend, I
can do nothing.
 I understand nothing.
"

Dron paused.


"The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?" she asked.
 She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some
mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
give.
 She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her
without scruple to forget her own grief.
 We do not grudge them anything.
 Tell them so.
 She replied that she had never doubted his
devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
peasants.
.
"

"You're making some mistake.
 "I will offer them monthly rations and
housing at our Moscow estate.
 But again the sense that she
represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly
began her speech.
 "Dronushka tells me
that the war has ruined you.
 I am myself going away because it
is dangerous here.
.
.
 You shall be given food and lodging.
"

The princess stopped.


All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression.


"But why not?" asked the princess.


But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:

"Why should we agree? We don't want the grain.
 Don't agree.
.
.
 Go away yourself, alone.

"Why don't you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here
the enemy would ruin you.
 Let them ruin us! We won't take your grain.


"Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses
and go into bondage! I dare say! 'I'll give you grain, indeed!' she
says," voices in the crowd were heard saying.


With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the
house.






CHAPTER XII


For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her
room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached her from
the village, but it was not of them she was thinking.
 She felt that she
could not understand them however much she might think about them.
 The night was calm and fresh.


"Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died," she
thought.
 "He had always thought what he said then.
 She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going
to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
at the door.
 Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
said all he longed to say, and not Tikhon but I might have heard and
understood him.
 "Perhaps he
would then have said to me what he said the day he died.
 I remember how he began
speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive--he had forgotten she
was dead--and Tikhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,
'Fool!' He was greatly depressed.
" And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
to her on the day of his death.
 "Dear-est!" she repeated, and began
sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul.


"What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking
now?" This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she
saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay
in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief.
 With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,
expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the
silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.


"You're first!" cried Ilyin, flushed.
.
!" sang one of the peasants with a
blissful smile.


"The one in pink is mine, so keep off!" said Ilyin on seeing Dunyasha
running resolutely toward him.


"She'll be ours!" said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.


"What do you want, my pretty?" said Ilyin with a smile.
"

"Co-o-om-pa-ny!" roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl.
.
 Alpatych.
.
 Grand! Forgive us for Christ's
sake, eh?" said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.


"Or perhaps they amuse your honor?" remarked Alpatych with a staid air,
as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.


"I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don't
wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her
horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her
excellency cannot get away.


Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpatych
to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs.
 It appeared
that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and
her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect
that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
not appeared when Alpatych sent for him; and that in the morning when
the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had
come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that
they would unharness the horses.
 When she saw his Russian
face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion.
 "A helpless girl
overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!
And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there
are in her features and expression!" thought he as he looked at her and
listened to her timid story.
 She turned away, and then, as if
fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at
him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry.
 Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.
 "Go
when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.


Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
.
.
 I'll flay you all alive!.
 He said
the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
imprudent to "overresist" them without an armed force, and would it not
be better first to send for the military?

"I'll give them armed force.
.
" asked Karp.


"Caps off, traitors!" shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice.
 "Where's the
Elder?" he cried furiously.


"The Elder.
.


"We don't riot, we're following the orders," declared Karp, and at that
moment several voices began speaking together.


"It's as the old men have decided--there's too many of you giving
orders.
 "Bind him, bind him!" he
shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych.


"Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?" he called out.


With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.


And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own
belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.
 It's
all nonsense.
 Let it
all be done properly, according to rule.
 "I
am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.
 His kind,
honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.


When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange
question presented itself to her: did she love him?

On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess' position was not
a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage, more than
once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.
 It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,
had against his will more than once entered his head.
 For himself
personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her
he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his
father's affairs in order, and would even--he felt it--ensure Princess
Mary's happiness.
 A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince
Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and
whether he would soon be back.
 The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in
chief's orderly speaks to officers, replied:

"What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll be here soon.
 What do you
want?"

The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
approached Bolkonski with a slight bow.


"You're also waiting for the commander in chief?" said he.
.
 So you are Pwince
Andwew Bolkonski?" He swayed his head.
 "Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make
your acquaintance!" he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again
pressed Prince Andrew's hand.
 Sounds of
hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.


"And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,
General," he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and
Denisov.
 He sat heavily and swayed limply on
his brisk little horse.


"Whew.
 whew!" he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
yard.
.


"And how's your father?"

"I received news of his death, yesterday," replied Prince Andrew
abruptly.


Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
his cap and crossed himself:

"May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's will be done to us all!" He
sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while.
 He
sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.
 Kutuzov, his
hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly.

Kutuzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of
annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: "For our
country's welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!" Denisov blushed like a
girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,
time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the
enemy's lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma.


"Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?" said the general
on duty in a discontented voice, "the plans must be examined and several
papers have to be signed.
"

An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
within.
 I'll look
at them here," said he.
 At
those words Kutuzov looked round.
 It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and
learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised
them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge--he did
not try to display any of these--but because of something else.
 He
despised them because of his old age and experience of life.
 The only
instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred
to looting by the Russian troops.
 At the end of the report the general
put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment
from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when
landowners lodged petitions for compensation.


"Into the stove.
 into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my
dear fellow," said he, "into the fire with all such things! Let them cut
the crops and burn wood to their hearts' content.
 I don't order it
or allow it, but I don't exact compensation either.
 One can't get on
without it.






CHAPTER XVI


"Well, that's all!" said Kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents,
and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.


He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:

"Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!"

He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
dish for her.
 Let's have a talk," said Kutuzov.
 But you're right, you're right! It's not
here that men are needed.
 The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers
served there as you do.
.
 I remember,
yes, I remember you with the standard!" said Kutuzov, and a flush of
pleasure suffused Prince Andrew's face at this recollection.
 I know your path is the path of
honor!" He paused.
 "I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to
send.
 but everything
came at the right time.
.
" he went on, returning
to the subject of "advisers" which evidently occupied him.
 For that, not storming and attacking but patience and
time are wanted.
 Kamenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed
these two things and took more fortresses than Kamenski and made them
Turks eat horseflesh!" He swayed his head.
.
 * Some want a thing--others don't.
 What's one to
do?" he asked, evidently expecting an answer.
 "Well, what do you want
us to do?" he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.
 Dans le doute, mon
cher," he paused, "abstiens-toi" *(2)--he articulated the French proverb
deliberately.
 The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
that old man--in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,
and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)
only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events--the more
reassured he was that everything would be as it should.
 At the approach of danger there are always two voices that
speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a
man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;
the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and
painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man's power to
foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is
therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to
think about what is pleasant.
 In solitude a man generally listens to
the first voice, but in society to the second.
 It was
said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners
from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon
among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchin's witty
remark on that occasion.
 The foreigners were deported to Nizhni by boat,
and Rostopchin had said to them in French: "Rentrez en vousmemes; entrez
dans la barque, et n'en faites pas une barque de Charon.
" * There was
talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
Moscow, and to this Shinshin's witticism was added--that for that alone
Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon.


Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell
soiree.
 "'What pleasure is there to be' is not Russian!"

"You spare no one," continued Julie to the young man without heeding the
author's remark.
 "Quand on.
 "We were just talking of you,"
she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman.
"

"Oh, don't talk to me of my regiment," replied Pierre, kissing his
hostess' hand and taking a seat beside her.
 "I am so sick of it.


"I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way," said Julie.
 He
asks too much.

"Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.
"

"Why?" asked Julie.
 well, because everyone is
going: and besides--I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.
 And why do they stay on so long in
Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago.


"They are waiting for their younger son," Pierre replied.
 "He joined
Obolenski's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment is
being formed.
 The count wanted to leave long ago, but the
countess won't on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.
 She sang a song.


"You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de
Souza's novels.


"Come now, Count, you know!"

"I don't know anything about it," said Pierre.
"

"No, madame!" Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, "I have not
taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova's knight at all, and have
not been to their house for nearly a month.
 But I cannot understand the
cruelty.
"

"Well, and how is she?" asked Pierre.


"She is well, but sad.
 Nicholas Rostov! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill
her and had wounded some of her people.
"

"Another romance," said the militia officer.
" *


    * "A little bit in love with the young man.
.
"

The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.
.
 Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to
repress a smile.
 The
flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the
flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and
a green jacket, who was moaning piteously.
 Another criminal, thin and
pale, stood near.
.
 At dawn next day Pierre was approaching
Mozhaysk.
 It was full of officers.


Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the
march.
 Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the
farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea
of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
joyful feeling he had not experienced before.


If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must
have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,
he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally
clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow.
 If it is said that he expected to end the
campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary.
 The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,
and that the position at Borodino (the one where the battle was fought),
far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one
might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at
hazard.
 This was shown first by the fact that there were no
entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the
position of the Shevardino Redoubt.
 And the Russians, not having
time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
had not been foreseen and was not fortified.
 But as the
attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridneva), and
as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a
general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first
and chief action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the
twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
twenty-sixth.
 So it happened that throughout the whole battle
the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left
flank with but half as many men.
 At the
descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the
town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and
the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
foot.
 Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
its singers.
 The peasant drivers,
shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side.


Pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
one side of the road.
 The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre's head was
the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily.
 One of those sitting up in the cart had
probably been wounded in the cheek.


they sang their soldiers' dance song.


As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the
metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
merriment.


"Oh, the coxcombs!" he muttered reproachfully.
.
.


The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.
.


"Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?" he
said, exchanging glances with his young companion.
 That's what you must
do.


"You think so?.
 Go up the hillock
and you'll see.
.
"

But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
.
 You know, Count, there'll be a battle tomorrow.
 Out of an army
of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,
and we haven't stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for
six thousand.


Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.

Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding
down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Valuevo visible
about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed.


All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.


"That's his again," said the officer.
 You see down there where
the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there's the bridge.
 The left
flank.
" here the officer paused.
 Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevardino, you see,
where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing--now it is
over there, do you see that village and the smoke? That's Semenovsk,
yes, there," he pointed to Raevski's knoll.
.
 First along
the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms
reversed.


Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the
procession.
.
 Behind,
before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,
ran, and bowed to the ground.


At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had
been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began.
 The hot
rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.
 As soon as the tired chanters, who were
singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and
mechanically to sing: "Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of
God," and the priest and deacon chimed in: "For to Thee under God we all
flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection," there again kindled in
all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity
of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
the hill at Mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,
and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
 Behind Kutuzov was Bennigsen and
the suite.


"Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?" said a voice.
 Boris was elegantly dressed, with a slightly
martial touch appropriate to a campaign.
"

"Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.
 He meant to fortify that knoll
quite differently, but.


In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutuzov's
party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff.

Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure and the group gathered round him.
 It was
Dolokhov.


"He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!" was the answer.
 Now he wants to bob up again.
 He's been
proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy's picket
line at night.
 He's a brave fellow.
"

Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.


"Yes, yes.
"

"But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland
for which I am ready to die.
"

"And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his
skin, please think of me.
.
.


Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to
Pierre's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, without
raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted
conversation:

"The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die.


"Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness--for death--they have put
on clean shirts.
 Is
she well? My quarters are at your service.


"Those verses.
.
.
.


Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to
Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
 Then they rode
downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
of the plowed land, and reached some fleches * which were still being
dug.



At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino
Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
horsemen could be descried.
 At last those mounted men
rode away from the mound and disappeared.
 Pierre listened to him, straining each
faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but
was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
task.


Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with
much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military
importance.
 In front of Tuchkov's troops was some high ground not
occupied by troops.
 Bennigsen on his own authority ordered
the troops to occupy the high ground.
 Through a gap in the broken wall he
could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty year-old birches
with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of
oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
campfires--the soldiers' kitchens.
 But his thoughts--the simplest, clearest, and
therefore most terrible thoughts--would give him no peace.
 "Yes,
yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,
and tormented me," said he to himself, passing in review the principal
pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
white daylight of his clear perception of death.
 "Ah me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove
in the fable she was to pine apart from me.
.
"

"When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his
land, his air, his peasants.
 I shall not exist.
"

He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their
motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark.
.
 That all this should still
be, but no me.
 He rose
quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.


After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed.
 "Who's that?"
he cried.


The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov's squadron commander,
but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the
shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.
 It was
unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,
and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
his last visit to Moscow.
 "What brings you here? This is
unexpected!"

As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness--they
expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once.
.
"

"Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they
stop it?" said Prince Andrew sarcastically.
 "Well, and how's Moscow? And
my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?" he asked seriously.


"Yes, they have.
"





CHAPTER XXV


The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently
reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have
tea.


"Yes--that is, how do you mean?" said Pierre.
 "Not being a military man
I can't say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general
position.


"Oh!" said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince
Andrew.
 "Well, and what do you think of Kutuzov's appointment?" he
asked.


"I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know," replied Prince
Andrew.
.


"Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
enemy," said Prince Andrew with venomous irony.
 "It is very sound:
one can't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
marauding.
 But he could not understand
this," cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
involuntarily: "he could not understand that there, for the first time,
we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the
men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for
two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold.
 He is
unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
accurately as every German has to.
 "Why, one who foresees all
contingencies.
.
 The relative strength of bodies of troops can
never be known to anyone.
 Believe me," he went on, "if things
depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making
arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in
the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow's
battle will depend and not on those others.
.
 They rode close by
continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these
words:

"Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden.
" *


     * "Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of
     course one cannot take into account the loss of private
     individuals.
 That's all the same to him! That's what I was saying to
you--those German gentlemen won't win the battle tomorrow but will only
make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German
heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven't in their
hearts the one thing needed tomorrow--that which Timokhin has.
 Fine
teachers!" and again his voice grew shrill.
 Why take
prisoners? It's chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on
their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me
every moment.
 They should be executed!
Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been
said at Tilsit.
"

"Yes, yes," muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.
.
 And
when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the
determination of the troops would be quite different.
 Then all these
Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow
him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia
without knowing why.
 All the kings, except the Chinese,
wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the
highest rewards.


"They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill
and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for
having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they
announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed
the greater their achievement.
 And it doesn't do for man to taste of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil.
.
.


"Go, go! Before a battle one must have one's sleep out," repeated Prince
Andrew.
.


It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
expression of Prince Andrew's face was angry or tender.


For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
him or go away.
 and he had such kind.
 Prince Andrew smiled
now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes.
 And I?.
.
 and he is still alive and gay!"

Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began
pacing up and down in front of the shed.
 de Beausset, prefect
of the French Emperor's palace, arrived at Napoleon's quarters at
Valuevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from
Madrid.
 Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,
was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor's pampered body with an
expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau
de Cologne should be sprinkled.
 Napoleon's short hair was wet and
matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed
physical satisfaction.
.


"All right.
 Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too," he said,
nodding to the aide-de-camp.


"Yes, sire," and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the
tent.
 The result of
that battle had been deplorable.
 "I'll see you
later," he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had
prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
it with a cloth.


De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
presenting an envelope.
 Well, what is Paris saying?" he
asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
tone.


But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this
kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was
pleased to hear it from him.


"Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,"
replied de Beausset.
 An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
gold snuffbox, which he took.
 You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.


"Ha, what's this?" asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were
looking at something concealed under a cloth.
 He ordered the
portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed
round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of
Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.


And while he was doing M.
 It
ran:


Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for.
 Let our remotest posterity
recall your achievements this day with pride.


But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount.


"Take him away!" he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
the portrait.


The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolocha had
been dislocated by the capture of the Shevardino Redoubt on the
twenty-fourth, and part of the line--the left flank--had been drawn
back.
 It was evident to anyone,
military or not, that it was here the French should attack.
 To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the
fleches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though
the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement
through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.


After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.


These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm
and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:


At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
plain occupied by the Prince d'Eckmuhl will open fire on the opposing
batteries of the enemy.




These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows
oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,
related to Napoleon's orders to deal with four points--four different
orders.


In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche; which
were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
shower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts.






CHAPTER XXVIII


Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodino
because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the
orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world
have been changed.


If it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight or not to fight the
battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended on
his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been
the savior of Russia.
 Along that line of thought such a deduction is
indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest
(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre
of St.


Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of
St.
 The whole
army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry, ragged, and
weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk.


When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as compensation
for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been
in the battle before Moscow, they cried "Vive l'Empereur!" just as they
had cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at the sight of the portrait of the boy
piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would
have cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at any nonsense that might be told them.


Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former
occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon's cold on
the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.
 He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.
 When the time comes to
set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and
the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you
ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.


"I have neither taste nor smell," he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
 What can doctors cure? One can't cure anything.
 Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it
will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.
"

Rapp made no reply.
 "We shall
see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks
and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.
.
.
.
 Near by, the campfires were dimly
burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the
Russian line shone through the smoke.
 The weather was calm, and the
rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take
up their positions were clearly audible.
"

Napoleon nodded and walked away.
 The game had begun.
 It was the same panorama he had admired from that
spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and
covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the
bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it
through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden tinted
light and long dark shadows.
 The forest at the farthest extremity of
the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green
color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
was pierced beyond Valuevo by the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops.
 Without being aware of it he had come to the
bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino, which the French
(having occupied Borodino) were attacking in the first phase of the
battle.
.
 The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently
also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.


"Why haven't they carried him away?" Pierre was about to ask, but seeing
the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he
checked himself.


Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
adjutant to Raevski's Redoubt.


"Why.
 "I'll go up onto the knoll if I
may?"

"Yes, do.

But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up
and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,
their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,
cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the
regiment.


A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around
with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.


Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.


"Are you bowing to a friend, eh?" remarked another, chaffing a peasant
who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.
 This was followed by a burst of laughter.


"To the fifth gun, wheel it up!" came shouts from one side.
 "Awkward baggage!" he added
reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man's
leg.


"Now then, you foxes!" said another, laughing at some militiamen who,
stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.


Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck
by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking
backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.
 No one any
longer took notice of Pierre.
 The young officer, with his face
still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever.


The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which
Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly.
 Some militiamen who were
entering the battery ran back.


The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
Pierre.
 He had no
time to realize who these men were.


But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that
the soldier shouting "Brothers!" was a prisoner, and that another man
had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run
into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue
uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something.
 The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by
his collar.
 The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their
heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre
that the French officer's head had been torn off, so swiftly had he
ducked it.


Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall.
 Without further thought
as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery
and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,
it seemed to him, caught at his feet.


The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was
a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded.
 Crowds of
wounded--some known to Pierre and some unknown--Russians and French,
with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on
stretchers from the battery.
 The young officer still sat in
the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth
wall.
 The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if
the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved.
 The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the
troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
on the farther side and wait.


The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only
occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements
without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run.
 All
their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of
disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
the fields on which these men were floundering about.
 As soon as they
left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their
superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them
under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
promptings of the throng.
 In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant
to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.


"Reinforcements?" said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at
the adjutant--a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat's
own--as though he did not understand his words.
 It was Belliard.


"Sire, the prince.


"Send Claparede's division, sire," replied Berthier, who knew all the
divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.
 "I can't send Claparede.
 They all asked
for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their
positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was
melting away.
 de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,
came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His
Majesty.
.
 So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,
Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on.
 He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
him experienced in the art of war.


But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of
a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
efforts had been expended.


When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in
which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the
concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
Russians still holding their ground--a terrible feeling like a nightmare
took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
him occurred to his mind.
 Yes, it was like
a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
his helplessness.
 He sat silently on a campstool
below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees.
 Berthier
approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
ascertain the position of affairs.
"

He mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.
 The roar of
guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
vivants.
 Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semenovsk, and through the
smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him.


"At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard
destroyed!" he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.
 By long years of military experience he knew, and with
the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to
direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he
knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by
the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force
called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it
in as far as that was in his power.


At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the
French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was wounded.


"Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly," he
said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Wurttemberg
who was standing behind him.
 Still, it is better to
wait before we rejoice.


When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk, Kutuzov,
guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin's looks that the
news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbinin's
arm, led him aside.
"

Kutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position.
 "Der alte Herr" (as in their own set the Germans
called Kutuzov) "is making himself very comfortable," thought Wolzogen,
and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutuzov he began to
report to "the old gentleman" the position of affairs on the left flank
as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
it.
.
.
 Tell General Barclay from me that his information
is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
me, the commander in chief, than to him.
 If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what
you don't know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform
him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow," said Kutuzov
sternly.


Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently
aside, marveling at "the old gentleman's" conceited stupidity.
"

"Kaysarov!" Kutuzov called to his adjutant.


It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
farthest links of that chain.
 The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred
paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
mood.
 Talk was rarely heard in the
ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful
shot and the cry of "stretchers!" was heard.
 It was
as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,
commonplace occurrences.
.
.
 Ah,
they don't see it!" came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
regiment.


Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up
and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the
meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.
 The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded
carried away, and the ranks closed up.
 All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were
unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
situation.
.
 A whizz and a thud! Five
paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared.
 Probably many
had been hit--a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.


"Look out!" came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird
whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped
with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the
battalion commander's horse.
 The horse's terror infected the men.
 The smoking shell spun like a top between him
and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and
the meadow.
.

From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large
stain on the grass.
.
.
 I say, Fedor!" said the foremost peasant.


"Now that's right!" said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into
step.


"Your excellency! Eh, Prince!" said the trembling voice of Timokhin, who
had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.
 The dressing station consisted of
three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.

In the wood, wagons and horses were standing.
 Disregarding the officers' orders, the soldiers stood leaning
against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend
the difficult problem of what was taking place before them.
 The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka.
 He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the
whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.
 He had been wounded in the
head and leg by bullets.
 Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a
crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.
 "If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there
wouldn't have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely.
 "And what will be there, and what has there been
here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in
this life I did not and do not understand.
 He evidently wanted a
little respite.
 The pitiful groans from all
sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted
him.
 On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by
the uniform thrown down beside him.
 On the other table, round which many people were
crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.
 One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all
the time with a feverish tremor.
 When he had
finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the
spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.
 Then he made a sign to
someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to
lose consciousness.
 As soon as Prince
Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the
lips, and hurried away.


After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a
blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time.


The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and
trying to quiet him.
.
 Whether because he
was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,
or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or
because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
was groaning so piteously--he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and
almost happy tears.


The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
and with the boot still on.


"Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those
who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on
earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand--that
is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me
had I lived.

The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility
of suffering and death for himself.
 The
one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom.
 But when he
had been on the Semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo.


An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they
still held their ground.


"Sire?" asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
 He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they
were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and
all humanity.


Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I
too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance.
 Those ideas were
stolen from me.
 In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to
the peoples as clerk to master.
 The
Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;
the Russian army in its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in the various
battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow
cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want
in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian
army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time
it reached Vilna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at Kalisch less
than eighteen thousand.
"


He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the
horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul.
 Others held
their ground and continued to fire.
.
.
.
 All the generals, officers,
and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the
flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.


It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,
after all their experience of previous battles--when after one tenth of
such efforts the enemy had fled--experienced a similar feeling of terror
before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly
at the end as at the beginning of the battle.
 Only when we have admitted
the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical
progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of
this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.


In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.
 But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all
those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
units.


The second method is to consider the actions of some one man--a king or
a commander--as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas
the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a
single historic personage.
 But however small the
units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,
or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of
many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is
in itself false.
 It is merely necessary to select some larger or
smaller unit as the subject of observation--as criticism has every
right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
arbitrarily selected.
 What was the cause of
this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.


The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and
doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling
these sayings and doings "the Revolution"; then they give a detailed
biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;
tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that
is why this movement took place and those are its laws.


"But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;
every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
great men," says history.
 But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the
unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the
force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds.
 I see only a
coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the
hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the
oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine
moving, or of the winds of spring.


To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and
study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
moved.
 The Russian
army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached, and again
from Smolensk to Borodino.
 Every soldier in
Napoleon's army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.


The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and
consolidated.

Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor.


For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
made by generals--as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may
imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle--the
questions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not do
this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fili?
Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning Moscow? and
so on.
 People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,
the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
commander in chief.
 The activity of a commander in chief does not at all
resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in
our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of
troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our
plans from some given moment.
 The commander in chief is always in the midst of a
series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the
whole import of an event that is occurring.
 Moment by moment the event
is imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,
uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the
midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,
authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is
continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,
which constantly conflict with one another.
 But a commander
in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not
one proposal but dozens simultaneously.
 For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to
cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from
Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire.
 And the order to retreat
carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road.






CHAPTER III


When Ermolov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position, told
the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow
and that they must retreat, Kutuzov looked at him in silence.
 No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all
these men.
 They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
height the situation demanded.
 And all these groups, while talking
among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose
bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
overhear them.
 Others argued that a mistake had
been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
before.
 From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless
commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the
battle would still not take place.
 How could the commanders lead their troops to
a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade
officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the
position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced
as they were of defeat.
 His aim was as clear as daylight
to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutuzov who had
brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if
it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not
given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow.
 One terrible question
absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone.
 And not only did he love power to
which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski,
under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced
that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against
the Emperor's wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen
commander in chief.
 He sat, sunk deep
in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed
to pinch his neck.
 His adjutant
Kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
Kutuzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood
that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.


Bennigsen opened the council with the question: "Are we to abandon
Russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to
defend it?" A prolonged and general silence followed.
 Is it better to give up Moscow
without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion," and he
sank back in his chair.
 Whether
feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not
to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course
of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned.
 For instance.
" Kutuzov seemed to reflect,
searching for an example, then with a clear, naive look at Bennigsen he
added: "Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count
well remembers, and which was.
.


The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all
felt that there was no more to be said.
 "Gentlemen,
I have heard your views.
"

After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.


When he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time with his
elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:
"When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was
that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?"

"I did not expect this," said he to his adjutant Schneider when the
latter came in late that night.


After the battle of Borodino the abandonment and burning of Moscow was
as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.
 And as soon as the
enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,
while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.
 They went away even before the battle of Borodino and
still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchin's calls to defend Moscow
or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of
the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were
to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchin wrote in
his broadsheets.






CHAPTER VI


Helene, having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg, found
herself in a difficult position.
 I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!
Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I
render account only to God and to my conscience," she concluded, laying
her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to
heaven.
"

"You won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you.


The prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught,
said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had
never been her husband's wife, and that she had been sacrificed.


"But the law, religion.
" said the prince, already yielding.
 A dance,
for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with
her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de
Jobert came to see Helene when she was alone, and after that often came
again.



One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt
down before the altar to which she was led.
 A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had
now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the
Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.
 You swerved from it.
"

But suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one of her
bewitching smiles: "But I think that having espoused the true religion I
cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.
 He was
delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress, but could
not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.


"Let us understand one another, Countess," said he with a smile, and
began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments.


So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.

She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only
way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her.


Only Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had come to Petersburg that
summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express
an opinion contrary to the general one.
 It is done in all the
brothels," and with these words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her wide
sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,
moved across the room.
.


Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,
and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
Helene always has--men friends who can never change into lovers--once
gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.
 "As a true friend,
I have thought and thought again about your affair.
 You see, if you
marry the prince"--he meant the younger man--and he crooked one finger,
"you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will
displease the court besides.
 the prince would no longer be making
a mesalliance by marrying you," and Bilibin smoothed out his forehead.
"

Bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
 She was continually
tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned
a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the
idea.


"But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced.
'"
said the old princess.
 Dans ma
position j'ai des devoirs," * said Helene changing from Russian, in
which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,
into French which suited it better.
 In my position I have obligations.
.
 The young man who had
entered took no notice of her.
 The princess nodded to her daughter and
sidled out of the room.
 "She is right, but how
is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so
simple," she thought as she got into her carriage.
N.



And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful
keeping--Your friend Helene.


Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozhaysk road, Pierre sat down
by the roadside.
 The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
the smell of smoke.
 Pierre sat up and sighed.


"And who may you be?" one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: "If you want to eat
we'll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
man.
"

"I, I.
.


"Would you like a little mash?" the first soldier asked, and handed
Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.


Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called
the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food
he had ever tasted.


"Where have you to go to? Tell us!" said one of them.
 The groom recognized Pierre in the
darkness by his white hat.


The soldiers stopped.






CHAPTER IX


Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,
he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans
and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and
dread of death seized him.
 Filled with fright he opened his eyes and
lifted his head from under his cloak.
 They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out
clearly and sharply from everyone else.
 "Yes, he died, and I did not know he was
alive.
 For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre
opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but
now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.


Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that
someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that
day had evoked them.
 "Simplicity is submission to the
will of God; you cannot escape from Him.
 They do
not talk, but act.
 The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.
 Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts
together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness
them!" he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these
words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
question that tormented him.
.
.
"

It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him.
 On the
way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of
that of Prince Andrew.






CHAPTER X


On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow.
 He asks you to come to him at once on a
very important matter.
" said another, pointing to a printed
sheet he held in his hand.


"That's another matter.
 Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;
things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our
own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and
will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet
so I hold my peace.
 That will help them to get well quicker.
 I,
too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout
with both.
.


"And what does he mean by 'One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the
lookout with both'?" asked Pierre.
"

"But what did you hear?"

"Well, they say," continued the adjutant with the same smile, "that
the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad.
.
"

An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a
cross round his neck, approached the speaker.
 He gave orders to investigate the matter.

But the point is that the count was much annoyed.
 'How could you have
written it yourself?' said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that
was lying on the table.
 'Here it is! You did not write it yourself but
translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don't even know
French, you fool.
 The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.
 "We have heard of your prowess.
"

"Yes, I am a Mason," Pierre replied.
 Klyucharev has
been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of
building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
their fatherland.
"

"But what did Klyucharev do wrong, Count?" asked Pierre.
"

"There we are!" Rostopchin shouted at Pierre louder than before,
frowning suddenly.
 "Vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will
be punished as he deserves," said he with the vindictive heat with which
people speak when recalling an insult.
 And I will knock the nonsense out of
anybody"--but probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezukhov who
so far was not guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre's hand in a
friendly manner, "We are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven't
time to be polite to everybody who has business with me.
 Oh, by the by!" he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,
"is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
fathers of the Society of Jesus?"

Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin's room more sullen and angry
than he had ever before shown himself.

They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him.


"They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed.
.
.
 one must harness.
" And going to his bed he threw himself on
it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.


From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of
Bezukhov's household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again
or knew where he was.
 On the twenty-eighth of August
he arrived.
 Though she concealed from
him her intention of keeping him under her wing, Petya guessed her
designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
when with her--might "become womanish" as he termed it to himself--he
treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached
himself exclusively to Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly
brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.
 Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino were
brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,
and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
out by the other gates.

Some said there had been another battle after Borodino at which the
French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the
Russian army had been destroyed.


During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole
Rostov family was absorbed in various activities.
 Sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
things packed.

Nicholas' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in
her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention
of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.


"I was never pleased at Bolkonski's engagement to Natasha," said the
countess, "but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a
presentiment that it would happen.
 But despite
her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the
difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
was busy for whole days.
 The count and countess turned to her when they
had any orders to give.

Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army.
 Natasha
was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,
and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and
holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which
she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.
 She was roused from her reverie
by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the
sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch.


The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.


Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.

Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.
.
.


Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole
manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of
her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some
reflection--as if considering in how far the thing was possible--replied
in the affirmative.


"Your Papa must be told, though," said Mavra Kuzminichna.
"

"There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we
put them into the wing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we must ask
permission.


"Are you asleep, Mamma?"

"Oh, what sleep-?" said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping
into a doze.


"Mamma darling!" said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her
face close to her mother's, "I am sorry, forgive me, I'll never do it
again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have brought
some wounded here--officers.


"What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand anything
about it," said the countess.


"We've stayed too long!" said the count with involuntary vexation.
"

"Papa, is it all right--I've invited some of the wounded into the
house?" said Natasha.


At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had heard.
 When returning by that street she had
been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of
the shop.
 The
old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the
house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
people, and flurrying them still more.
 Natasha, with the ardor characteristic
of all she did suddenly set to work too.


"No, wait a minute, please.
 "These aren't needed," said she, putting aside some plates of
Kiev ware.
 The count was not angry even when they told him that Natasha
had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her
to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might
be corded up.


That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and Mavra
Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the
Rostovs' yard.
 On the box beside the driver sat a venerable
old attendant.


"Well, perhaps," said he with a sigh.


The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
"

And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.


The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his
head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped
beside Mavra Kuzminichna.


"O, Lord Jesus Christ!" she murmured.


But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him
into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss'.
 Thirty carts could not save all the wounded
and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's
own family.

The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to
a pale young officer with a bandaged arm.
"

"Well, that's right.
.
.
 Just unload one or two carts.
" said the count, muttering
some indefinite order.


But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer's
face had already sealed the order.


"What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.
.
 Countess dear.
.
 I don't consent, my dear, I don't!
Do as you please! It's the government's business to look after the
wounded; they know that.
 Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they cleared
out everything two days ago.
 If you have no pity on me, have some for the
children.


"But I heard," said Natasha.


He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the
army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.

So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
domestic reasons.
 He
looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.
 Our corps was
stationed on a hillside.
 One misses Mitenka at such times.

There won't be any end to it.
 I wish to give her a surprise, you
see.
 Please let me
have one, I will pay the man well, and.
"

"If it's inconvenient, please don't," said Berg.
 "Only I so wanted it,
for dear Vera's sake.

She did not answer.
 "Vasilich told me.
 I consider.
.
"

"I consider," Natasha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to
Petya, "I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so.
.

Are we despicable Germans?"

Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and
letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
headlong up the stairs.

"They will be left!.
.
.
.
 Please forgive me, darling.
.
.
.


"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?.
 "We will still
take all the most necessary things.


The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the strange
order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife's name,
confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
trunks to the storerooms.
 When they understood that order the servants
set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal.
 It no longer seemed
strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
away but that had seemed the only thing to do.
 The news that carts were to be had spread
to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the
Rostovs' yard.
"

They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
house two doors off.


"Why, didn't you know, Miss?" replied the maid.
"

The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm, glanced
around.


The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.
 "If everything is ready let us start.


"What is it? What has happened?"

"Nothing.
.
 No.
.
 "Don't you know
I can't sit like that?"

And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an
aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
seat.
 From thirty years' experience
he knew it would be some time yet before the order, "Be off, in God's
name!" would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said
he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again
be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill.
 Those who were to remain in Moscow
walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.
 Occasionally she leaned out of the
carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
wounded in front of them.
 Really," said Natasha, "look, look!"

"No, it's not he.
 How can you talk such nonsense?"

"Mamma," screamed Natasha, "I'll stake my head it's he! I assure you!
Stop, stop!" she cried to the coachman.
 Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at
first understand him.


"What is the matter, Count?" asked the countess in a surprised and
commiserating tone.
"

"Yes, I was," Pierre answered.
.


"Oh, yes, in a minute; wait.
.
 But there were
some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate
the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
him.


He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
Patriarch's Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev's house was.


Having reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs' house,
where he had not been for a long time past.
 He went up to the gate.
"

Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime.


Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre
always sitting in the same attitude.


"Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?"

"Oh yes!" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly.
 "Look
here," he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down
at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, "I say, do you
know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?"

"We heard so," replied the man.
 "Will you have something to
eat?"

"No, but I want something else.


All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's study,
and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
talking to himself.
 Kutuzov himself had driven round by side
streets to the other side of Moscow.
 La
voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait temps," * said he, and
dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and
summoned Lelorgne d'Ideville, the interpreter.



     * "That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy
     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city.
 It seemed
strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,
had at last been realized.
 Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what
light must I appear to them!" thought he, thinking of his troops.

"Yet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses
scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine.
.
.
 I will tell the deputation that I did not,
and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false
policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in
Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.
"

"Qu'on m'amene les boyars," * said he to his suite.
"


A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
boyars.
 His speech to
the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination.
" Or no, it should
be simply: Maison de ma Mere, *(2) he concluded.
 They were not alarmed by the fact
that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact
seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor--without putting
him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous--that he had been
awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left
in Moscow but no one else.
.
 Faster and faster, vying with
one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the
clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
of mingling shouts.


Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as
the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
horse, paced for a long time by the Kammer-Kollezski rampart, awaiting
the deputation.


The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.

Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the
combs, but no longer in their former state of purity.
 All is neglected
and foul.
 In another corner two old bees
are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,
without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
intent.


When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was
empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
continued to walk to and fro.


"My carriage!" he said.


He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the
suburb.


While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
Kremlin, were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges, a great many
soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski gate, back up the hill
to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take
things not belonging to them.
 Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar.
 Tradesmen and their assistants
(of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite
bewildered.

But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run
farther away.


"The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.
" he shouted to three infantrymen
without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
slipping past him into the Bazaar passage.
.
"

Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
 "Please step inside, your honor!"

"Talk indeed!" cried the thin one.
 Can they be saved when the army
has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against God's might our hands can't fight.


"It's not my business!" he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of
the passages.


The officer mounted his horse and rode after him.
 Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.
 He was told by his fellow officers that the screams
of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
General Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,
had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
bridge.


"Aunt, I did it gently," said the boy.


"I'll give you something gently, you monkey you!" cried Mavra
Kuzminichna, raising her arm threateningly.


Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
next--to drink tea in the servants' wing with Vasilich, or into the
storeroom to put away what still lay about.
 Ah,
what a pity.
.
 it can't be helped!" said he in a tone of vexation and
placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.


"You see," he suddenly said, "I am a kinsman of the count's and he has
been very kind to me.
.
"

Mavra Kuzminichna grew abashed and confused.


"If the count had been at home.


Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran
almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yauza bridge to
overtake his regiment.
 The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were
most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be
bare.
 In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows
in the passage and porch.


"Stop it!" he exclaimed peremptorily.


The bloodstained smith went beside them.


"He should pay folks off properly," a thin workingman, with frowning
brows and a straggly beard, was saying.
" the reader
went on, and then paused ("Do you see," shouted the youth victoriously,
"he's going to clear up the whole affair for you.
.
 The people's minds
were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
comprehensible--it was what any one of them might have said and
therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should
not say.
 The tall youth moved his lips and
swayed from side to side.

Why not? He'll explain".


The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count
Rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
stop.


"Your honor.
.
 "Don't let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!" shouted
different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.


"There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
perish.
 If one accepts this twofold aim all
Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable.


All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
public tranquillity.


On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of
Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability
of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the
retreating troops were filling it.


Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and
impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to
be guiding.


But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing
hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not
even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when
self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,
abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all
the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchin
suddenly appeared senseless.
 I had Moscow
firmly in hand.
 And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!
Traitors!" he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and
traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
which he found himself.
.
.


To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully
prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody
would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.

Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have
horses, let them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them to the French.
.
.


The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, and sat
in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.


In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it
is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is
kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts.
 While the
sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,
holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
on to.


Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light,
luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the
handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a
better view of the whole crowd.


"It is, your excellency," replied the adjutant.
 But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency--I hardly
managed to get away from it.
 And this
thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,
something on which to vent his rage.


"Yes, your excellency.
 "Thank you for
coming.


For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
the silence continued.


While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchin
stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.
 At
the count's first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye.


All eyes were fixed on him.


"He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
Bonaparte.
"

The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to
one another.
.
.


"Cut him down! I command it.
.


"Draw sabers!" cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.


And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.
 A
similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd.
 Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering
his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd.
 And the
screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd.
 It was a long
time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten
almost to death.


"Hit him with an ax, eh!.
.
 Use the hatchet!.


"O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?" voices
in the crowd could be heard saying.
 "Quite a young fellow too.
 must
have been a merchant's son.
 and they say he's not the right
one.
.
.
 Oh, the people.
.
 Aren't
they afraid of sinning?.
" said the same mob now, looking with pained
distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its
livid face stained with blood and dust.
.
 Where are you going?.


Count Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in
the direction indicated.
 He hastily
took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
Sokolniki.


When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear
the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent.
 But this
was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled disdainfully
at himself.
 "I had other duties," thought he.
 "The people had to be
appeased.
 Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
public good"--and he began thinking of his social duties to his family
and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not himself as
Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore Vasilyevich
Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as
governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar.
"

Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew physically
calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil
his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too.


The Sokolniki field was deserted.
 Only at the end of it, in front of the
almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white
and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
gesticulating.
 They
stoned me, crucified me.
.
.
 faster!" he cried in a
trembling voice to his coachman.
 The caleche flew over the ground as
fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopchin
still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,
bloodstained face of "the traitor" in the fur-lined coat.
.
 The mob, the traitor.
.

And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchin,
took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
to drive on the carts that blocked the way.
 Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced
detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le
Kremlin.
 The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if
it was far to the Kremlin.
 The porter, listening in perplexity to the
unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and
slipped behind the others.


"Good!" said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,
ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.
 When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka Street they
halted and drew in the Square.
 A few
infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate.
 The cries from the gates ceased.
 The
guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,
and an officer gave the word "Fire!" This was followed by two whistling
sounds of canister shot, one after another.
 He grasped a musket
and took aim at the French.
 When five weeks
later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army.
 They
were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which
seemed to him valuable or useful.
 Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the
French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they
carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let
go of its nuts.


Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day
forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any
violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call
for that very evening.
 The
cavalry, on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned and
finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,
all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better.
 Many of
them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and
quarreled and even fought with other companies for them.
 The officers
followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
the same.



The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de
Rostopchine, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French.
 Deserted
Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
which sparks continually fall for several days.
 Moscow was set on fire by
the soldiers' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of
enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own.
 He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich's house, on the plea of
sorting the deceased's books and papers, only in search of rest from
life's turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alexeevich was
connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite
contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
drawn.
 When
Gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected.


Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate.

And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
design excited him still more.

The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for
everything conventional, artificial, and human--for everything the
majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world.
 Pierre had
first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Sloboda
Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life--all that
men so painstakingly acquire and guard--if it has any worth has so only
by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.
 Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind.
 In his
fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.


"Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!" he thought.
.


While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself
in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared
the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before but now quite
transformed.


His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted.
.
 Am I not right, sir?"

He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.


"Who are you? Bonaparte!.
" shouted Makar Alexeevich.
 Come to your room, please, and rest.
 "Board them!"

"Catch hold!" whispered Gerasim to the porter.


They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.


The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
a tipsy, hoarse voice.


Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from
the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.






CHAPTER XXVIII


Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the
half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon
as the French entered.


There were two of them.
 One was an officer--a tall, soldierly, handsome
man--the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and
thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression.



    * "Good day, everybody!"


No one gave any reply.



    * "Are you the master here?"


Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.


"Quartier, quartier, logement!" said the officer, looking down at the
little man with a condescending and good-natured smile.
 "Well, does no one speak French in this establishment?" he
asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre's eyes.
.
.
 "But I have
had a lucky escape this time," he added, pointing to the damaged plaster
of the wall.


"Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred," said Pierre rapidly,
quite forgetting the part he had intended to play.


"You have saved my life! You are French.


Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre's feelings
were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man's animated
obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.
 A Frenchman never
forgets either an insult or a service.
 You are an officer.
 You belong to the gentry?" he concluded with a shade of
inquiry in his tone.
 Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan
and placed a bottle of claret in it.
 You see, I have bullets enough in my
body already.
 Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of
fire was worth seeing.
 It was a tough job you set us there, my word!
You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught
there, I should be ready to begin again.
 The
great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!" continued the Frenchman.


"Ha, ha, ha!" The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
Pierre on the shoulder.
 "Paris?.
 I don't know what, that.
.
 You have been to Paris and have
remained Russian.
.
.

We are nice to know.
.
.


"The Emperor," Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
embarrassed, "is the Emperor.
.


The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.


The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice
asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,
and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
occupied.
 The
captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.
 It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him.
 He was
tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness.
 Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
do it.
 He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
carry out his intention.


The Frenchman's chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
him.
 I won't say another word to him," thought Pierre.


The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful.
 He paced up and
down the room twice.
.
"

"How do you say it?" the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.


Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine.
 The captain looked at Pierre
by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
on his companion's face.
 Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in
his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.
 "Have I
upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?" he asked Pierre.


"Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
you.


"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you," he now seemed
to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her
smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair.
 He began to explain that he
understood love for a women somewhat differently.

Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in
the world, and especially therefore above himself.
.
" he muttered.


More than anything else in Pierre's story the captain was impressed by
the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there
concealing his name and station.
 To the left of the house on the Pokrovka a
fire glowed--the first of those that were beginning in Moscow.


Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion.
 The countess said
she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at
Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
wounded man.


In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high
body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another
fire.


"See how it's flaring," said one.


"But what do you think, Daniel Terentich? Doesn't it look as if that
glow were in Moscow?" remarked one of the footmen.
.
.
 It's windy and dry.


"Just look! See what it's doing now.
 O Lord! You can even see the crows
flying.
 His voice was calm and deliberate.
 "Mother Moscow, the white.






CHAPTER XXXI


The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was
burning.
 Sonya
and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him.
 Only
Natasha and the countess remained in the room.


The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry.
 Natasha,
pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just
where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father's
words.
 She had been in
this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sonya, to the surprise
and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found
it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew's wound and of his being
with their party.


"Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!" said she.
 I'll lie down at once," said Natasha.


When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously
wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many
questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And
could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see
him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,
she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving
what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would
still be told the same.
 She was
planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
in her mind.
 The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not
know, and this alarmed and tormented her.
 The countess exchanged
a look with Sonya.
"

"Oh, yes.
 The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the
adjutant was heard.


She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,
damp earthen floor of the passage.






CHAPTER XXXII


Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
ambulance station on the field of Borodino.

The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
remained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked
to be taken out and given some tea.
 He felt Prince Andrew's pulse, and to his surprise and
dissatisfaction found it had improved.
 He drank it eagerly, looking with
feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
remember something.


Timokhin crept along the bench to him.


"What book?"

"The Gospels.
 "I have not got one.
 The uncomfortable position in
which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,
and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
stillness of the night.


His mind was not in a normal state.
 A healthy man can tear himself away from the
deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
then return again to his own thoughts.
 Most
diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously.
 "A happiness
lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act
on man--a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving.
.
 While listening to this whispering and feeling
the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and
heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
flopped against his pillow and his face.
 But besides this there was something else of
importance.
 It was something white by the door--the statue of a sphinx,
which also oppressed him.
?
That's enough, please leave off!" Prince Andrew painfully entreated
someone.
.
.
 It is the very essence of the soul.
 And he understood her
feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse.


"Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is," thought Prince Andrew,
trying to drive that face from his imagination.
 But the face remained
before him with the force of reality and drew nearer.
.


"Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!" faltered Natasha in a scarcely
audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just
touching it with her lips.

Timokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had
long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare
body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.
 "Please go away,
madam!"

At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her
daughter's absence, knocked at the door.


Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew
die in her daughter's arms during the journey--as, judging by what
the doctor said, it seemed might easily happen--she could not oppose
Natasha.
 Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded
man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former
engagement would be renewed, no one--least of all Natasha and Prince
Andrew--spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which
hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia, shut out all other
considerations.






CHAPTER XXXIII


On the third of September Pierre awoke late.

Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved
stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered
where he was and what lay before him that very day.
"

Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but
hastened to act.

But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets.
 But as
his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving
to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the pistol,
and hid it under his waistcoat.
 The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,
in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the barges on the Moskva
River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov Bridge, were all ablaze.


Pierre's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there
to the church of St.
 Both
the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise.
 The French followed him with
astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the
other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no
attention to them.
 And even had he not been hindered by
anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,
for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than four hours previously on his
way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the Kremlin, and was now sitting in
a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kremlin, giving
detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately
to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the
inhabitants.
 But Pierre, though he felt that something
unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was
approaching the fire.


By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household
goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks.
 On the
ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,
prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap.
 This woman,
swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs.
 The woman's husband, a short,
round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with
sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair
smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was
moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging
some garments from under them.


As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.
 help
us, somebody," she muttered between her sobs.
.
 Ooh!"

"Don't, Mary Nikolievna!" said her husband to her in a low voice,
evidently only to justify himself before the stranger.

"You have no heart, you don't feel for your own child! Another man would
have rescued her from the fire.
.


"Oh, dear sir!" she cried, seizing him by the legs.
 "My benefactor, set
my heart at ease.
.


The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,
sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path.
 Pierre felt
as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon.
 He held his head
higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps
he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarskoy.



    * "You can't pass!"


"This way, uncle," cried the girl.
 "We'll pass through the side street,
by the Nikulins'!"

Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.


"It's here, close by," said she and, running across the yard, opened a
gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden
wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely.


"Which is it? Which is your house?" he asked.


The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the
whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and
the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds
and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense
sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced
on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration.
 It had a
peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down.


Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen
who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal
articles.


"What does this fellow want?" shouted one of them referring to Pierre.


"There's a child in that house.
"

"Where is it? Where?" said Pierre.
 "Good-by, Fatty.
 We must be human, we are all mortal you
know!" and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
comrades.
 But he made an effort not to throw
the child down and ran with her to the large house.
 He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods
that had been dragged out of the houses.
 Pierre took no notice
of them.
 He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
frightened, sickly little face.
 That must
be either Mary Nikolievna's or the Ivanovs'!"

"He says 'a woman,' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady," remarked a house
serf.


"Do you know her? She's thin, with long teeth," said Pierre.
 He was looking at
the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.
 The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a
long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements
and with an idiotic expression of face.
 The little
barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,
saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
man at once began pulling off his boots.


"Here, take the child!" said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
woman, handing the little girl to her.
 But his comrade, throwing down
the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.
 Pierre remembered nothing
of what happened after that.


"Lieutenant, he has a dagger," were the first words Pierre understood.
" Then he turned to Pierre.


"Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary," remarked the officer.
 "And
ask him who he is," he added.


"What does that woman want?" asked the officer.
 His elation increased at the sight of the
little girl he had saved.






BOOK TWELVE: 1812





CHAPTER I


In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties
of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fedorovna, the Tsarevich, and others,
drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones.
 Prince Vasili himself, famed for
his elocution, was to read it.


The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezukhova.
"

"You are speaking of the poor countess?" said Anna Pavlovna, coming
up just then.
 "I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little
better.


Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the
veil from the secret of the countess' malady, an unwary young man
ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called
in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
employ dangerous remedies.


"What? What's that?" asked Anna Pavlovna, securing silence for the mot,
which she had heard before.


"The Emperor returns these Austrian banners," said Bilibin, "friendly
banners gone astray and found on a wrong path," and his brow became
smooth again.


"Charming, charming!" observed Prince Vasili.
 *(2)


     * Our most gracious sovereign.



Though the source of M.


Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted to him,
which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that
as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the
latter.


But this lasted only a moment.
 "Conceal nothing
from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.
.


"Sire," he said, with respectful playfulness, "they are only afraid lest
Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be
persuaded to make peace.
"

He bent his head and was silent for some time.
 It still offers me more than my enemies suppose," said the
Emperor growing more and more animated; "but should it ever be ordained
by Divine Providence," he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes
shining with emotion, "that my dynasty should cease to reign on the
throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my
command, I shall let my beard grow to here" (he pointed halfway down his
chest) "and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather
than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
sacrifices I know how to appreciate.
 Having stood there a few
moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
with a vigorous movement.
 It appears so to us because we see only the general historic
interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
that people had.
 Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
public interest from being felt or even noticed.

Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,
who discussed Russia's position at the time involuntarily introduced
into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
actions no one could possibly be guilty of.


As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being
sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without
regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but
with the greatest pleasure--which he did not conceal and which his
comrades fully understood.


The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was
evidently pleased with his military designation and rank.


"You are Count Ilya Rostov's son? My wife was a great friend of your
mother's.
 The Italian
was, as it were, a war trophy.
 Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him
that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him
cordially though with dignity and restraint.
 Jauntily shifting the position of his
legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and
admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in
their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he
wished to run away with a certain lady here in Voronezh.
.


The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily.
 "Come, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?"

"Oh, yes, Aunt.
.
.

Oho! How you blush.
.
.
 Oh, what a fellow you are!"

The governor's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with
a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most
important personages of the town.


"Very pleased, mon cher," she then said, holding out her hand to
Nicholas.
 "Pray come and see me.
.
 "She will really begin to arrange a
match.
.
?" And on taking leave of the governor's wife,
when she again smilingly said to him, "Well then, remember!" he drew her
aside.
 I will tell you the
truth.
 And it must needs happen
that I should meet her just when Natasha's engagement had been broken
off.
.
.
.
 So you see.
.
.
 She was sad.
 Assuming that she
did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say
to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed
undeservedly cold and then to mean too much.
 More than anything she
feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
soon as she saw him.


But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
room that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed no confusion,
only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
and radiant light.
 Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing
room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise.
 And above all, what tact and
grace!" thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 From the moment she recognized that dear,
loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
speak and act apart from her own will.
 Evidently she could speak of Russia's
misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near
her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him.
 Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if
understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
good natured playfulness.


As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and
Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all
the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to
Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice
versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary.


Though Rostov told the governor's wife that he would not make any
declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.
 He
knew that after his promise to Sonya it would be what he deemed base to
declare his feelings to Princess Mary.
 Princess Mary, having learned of
her brother's wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of
him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to
set off in search of Prince Andrew.


Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile
he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and
pity that immediately overcame him.
" she began and, prevented by agitation
from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,
went out, following her aunt.
 How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.

But no, he could not imagine that.
 He had long ago pictured to himself a
future with Sonya, and that was all clear and simple just because it
had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sonya, but it was
impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not
understand her but simply loved her.
 Why don't I pray for what I want?" he
suddenly thought.
.
 He recognized them by the handwriting and opened
Sonya's first.
 He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
eyes opened wide with fear and joy.


This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter
from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
there had seemed no escape.
 She wrote that the last unfortunate
events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs' Moscow
property--and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas
should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his silence and
coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to release him
from his promise and set him completely free.



It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow
or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my
love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I
beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of
everything, no one can love you more than does

Your Sonya


Both letters were written from Troitsa.
 In this letter the countess also
mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;
his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more
hope.


Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see Princess
Mary.

And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous
of Natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never
needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for
her and yet was beloved by everybody.
 And for the first time Sonya felt
that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling
was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,
or religion.
 Under the influence of this feeling Sonya, whose life of
dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered
the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and
resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him
free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.
 But when she heard of Prince Andrew's
presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for
Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God
did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas.
 In the next room sat the
count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was
calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.


"Natasha, what are you about? Come here!" said the countess.
.


"Yes! I knew it! Thank God!" murmured Sonya.
"

Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and
grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.
 Natasha opened it
cautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the
half-open door.


"You remember," said Sonya with a solemn and frightened expression.
.
 "I saw it then and told everybody, you
and Dunyasha.
 Those
eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and
readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.


"Yes, Mamma, I will write," said she.
 Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's relations with
Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she
was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in
which she was accustomed to live and loved to live.


But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the
new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as he had
been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not
recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only
No.
 In spite of this he was placed that day with the
other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was
required by an officer.
 He did not then realize the
significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with
horror.
 No flames
were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far
as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin.
 Here and
there he could see churches that had not been burned.
 The Kremlin, which
was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and
the belfry of Ivan the Great.
 But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be
seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
the French.


He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin's
Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
convent.
 He was conducted through a glass gallery,
an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low
study at the door of which stood an adjutant.
 Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting
a paper that lay before him, did not look up.


"I know that man," he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently
calculated to frighten Pierre.


Davout turned away.
 With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre
rapidly began:

"No, monseigneur," he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.

"No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me.
"

"Your name?" asked Davout.
 For some seconds they looked
at one another, and that look saved Pierre.
 At
that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
were brothers.


Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the
street where the house was.


But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.


Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began
buttoning up his uniform.


He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
question to Davout.
 It was not
Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way.
 The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of
Napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians, and
Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms.
 The
convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being
brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
huntsman.

Two more prisoners were led up.
 In the same way and with similar looks,
these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe
what was going to happen to them.
 The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.


"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!" shouted someone.
 The fifth man
was the factory lad in the loose cloak.
 The moment they laid hands on
him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre.
 His curiosity
and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch
at this fifth murder.
 Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.


They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.
 The twenty-four
sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the
circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.
 The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse.
 He looked at them without understanding
who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him.
 They were telling him something and
asking him something.
.
 that very prince who.
.
" some voice at the other
end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.
 On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw
that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused
Pierre's interest.
 While one hand hung up the first string the other was already
unwinding the band on the second leg.
 In this way, having carefully
removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following
one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
fixed above his head.
 The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,
and well rounded in these deft movements, in the man's well-ordered
arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at
the man without taking his eyes from him.
 "We had soup for
dinner and the potatoes are grand!"

Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
extremely pleasant to him.
 He thanked the soldier and began to eat.


"Well, are they all right?" said the soldier with a smile.


"Oh, I'm all right," said he, "but why did they shoot those poor
fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.
.
 "Ah, what a sin.
 I stayed accidentally," replied
Pierre.
"

"But it's all the same now," Pierre could not help saying.
 It so
happened.
 But he, my younger
brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife
behind.
 We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
soldier.
 The yard full of cattle,
the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the
youngest, at home.

'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young
woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before
him! Do you understand?' he says.
 But we are always judging, 'that's not well--that's
not right!' Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it
bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's empty! That's how it is.

Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf," he
muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.
 Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up and got warm,
you daughter of a bitch!" said Karataev, touching the dog that lay at
his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.


When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in his mind a most
vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,
kindly, and round.


His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical.
 He did not sing
like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,
evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were
always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his
face at such times was very serious.


He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not
complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
the whole of his army service.
 The proverbs, of which his talk was full,
were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers
employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
of profound wisdom.
 He would smile
joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word
or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
to himself.
 And Pierre began to feel in
the same way toward Karataev.
 His words and actions
flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance
exhales from a flower.
 That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary
attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long
journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.
 With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,
little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, Tikhon, and a
young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.
 Thanks to her activity and energy, which
infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslavl by the end of
the second week.

Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated her.
 She knew that she
loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
beloved, and was happy in regard to it.
 But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from
her grief and gave her strength.


The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince Andrew
was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that looked out at him from
the window.


Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.


"How is the prince?" she asked.


"His excellency is staying in the same house with them.
 The carriage steps clattered as they were let
down.
) Princess Mary ran up the steps.
 Oh, what a
lovely boy!"

The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sonya was
talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 The countess caressed the boy, and
the old count came in and welcomed the princess.
 He had changed very
much since Princess Mary had last seen him.


"Where is he?" she asked again, addressing them all.

She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.
 It was
plain that at that moment there was in Natasha's heart no thought of
herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.


"How.
.
 And suddenly, Natasha's lips
twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face
with her hands she burst into sobs.
 will see," was all Natasha could say.
 When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester
(Natasha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had
said that the festering might take a normal course.
 Then fever set in,
but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.
.
 Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now
tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at
him without tears.
"

In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there
was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
Natasha.


He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.
 She now
understood what had happened to him two days before.
 "It's a great pity," and he gazed
straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.


"And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?" Prince Andrew suddenly said,
evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them.
 "If you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you
to get married," he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having
found words he had long been seeking.


"Is it about Nicholas?" he asked.
 "But how simple it is.


"The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father
feedeth them," he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;
"but no, they will take it their own way, they won't understand!
They can't understand that all those feelings they prize so--all our
feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary.

We cannot understand one another," and he remained silent.
 He could scarcely read, and knew
nothing.
 And the more imbued he became with that
principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely
he destroyed that dreadful barrier which--in the absence of such
love--stands between life and death.


And so it was: in Sonya's place sat Natasha who had just come in
noiselessly.


"Can it or can it not be?" he now thought as he looked at her and
listened to the light click of the steel needles.
.


"How good it would be!" and taking her hand he kissed it.
 She set herself a task on her
stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.
 And there was the former
agitation and obscurity.
 Everything
depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it.
 He went, and
tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers.
 And that fear was the fear of death.
 His last superhuman efforts were vain
and both halves of the door noiselessly opened.
 It entered, and it was
death, and Prince Andrew died.


From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with
his awakening from sleep.
 Natasha went up, looked at
the dead eyes, and hastened to close them.
.
 The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,
must take the same terrible step.
 It may seem
to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference
between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East
because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the
earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there
were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets.
 But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
 But it is hard to understand why military writers,
and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound
conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon.


At the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a
direct retreat by the Nizhni road.
 This was the first indication of the necessity
of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course--a
direct retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod.


That movement from the Nizhni to the Ryazan, Tula, and Kaluga roads was
so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and
demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutuzov to take his army that
way.


Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is
called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
what had happened.


The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
merely lying low, the hunter did not know.
 Such is the present spirit
of my nation.
 Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown
to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
at once showed itself by countless signs.
 There was a substantial change
in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable.
 And at
once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased
activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.

The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been killed, and by
Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled.
 Very serious
consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
put A in B's place and B in D's, or on the contrary to put D in A's
place, and so on--as if anything more than A's or B's satisfaction
depended on this.
 A was undermining B, D was
undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.
 Only in the highest spheres did
all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true
reflection of what had to happen.



Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October
in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino) Since
September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy.



But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of
the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,
Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.
 Following the wounded hare he made
his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat's
army, encamped there without any precautions.
 The tightly coiled spring was
released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play.
 Despite all
his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge of
men, Kutuzov--having taken into consideration the Cossack's report, a
note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes
he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals
expressed the same wish--could no longer check the inevitable movement,
and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful--gave
his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.
 I haven't time just now," replied Ermolov, and
left the hut.
 As in the Austerlitz
dispositions, it was written--though not in German this time:

"The First Column will march here and here," "the Second Column will
march there and there," and so on; and on paper, all these columns
arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.


"No, and the general's out too.
 Ermolov was nowhere to be found
and no one knew where he was.


"What, outside our line?"

"They've put two regiments as outposts, and they're having such a spree
there, it's awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!"

The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino.
 In the refreshment room
and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands.
 You'll see what a mess there'll be tomorrow.
 But a little further on he saw infantry
regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,
eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel.
 He sent for an officer.
.
 Getting out of his caleche, he waited with
drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down.
 When
Eykhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,
Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame
for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance
for him to vent his wrath on.
 Another man, Captain Brozin,
who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the
same fate.
.


His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he
listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermolov did not come to see
him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovnitsyn,
and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
day.
 The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops
advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
could be faintly heard.
 Some columns, supposing they had reached their
destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,
but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
evidently should not have been.
 This
detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from
the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.


The offer was too tempting to be refused.
 After much disputing and arguing,
Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the
Polish sergeant.
 They disappeared into
the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen Grekov off, returned,
shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy
camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
campfires.
 Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
declivity to his right.


"Oh, it is really too late," said Count Orlov, looking at the camp.
 But it was impossible to make the
Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners.


The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they
formed into detachments and began firing.
 Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he
needed in his angry mood.
"

Kutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat's troops
were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he
halted for three quarters of an hour.


"That's how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!" said the
Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be
understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that
we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today.


A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during
a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course
taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and
never coincides with the direction of any one force.


If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
forces, but will always be a mean--what in mechanics is represented by
the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.


If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we
find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
are false.
 But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what
all the Russians of that day desired--to drive the French out of Russia
and destroy their army--it is quite clear that the battle of Tarutino,
just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that
stage of the campaign.
 The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient
capital.
 Yet Napoleon,
that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of
the army, took none of these steps.


Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his
army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he
wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.


In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the
personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that
guided the event.
 He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did
subsequently in 1813.
 We do not
know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt--where forty
centuries looked down upon his grandeur--for his great exploits there
are all told us by Frenchmen.
 We have paid for the right to look at the
matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.


With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Yakovlev,
who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,
and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he
considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopchin
had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Yakovlev to
Petersburg.
 And the scoundrel Rostopchin was
punished by an order to burn down his houses.
 But when not on duty they will only wear a red
ribbon round the left arm.
 You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will
wear on the left arm.
 But to achieve this
aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if
possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain
the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and
ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or
on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt
that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest
and most just of monarchs.



With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
and services to be again performed in the churches.
 Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions
and come to us without fear.
 And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where
you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full
assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the
city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of
the soil.
 The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those
living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their
supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on
the Mokhovaya Street and the other at the Provision Market.


Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,
to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the
paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to
co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and
confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!


With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,
reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed.
 The Emperor
rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his
preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were
established by his order.
 He caused the words Maison de ma
Mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch.
"

With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued
to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
and to suppress robbery.


With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.

Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out
Napoleon's wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French
soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of
another that: "The priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned
and locked up the church.
 The theaters set up in the
Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed again at once because the
actors and actresses were robbed.


Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect.
 The
French, collecting booty, cared only for gold.
"

"Robbery and pillaging continue.
 But it did not
go away.
 The news of that battle of Tarutino, unexpectedly received
by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians
(Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole
army was demanding.


During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been
the leader of all these movements--as the figurehead of a ship may
seem to a savage to guide the vessel--acted like a child who, holding a
couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.






CHAPTER XI


Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the
shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about
him.
 The French called it Azor; the soldier who
told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev and others called it Gray, or
sometimes Flabby.
 Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs
served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run
very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all
four.


Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by
Karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
a peasant coat and cap.
 Physically he had changed much during this
time.
 A beard and mustache
covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested
with lice, curled round his head like a cap.
 The look of his eyes
was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before.
"

In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
the air.

Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion
occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green
beside the fence.
.


Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told
him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
order about the prisoners that day.
 Sokolov, one of the soldiers in the
shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something
should be done about him.
"

(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre
and showed him all sorts of favors.
 'Monsieur Kiril is
a man of education, who speaks French.
.
 The other day if it had not been for you
that affair would have ended ill.
"

And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away.


A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,
which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
shirts for them.


Karataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,
was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot.
 His
hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,
and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.
 He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly.


The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising
his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.


"What does he want the bits for?" said Karataev.
"

And Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took
a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
Frenchman without looking at him.


"There, look at that," said Karataev, swaying his head.
 "People said
they were not Christians, but they too have souls.
 It did
not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or
Napoleon.
 His intention of killing Napoleon and his
calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now
seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous.
 What concern was it of his that somewhere or
other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter
to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that
their prisoner's name was Count Bezukhov?

He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite
agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew's thoughts somewhat
differently.
 The absence of suffering,
the satisfaction of one's needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
one's occupation, that is, of one's way of life, now seemed to Pierre to
be indubitably man's highest happiness.
 Here and now for the first time
he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of
warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
talk and to hear a human voice.
 The very
qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in
the world he had lived in--his strength, his disdain for the comforts of
life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity--here among these people
gave him almost the status of a hero.

His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly
at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned
regularly and quietly.


Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karataev had
made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest
and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and
squatted down beside him.


"I'll go and ask them again directly," said Pierre, rising and going to
the door of the shed.
 The corporal and
soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
straps, and these changed their familiar faces.
 Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
was suddenly heard from both sides.
.
 They looked at him and at his
shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien.
 What are you pushing for? Isn't the
road wide enough?" said he, turning to a man behind him who was not
pushing him at all.
.






CHAPTER XIV


Through the cross streets of the Khamovniki quarter the prisoners
marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they
came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
private vehicles.


When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men
crowded closer and closer together.
 Pierre stood
pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise
which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.


To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.


"What crowds! Just look at the crowds!.
.
 They've loaded goods even on
the cannon! Look there, those are furs!" they exclaimed.
.
 There! See what that one has behind
in the cart.
.
 Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by
heaven!.
.
.
 Look, look there.
.
.
.
 Behind them came more carts, soldiers,
wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,
more soldiers, and now and then women.


During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
had done at the start.
 They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing
scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of
their present situation.
 It grew light.
 The evening was ending, but the night had not yet
come.
 Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the
campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
common soldier prisoners were stationed.
 Suddenly he
burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that
men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
evidently solitary laughter could mean.
 They took me and shut me up.
 "And all that is me, all that is within me,
and it is all I!" thought Pierre.
 "And they caught all that and put it
into a shed boarded up with planks!" He smiled, and went and lay down to
sleep beside his companions.






CHAPTER XV


In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutuzov with a letter
from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though
Napoleon was already not far from Kutuzov on the old Kaluga road.

The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was
sent to Forminsk to attack Broussier.
 At the battle of Borodino, when Bagration was killed and nine
tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
this same irresolute and undiscerning Dokhturov--Kutuzov hastening to
rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.
 Many heroes have been described to
us in verse and prose, but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.
 The man who does not understand the construction of
the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and
not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.
 That same evening a house serf who had come from
Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town.


For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, who
was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering
a written report.
 Napoleon is at Forminsk,"
said Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.
 "My orders are to give it at
once to the general on duty.
) "I've
found it, I've found it!" he added.


"Oh, the nasty beasts!" said he with disgust.
 (Konovnitsyn did not stir.
 Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
boots.


"Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.
"

Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
importance and that no time must be lost.


Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn
frowned--partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at
the unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest
of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,
especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers
drawn with Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue
orders, and rescind them.


"They want to run to see how they have wounded it.


"And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to
them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies" (he
remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) "they have
foreseen everything.
 He
imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or
in sections--against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
 Kutuzov even imagined that Napoleon's army might turn back
through Medyn and Yukhnov, but the one thing he could not foresee was
what happened--the insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon's army
during its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made
possible what Kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of--the complete
extermination of the French.
 Dorokhov's report about Broussier's
division, the guerrillas' reports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors
of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
the French army was beaten and preparing for flight.


While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance
of the news.


"Tell me, tell me, friend," said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low, aged
voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,
"come nearer--nearer.
 I thank Thee, O
Lord!" and he wept.


Napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarutino
and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what would have
happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
provinces.


But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there
still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee.


That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does
not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which
influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk (that is,
the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him also.






CHAPTER XIX


A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion.
 And
the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.
 As with the physical law of gravity,
their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself.
 In their
hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.
 The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,
to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all
clamored for action.


Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the
case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.


And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,
trying to bar the road.


Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,
having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy's
army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and
subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all
the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the
statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or
decrease in the strength of the nation--even though it is unintelligible
why the defeat of an army--a hundredth part of a nation--should oblige
that whole nation to submit.


But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow.
 What
does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the
historians' usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);
if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event
occurred before our fathers' eyes, and for them it was a question of the
life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of
all known wars.


Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
according to all the rules of the art of fencing.


After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any
previous traditions of war.
 In spite of
the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather
disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit
thrust en prime, and so on--the cudgel of the people's war was lifted
with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting
anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and
fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French
till the whole invasion had perished.


People have called this kind of war "guerrilla warfare" and assume that
by so calling it they have explained its meaning.
 But such a war does
not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule
of tactics which is accepted as infallible.


This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers.
 Military
science says that the more troops the greater the strength.
 Men
who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
conditions for fighting.
 To define and express the significance of this
unknown factor--the spirit of an army--is a problem for science.
 Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and
therefore 4x = 15y.
 Consequently x/y = 15/4.
 The Russians, on the contrary, ought according
to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up
into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate
individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing
any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
dangers.


Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had
been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off
as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death.
 There were
also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and
landowners that remained unknown.


The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
October.
 To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing
him that he was already under the command of the German.
 On October 22 it was moving from
the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo.
 They reckoned
that the convoy had fifteen hundred men.
 All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
and to learn that he had to capture a "tongue"--that is, a man from
the enemy column.
 That morning's attack on the wagons had been made so
hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a
little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he
could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.
 His thin face with its short, thick
black beard looked angry.


Beside Denisov rode an esaul, * Denisov's fellow worker, also in felt
cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.



Esaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm
self-satisfaction in his face and bearing.


A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with an enormous
tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue
French overcoat.
 The horses,
being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.


On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
right, Denisov stopped.


"There are two, an officer and a Cossack.


"From the general," said the officer.


"There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, it's dangerous,'"
said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading
the dispatch.
 "But Komarov and I"--he pointed to the Cossack--"were
prepared.
 We have each of us two pistols.
.
.


"But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?" asked
Denisov.
 I think I could?" he returned, inquiringly.


"Well, all wight," said Denisov.


"Well, old fellow," said he to the peasant guide, "lead us to
Shamshevo.
"

Denisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the
hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the
edge of the forest.






CHAPTER V


The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
the trees.


Petya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now
at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and
along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.
.
.
"

While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded
from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then
another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices
shouting together came up from the slope.
 They were so near that they thought they were the cause
of the firing and shouting.


"So it is! It is!"

"The wascal!" said Denisov.


"What a beast!" said Denisov with his former look of vexation.
 "What has
he been doing all this time?"

"Who is he?" asked Petya.
'"

"Oh, yes," said Petya, nodding at the first words Denisov uttered as if
he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of
it.


Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.
 When Denisov had
come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,
the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village
elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them.
 Denisov had
Tikhon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words
in the elder's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and
the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.


"It won't hurt that devil--he's as strong as a horse!" they said of him.
.
 As if I don't know what
sort you want!"

"What a bwute you are!.
.
 Well?"

"I went for another one," Tikhon continued, "and I crept like this
through the wood and lay down.
" (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
with a supple movement to show how he had done it.
 He starts yelling, and suddenly there
were four of them.


"Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
puddles!" said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.
 He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to the esaul's
and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.
 "I wanted to question.
 But this uneasiness lasted only a moment.
 From the time he received his commission,
and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in
the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state of blissful
excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
miss any chance to do something really heroic.
 Before they had
ridden to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered he must carry
out his instructions strictly and return at once.
 In the passage of the small watchhouse a
Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton.
 Only do let me into the very.
.
.
 But I want.
.


"Only, please let me command something, so that I may really command.
.
.
.


And he handed him his clasp knife.
 I am used to something
sweet.
' I'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy.
.
 Perhaps.
.
"

"Yes, he's a poor little fellow," said Denisov, who evidently saw
nothing shameful in this reminder.
 His name is Vincent
Bosse.
 Have him fetched.
 A poor little fellow," Denisov repeated.
 He was awfully hungry!"

The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.


"Ah, c'est vous!" said Petya.
 "Entrez, entrez.
"


"Merci, monsieur," * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.


"Come in, come in!" he repeated in a gentle whisper.
 But
he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.






CHAPTER VIII


The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya's attention from the drummer boy,
to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had
dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
not sent away with the other prisoners.
 Denisov told him of the
designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message Petya
had brought, and his own replies to both generals.
 Then he told him all
he knew of the French detachment.
 But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,"
said Dolokhov.
 We can't start the
affair without knowing for certain how many there are.
"

"I, I.
 "Why shouldn't I go?"

"Because it's useless.
.
 You'll take me, won't you?" he said, turning to Dolokhov.
 Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or
thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining--I speak
bluntly--staining the honor of a soldier?"

"That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
sixteen," said Dolokhov with cold irony, "but it's time for you to drop
it.
"

"Why, I've not said anything! I only say that I'll certainly go with
you," said Petya shyly.
 The rest either starve or get killed.
 Only
not by my fault!"

Dolokhov began laughing.


"For you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them there
are.
 hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two
of us.
 "It will only make things worse.



    * "Who goes there?"


The blood rushed to Petya's face and he grasped his pistol.



    * "Lancers of the 6th Regiment.


"Mot d'ordre.


"Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
mot d'ordre.
.
"


And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
aside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.


Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov stopped
him and inquired where the commander and officers were.
 The man,
a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to
Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in
a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up
the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the
landowner's house.
 Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a
big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.


"He'll make them get a move on, those fellows!" said another, laughing.


Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of
Dolokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
horses.


"Is that you, Clement?" he asked.
 "Where the devil.


"If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late," said
a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.


He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
neck.
 Dolokhov, as if he had not heard the
question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took
from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
was safe from Cossacks.


"Will they bring our horses or not?" thought Petya, instinctively
drawing nearer to Dolokhov.
 Petya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or
not the French were running after them, but not daring to.
 At one spot he stopped and listened.
 Petya recognized the sound of Russian voices
and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.
 Tell Denisov, 'at the first shot at daybreak,'" said
Dolokhov and was about to ride away, but Petya seized hold of him.
 Dolokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and
vanished into the darkness.
"

"But.
.


Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.
 Behind
the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.

Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses
munching their oats.


"Why aren't you asleep, sir?" said a Cossack who was sitting under a
wagon.
.


"I say! Are the lads asleep?" asked Petya.
 He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.


"Why, this gentleman's saber.
 "Was the
cup left here?"

"There, by the wheel!"

The hussar took the cup.
 Perhaps it
was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who was sitting under the wagon, but it
might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the
world, whom no one knew of.
 It might really have been that the hussar
came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply
vanished--disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.


"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg.
 And what was played was
a fugue--though Petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.
 "It's in my ears.
 Well, go
on, my music! Now!.
.


"Now softly, softly die away!" and the sounds obeyed him.
 And
at first from afar he heard men's voices and then women's.
 Denisov stood by the
watchman's hut giving final orders.
 The infantry of the detachment
passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud.
 His face, having been bathed
in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.
 "Bwing the horses.
 Denisov was angry with the Cossack because the
saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted.
.
.
 Petya rode beside Denisov, the pulsation of his body constantly
increasing.
 Having reached the valley, Denisov looked back and
nodded to a Cossack beside him.


"The signal!" said he.


The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out.
 On the bridge
he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.
 Lads!.
 Cossacks, hussars, and ragged
Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,
were shouting something loudly and incoherently.
 "Too late again!" flashed through
Petya's mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
could be heard.

Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose
face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men.


"Wait?.
 The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after Petya into
the gateway of the courtyard.
 Petya was
galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved
both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther
to one side in his saddle.
 "We won't take them!" he
called out to Denisov.


Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and with
trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered
face which had already gone white.


"I am used to something sweet.
 Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone
on ahead.
 The artillery
the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was
now replaced by Marshal Junot's enormous baggage train, convoyed by
Westphalians.
 The symptoms of disorder that Pierre
had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now
reached the utmost limit.
 And the
escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,
of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness
and severity.
 He discovered that when he had married his wife--of his own free
will as it had seemed to him--he had been no more free than now
when they locked him up at night in a stable.
 However, he did not look at them now,
but thought of other things.
 The former and the latter were alike familiar
and his own.
 The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction
lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on
all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion.
 This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
conversation with Karataev the day before.


"How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won't grant us death," replied
Platon, and at once resumed the story he had begun.
 Karataev had told it
to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful
emotion.
 He was tried, knouted, and
his nostrils having been torn off, "all in due form" as Karataev put it,
he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.
 Well, one
night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among
them.
 And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they
had sinned against God.
 I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much
property.
 'I
don't grieve for myself,' he says, 'God, it seems, has chastened me.
 Well,
and what do you think, dear friends?" Karataev continued, his face
brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:
"What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the
authorities.
 The prisoners thronged together and were
pushed off the road.
 Several officers
formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them.


While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a
crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning.


Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
him.
 Pierre did not look round again
but went limping up the hill.

Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he
had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
Smolensk--a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by.
 "How is it I did not know
it before?"

"God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect
Him to the greatest extent.
 His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,
hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod.
 A prisoner, the Russian soldier the
Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something
with his hand.
 Still less
did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to
him.
 And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each
was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
himself.


At first while they were still moving along the Kaluga road, Napoleon's
armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the
Smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight--and
often thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.
 Besides, as a result of the frequent
and rapid change of position by each army, even what information was
obtained could not be delivered in time.


Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated
in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours.
 Seeing their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into
confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright, but then they
resumed their flight, abandoning their comrades who were farther behind.
 Their supreme chief donned a
fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,
abandoning his companions.
"

     * (2) That it is great.






CHAPTER XIX


What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign
of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,
dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is
that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry
and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)
the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and
capture them all?

How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the
French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve its purpose when it
had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture
them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had
surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could
that happen?

History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions
says that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov and Chichagov, and
this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers.
 But not even
that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
they who had suffered from the trampled beds.
 To cut
off an army--to bar its road--is quite impossible, for there is always
plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can
be seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
example of Krasnoe and of the Berezina.


The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been
done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame
because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should
do what was impossible.
 It could not exist because it was
senseless and unattainable.


The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion.


After Prince Andrew's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt this.
 To admit the possibility of
a future seemed to them to insult his memory.


Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything
that might lead up to the subject--this halting on all sides at the
boundary of what they might not mention--brought before their minds with
still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.
 She received letters from her relations to
which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put
was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych came to Yaroslavl with reports
on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvizhenka Street, which
had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs.


Natasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making
preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.
 As soon as anyone
entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and
picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the
intruder to go.


She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone--to the other side
of life.
 He then still wished to live and feared death.
 Had I said what I thought, I should have
said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,
I should have been happy compared with what I am now.
.
 nobody.
.
.


"Come to your Papa at once, please!" said she with a strange, excited
look.
 "A misfortune.
 about Peter Ilynich.
 All of
them--her father, mother, and Sonya--were so near to her, so familiar,
so commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to
the world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not
merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility.
 Petya.
.
 Go, go, she.


The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,
stretching out and beating her head against the wall.


"Natasha! Natasha!.
.
.
 He's lying.
.
 Mummy, my precious!.
 Won't you have some tea?"
Natasha went up to her.






CHAPTER III


Princess Mary postponed her departure.
 When the news of Petya's death had come she had been
a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room
a listless old woman taking no interest in life.
"

"No, no.
"

"She is much better.
 She spoke so well today," said Princess Mary.
 "Yes, like and yet not like.
 But she
is quite original, strange, new, and unknown.
"

And Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making
Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.
 When one went out the other became
restless and hastened to rejoin her.


Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already
in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning.
 For
Princess Mary, listening to Natasha's tales of childhood and early
youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
life: belief in life and its enjoyment.


She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer
of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate
young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so
cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that
it would soon no longer be seen or noticed.
 The only difference was that
the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction
as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind
in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their
own people.


Kutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
Tarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
army.

The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French.
 To that end Kutuzov's activity was
directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vilna--not casually or
intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.


Kutuzov felt and knew--not by reasoning or science but with the whole of
his Russian being--what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were
beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the
same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,
the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.



    * Knight without fear and without reproach.


But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole
time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
toward which he moved throughout the whole war.
 In reply to Lauriston's proposal of
peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people's will.
 He
alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are
useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
desire; that the enemy must be offered "a golden bridge"; that neither
the Tarutino, the Vyazma, nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that
we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would
not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.
 He alone during the whole retreat
insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,
and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia
crossed.


Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish, to
select him--an old man in disfavor--to be their representative in the
national war.


That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be cast
in the false mold of a European hero--the supposed ruler of men--that
history has invented.


The day was clear and frosty.
 Near Dobroe an immense
crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road
beside a long row of unharnessed French guns.


Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
saying.
 Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses
and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.


"What were you saying?" he asked the general, who continuing his report
directed the commander in chief's attention to some standards captured
from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment.


He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed deeply, and
closed his eyes.

Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident
reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head
and began to speak.


"I thank you all!" he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the
officers.


"Hur-r-rah!" roared thousands of voices.
 He ceased speaking and bowed
his head as if in perplexity.
 No one could have
repeated the field marshal's address, begun solemnly and then changing
into an old man's simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that
speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that
old man's good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay
in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and
long-sustained shouts.
 Afterwards when one of the generals addressed
Kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in
answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.
 All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
falling snow and toward evening it began to clear.
 The quartermasters who
met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff.


"Now then, all together--shove!" cried the voices, and the huge surface
of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen
swaying in the gloom of the night.
 Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
 Where are
you shoving to?"

"Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys.
.


"Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand.
.
.


"There, how that devil hits out! He's made my face all bloody," said he
in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.


Axes and choppers were plied all around.
 Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters
were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets
and accouterments put in order.






CHAPTER VIII


One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time--lacking warm boots
and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow
with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the
commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)--they would have
presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.
 The soldier
they called "Jackdaw," a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into
the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
carrying a load of wood.
.
.
.


"Look out, your soles will fly off!" shouted the red-haired man,
noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was hanging loose.


"They'll soon be issuing us new ones.
 They say that when we've finished
hammering them, we're to receive double kits!"

"And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all, it seems,"
said one sergeant major.


"Well, you know," said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a
squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
fire, "a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it's death.
 Take
me, now! I've got no strength left," he added, with sudden resolution
turning to the sergeant major.
 A queer lot!"

"But it's strange, friends," continued the man who had wondered at their
whiteness, "the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when they began
burying the dead--where the battle was you know--well, those dead had
been lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, 'they lie
as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder
smoke.
'"

"Was it from the cold?" asked someone.
 If it
had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either.
.
.
"

"And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,
my word, they didn't let us get near before they just threw down their
muskets and went on their knees.
 They say Platov took 'Poleon himself twice.
 But he didn't know the
right charm.
 He catches him and catches him--no good! He turns into
a bird in his hands and flies away.
 He won't come here again," remarked
the old soldier, yawning.


"Look at the stars.
 Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again
exchanging a few words.
 From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
of general, merry laughter.
.
 A huge
campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the
branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.
 Occasionally he emitted
a long-drawn groan and then again became silent.
 He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have
fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.


"Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are--a real peasant!"
came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.
" *


     * "Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy
     devil.
"

They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on
his third bowl.
.
.
"

They all grew silent.


The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the only possible
line of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the army
demanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up.
 When the bridges
broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with
children who were with the French transport, all--carried on by vis
inertiae--pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and
did not, surrender.
 But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same
pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
necessities of life.

Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective
flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.
 They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or
asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
every turn.


On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his "dear Vilna"
as he called it.


When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the
vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borisov
had been recovered and would be restored to him.
.


Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating
smile: "I meant merely to say what I said.


The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot,
frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the
old man, extended his arms and embraced him.


When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone's
voice saying:

"Your Serene Highness!"

Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
Count Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
a small object.
 When Kutuzov, conforming to a custom of Catherine's
day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
Emperor's feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face
and muttered something in which some people caught the words, "the old
comedian.


This being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally regarded
as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.


So naturally, simply, and gradually--just as he had come from Turkey to
the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army
when he was needed there--now when his part was played out, Kutuzov's
place was taken by a new and necessary performer.


It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the
impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months
and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper.
 He was surprised
to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external
conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external
liberty.
 "Oh, how good, how splendid!"

And by old habit he asked himself the question: "Well, and what then?
What am I going to do?" And he immediately gave himself the answer:
"Well, I shall live.
 That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
temporarily--he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
present itself again.
 And this very absence of an aim gave him the
complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
this time.
 He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
had looked for it.

To that question, "What for?" a simple answer was now always ready in
his soul: "Because there is a God, that God without whose will not one
hair falls from a man's head.
 The difference between his former and present self was that
formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to
him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
distinguish something at a distance.
 At present he still forgot what was
said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now
looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing
and hearing something quite different.
 Formerly he had appeared to be
a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid
him.
 Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and
sympathy for others, shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his
presence.


His servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticed the change
that had taken place in Pierre.


"Well, tell me.
.
 now, how did you get food?" he would ask.
 To Pierre as
he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that
he had been like that himself but a short time before.


Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,
his wife's affairs, and his official duties.
 He regarded all these
occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all
contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
family.
 This legitimate peculiarity of
each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a
basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other
people.
 Who needs it
most? And perhaps they are both impostors?" In the old days he had been
unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all
who asked as long as he had anything to give.


He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt
certain of what ought and what ought not to be done.
 A further proof to Pierre of his own
more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
with regard to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
and near Moscow.


During the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre had
experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his
journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
faces, that feeling was intensified.
 Other peasants, having heard of their comrades'
discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down
one another's prices to below what they had been in former days.
 They abused the police and bribed them,
made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
had perished in the fire, and demanded relief.






CHAPTER XV


At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of
his house which had not been burned.

Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and
everyone questioned him about what he had seen.
 The old footman, who met Pierre with a
stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,
informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that
she received on Sundays.
 He spoke of you even at the very
last," she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a
shyness that surprised him for an instant.


But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expressed still
greater embarrassment.


"But no, it can't be!" he thought.
 When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,
it was Natasha and he loved her.


Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's part,
but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.
 They
insisted on her coming with me.
 "You know it happened the very day we were rescued.

What a delightful boy he was!"

Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
widened and lit up.


"Why is it true?" Natasha asked, looking attentively into Pierre's eyes.
 "The thought alone of what
awaits.
.
 As he spoke now he was
considering what impression his words would make on Natasha.
.
?" Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
his whole body and eagerly listened to her story.
 "Yes, yes.

The faults he had--if he had any--were not of his making.
.
.
"

Natasha's voice broke.
 I did not dare to
ask about him.


"Well, that's all--everything," said Natasha.


She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door
which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed
from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.


Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.
 He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let
him go.
 They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk.
 The footmen drew back the
chairs and pushed them up again.
"

Natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
 Savelich says I must!"

"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you decided to
remain in Moscow?" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing
that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his
words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.
.
.
 Not only did I never see him but I heard
nothing about him--I was in much lower company!"

Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his
captivity was gradually led on to do so.
 The account Pierre gave of the incident
with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
this: "It was an awful sight--children abandoned, some in the flames.
"

"I am sure you're not telling us everything; I am sure you did
something.
"

And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last
days of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his death.


He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them.
 She saw the
possibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre, and the
first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.


Pierre finished his story.
 Pierre in shamefaced
and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what
to say next to introduce a fresh subject.


"People speak of misfortunes and sufferings," remarked Pierre, "but if
at this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be what you were before
you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?' then for
heaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine
that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is
only then that what is new and good begins.


"Yes, yes," she said, answering something quite different.


"What is it, Natasha?" said Princess Mary.


"Nothing, nothing.
" She smiled at Pierre through her tears.


"Well, good night, Mary!" said Natasha.
"

Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
Natasha's remark, but she did not express agreement in words.


"Is it possible to forget?" said she.


"It did me so much good to tell all about it today.
 "I am sure he really loved
him.
.
.
" Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, "he has
somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if he had just come out of
a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath.
 "He has greatly improved.


And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
if it had been forgotten there.


"Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything
that she and I may be man and wife," he told himself.
 What a good fellow he is and
how attentive, and how he remembers everything," he thought, looking at
Savelich's old face, "and what a pleasant smile he has!"

"Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?" Pierre
asked him.
 "Supposing I suddenly marry.


"No, I'll put it off for a bit.
 I'll tell you later.
 "No,
another time.
"

"No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?"

"I heard about that affair of hers at the time.


"How kind they all are," thought Pierre.
 "What is surprising is that
they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
interest to them.


She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince
Andrew's fiancee.
 A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on
her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.


Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but
Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.
 Pierre noticed this but could not go.


"No, I am not going," Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as
though offended.
.
.


"Yes, I wanted to tell you," said he, answering her look as if she had
spoken.
 I know I am not worthy of her, I
know it's impossible to speak of it now.

"I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her
alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without
her.
.
.
.
.
 Tell me, can I hope?
Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!" he added after a pause, and
touched her hand as she did not reply.
"

Pierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes.
.
.
 "Write to her
parents, and leave it to me.
 I will tell her when I can.
"

"No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can't be.
.
 How happy I am!
No, it can't be!" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary's hands.
 "Is it possible?
No, it can't be," he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that
filled his soul with joy.
"

"Good-by, Count," she said aloud.
'"

That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre.
 At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
one thing only--his future happiness.
 He often
surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them.
.


Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.

To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
surface and demanded satisfaction.
 She spoke little of Pierre, but when
Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled
in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.
 "Can she have loved
my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?" she thought
when she reflected on the change.
 But when she was with Natasha she was
not vexed with her and did not reproach her.
 The reawakened power
of life that had seized Natasha was so evidently irrepressible and
unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had
no right to reproach her even in her heart.


 Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling
that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but
bright and cheerful.
 Tell me.
.
"

"You love him?"

"Yes," whispered Natasha.
 Let us talk about you.
"





FIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20





CHAPTER I


Seven years had passed.
 They now seemed
to rotate on one spot.


According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia
also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according
to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
of his reign, being the savior of Russia.


There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to
learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for
things he did wrong at this period of his reign.

He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
disbanding the Semenov regiment.

This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching
the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new
writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa.


But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander
could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance
from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to the
program his present accusers would have given him--of nationality,
freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground).


If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of
life is destroyed.






CHAPTER II


If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
attainment of certain ends--the greatness of Russia or of France,
the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the
Revolution, general progress, or anything else--then it is impossible
to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
chance and genius.


But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only
admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,
and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened
to the ram that was fattened.


Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of
historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
(incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words
chance and genius become superfluous.






CHAPTER III


The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the
beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.
 Innumerable so called chances
accompany him everywhere.
 The disfavor into which he falls with the
rulers of France turns to his advantage.


On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process
of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped
out and destroyed.
 Again so-called chance accompanies him.


He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from
his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his
mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
the conspiracy is crowned with success.
 In alarm he wishes to
flee, considering himself lost.
 Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly
causes him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than
in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.
 There is no step, no crime or petty fraud
he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
represented as a great deed.
 The most suitable fete the Germans can
devise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerstadt.
 Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
reason and to prepare him for his terrible part.
 But
suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had
so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur--from
the cold in his head at Borodino to the sparks which set Moscow on
fire, and the frosts--and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable
baseness become evident.


The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now
not for Napoleon but always against him.


A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
 Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his
actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance
occurs.






CHAPTER IV


The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels.
 It rises again from the same
point as before--Paris.


The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any
conspiracy and without soldiers.
 The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.


And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself
in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole
world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
unseen hand directed his actions.
 And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been
prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.
 After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all
possible power.
 How does he use it?

Alexander I--the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years
had striven only for his people's welfare, the originator of the liberal
innovations in his fatherland--now that he seemed to possess the utmost
power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
welfare of his peoples--at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing
up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
had he retained power--Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and
feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance
of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands
of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:

"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!.
 I too am a man like the
rest of you.
"

As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and
yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.


A bee settling on a flower has stung a child.
 A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from
flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.
 And so it is with the purpose of historic
characters and nations.






CHAPTER V


Natasha's wedding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was the last
happy event in the family of the old Rostovs.
 A few days later he fell ill and took to his
bed.
.
.


Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his
father's death reached him.
 He at once resigned his commission, and
without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
Moscow.
 The state of the count's affairs became quite obvious a month
after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small
debts the existence of which no one had suspected.
 But
he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father's memory, which he
held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.
 Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his
brother-in-law Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due
for value received.


Sonya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her
whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty
from the old countess.
 He felt
that the more he valued her the less he loved her.
 He had taken her at
her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
any case be renewed.
 The idea of putting something
aside out of his salary proved a dream.
 He could see no way out of this situation.


"I never expected anything else of him," said Princess Mary to herself,
feeling a joyous sense of her love for him.


When the princess came out of the countess' room Nicholas met her again,
and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.


"Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can't bear these
ladies and all these civilities!" said he aloud in Sonya's presence,
evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess' carriage
had disappeared.


She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed
a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she
began to talk about her.
"

"You used to want to, and now you don't.
 Really I don't understand you,
my dear.
"

"But I never said I was dull.
 She is a very
admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you
have got some notion or other in your head.
 You hide everything from
me.
"

"Not at all, Mamma.
 One would think mere politeness required it.
.
"

"It doesn't matter to me.
 I only wish it for your sake.
"

Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
patience, trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic.


Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then
again looked at the princess.


She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.


"Yes, yes," said she, "but you have no reason to regret the past, Count.

As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it
with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now.
.


"I thought you would allow me to tell you this," she said.
 "I don't know why," she continued, recovering herself,
"but you used to be different, and.
"

"There are a thousand reasons why," laying special emphasis on the why.
 "Sometimes it is hard.
 You must tell me!"

He was silent.


"I don't understand your why, Count," she continued, "but it's hard for
me.
 "I have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
for me to bear.
.
.


"Princess, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.

"Princess!"

She turned round.






CHAPTER VII


In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald
Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sonya.


Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it
that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation.
 He always had before his
mind's eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it.
 The
chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen
in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important
agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made
effective--the peasant laborer.
 He kept the
peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing
the family groups to divide into separate households.


He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay
and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown
and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did
Nicholas.
 He knew that his
every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.


He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to
make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined
to do so.
 She did not understand why he spoke
with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and
well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who with his family had carted
corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') sheaves were already
stacked before anyone else had his harvest in.
 I must
put our affairs in order while I am alive, that's all.
 That's all about it!" said he,
clenching his vigorous fist.
 "He was a
master.
.
 the peasants' affairs first and then his own.


Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a
man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of
dishonesty and various irregularities.
 On returning to lunch Nicholas
went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
morning.
 Countess
Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and
lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.
.
.
.


Nicholas said nothing.
 He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up
and down the room.

Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
had long been sinning against himself.
 Never," he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
asking for forgiveness.


The tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes.


"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?" she asked to change the
subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
Laocoon's head.
 "I deserve it.

He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and
consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid.
 The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he
spent a certain sum every year.
 She thoroughly realized the wrong he
had done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her
wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice.
 She is a sterile
flower, you know--like some strawberry blossoms.
 Sometimes I am sorry
for her, and sometimes I think she doesn't feel it as you or I would.
"

Though Countess Mary told Natasha that those words in the Gospel must be
understood differently, yet looking at Sonya she agreed with Natasha's
explanation.
 Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the
home.
 The house was spacious
and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors.
 Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three
weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
expected back every minute.
 He examined the bailiff's accounts of
the village in Ryazan which belonged to his wife's nephew, wrote two
business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and
stables before dinner.

Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in
a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
ill-humor.
 But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy.
 She asked
him where he had been.
 Her unnatural tone made him wince
unpleasantly and he replied hastily.
 She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but
could not refrain from asking some more questions.
"

Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sonya and the
old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,
could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their
moments of antagonism.
"

And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
lay down on the sofa.
 I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I
am in this condition.


The children were playing at "going to Moscow" in a carriage made of
chairs and invited her to go with them.
 She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
difficulty, went to the small sitting room.


"Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired," said Sonya, meeting
her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she
crossed her path everywhere).
"

Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that
Sonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident
difficulty refrained from saying something harsh.
.
.
 Countess Mary moved away from the
door and took the boy back to the nursery.


She went in and sat down by her husband.


"I did not notice him following me," she said timidly.


Natasha smiled bashfully.


"Again!" she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
where Nicholas had placed the kiss.


"I don't know why you think I am cross," said Nicholas, replying to the
question he knew was in his wife's mind.
 It is only Malvinas and women of that kind who are
loved for their beauty.
.
 So you're not angry with
me?"

"Awfully angry!" he said, smiling and getting up.


"Do you know, Mary, what I've been thinking?" he began, immediately
thinking aloud in his wife's presence now that they had made it up.


Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in
her turn began thinking aloud.
 You are too fond of this one," his wife
whispered in French.
.


In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
gallop round the room.


Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
 In her face there was none of the ever-glowing
animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.
 The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now.
 The young Countess Bezukhova was not often seen
in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her
and found her neither attractive nor amiable.


And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole
soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger
did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.


If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two
dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.

A husband was given her and he gave her a family.
 And she not only saw
no need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her
soul were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not
imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
different.
 From the very first days of their married life Natasha had
announced her demands.
 Their way of
life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natasha's
occupations, the children's upbringing, were all selected not merely
with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what Natasha from the
thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be.
 When Pierre himself wanted to
change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.
 When her next baby was born, despite
the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband
himself--who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby
herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious--she insisted
on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.


After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm
consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw
himself reflected in his wife.
 To Pierre's timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.

He was given four weeks' leave of absence.
 A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about
the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.


Cautiously withdrawing her breast, Natasha rocked him a little, handed
him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door.
 A flood of
brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.
.
.
.
.
.
"

Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he
knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;
above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy.
 And they went to
their rooms.
 A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby's broad face
with its toothless open mouth.


"And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?" she
asked.
 You've seen the princess? Is it true she's in love with
that.
.
"

"Yes, just fancy.
"

At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in.
 Pierre, however, he adored.
 So the boy also was happy that Pierre had
arrived.
 If he now incurred
Natasha's censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
things.
 To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which
to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now
added stinginess.


Natasha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
showed her.
"

And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
the old countess' rooms.


The countess was sitting with her companion Belova, playing
grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Natasha came into the drawing
room with parcels under their arms.
 When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health
would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the
pretext would be Countess Mary.
 When her vocal organs needed exercise,
which was usually toward seven o'clock when she had had an after-dinner
rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same
stories over and over again to the same audience.


But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had
played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,
that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to
her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied.


Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the
little children failed to understand this and avoided her.
 "But best of all you have brought yourself back--for I never saw
anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we
to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away.
 At tea all sat
in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table
where his tea was handed to him; Milka, the old gray borzoi bitch
(daughter of the first Milka), with a quite gray face and large black
eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside
him; Denisov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half
gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general's tunic unbuttoned;
Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess.
 He spoke of what he
knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand.
 Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of
these things, but Nicholas and Natasha always brought him back to the
health of Prince Ivan and Countess Mary Alexeevna.
"

"Well, you know, Maman," Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate
things into his mother's language, "Prince Alexander Golitsyn has
founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.
 I used to meet him at Mary Antonovna's," said the countess in an
offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,
she went on: "Nowadays everyone finds fault.


"Finished, finished!" little Natasha's gleeful yell rose above them all.


Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natasha he
never lost sight of) and smiled happily.


"Oh, I'll go and see," said Pierre, jumping up.
"

Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still
louder.


"Come, Anna Makarovna," Pierre's voice was heard saying, "come here into
the middle of the room and at the word of command, 'One, two,' and when
I say 'three'.
.
.






CHAPTER XIV


Soon after this the children came in to say good night.
 Countess Mary
glanced at him and turned to Pierre.


"When you are here he can't tear himself away," she said.
 Good night!"
said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young
Nicholas with a smile.


Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
children had interrupted.
 Oh, they
should let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose--he'd knock all this nonsense
out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semenov wegiment to a
fellow like that Schwa'tz!" he cried.
 The questions put by these two kept the
conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
higher government circles.
 Countess Mary
followed her.


"Why this," began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: "the position
in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything.



    * Without faith or law.
 Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it
is a society of true conservatives--a society of gentlemen in the full
meaning of that word.
 We join hands only for the public welfare and the
general safety.
.
 It was not what he was saying that pleased her--that did not
even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she
knew that it sprang from Pierre's whole soul), but it was his animated
and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.
 If we're
not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own.
 Je suis
vot'e homme!" *


    * "I'm your man.
.
 He flushed and went up to Nicholas.
.
 She was afraid that what she was writing would
not be understood or approved by her husband.
 I tried threats, but he only grew angrier.

It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.
 One can do anything with him by
tenderness.
"

Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
continued to turn over the pages and read.
 In the diary was set down
everything in the children's lives that seemed noteworthy to their
mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
on educational methods.


He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own
insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the
more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
himself.
 But he is impossible: such a child! I don't know what would
become of him if Natasha didn't keep him in hand.
.
.
.
 Of course he is right there," said
Countess Mary, "but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,
duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose
ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.
 "But they insisted on their own view:
love of one's neighbor and Christianity--and all this in the presence of
young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.
 He is constantly alone with his thoughts.


"Still, I am not the same as his own mother," said Countess Mary.
 She only
took his hand and kissed it.
 He took this as a sign of approval and
a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutes' reflection
continued to think aloud.
 Countess Mary's soul always
strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could
therefore never be at peace.


"I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies," he said.
 "How she understands children! It is as
if she saw straight into their souls.
.
.
.
 "Which was most delighted? Lisa, I'm sure.
"

"Yes," Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind.
 Besides, when I was in
Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go
to pieces without me--everyone was pulling his own way.

What I say is: 'Join hands, you who love the right, and let there be but
one banner--that of active virtue.
 Judging by what he had said there was no one
he had respected so highly as Platon Karataev.
.
 He was always so anxious
to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should
have been proud to let him see us.
.
"

"Yes, I should think.
.


"No, it's not that.
.
.
.
.
"

They were silent for a few seconds.
 Pierre began with
self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha with a quiet, happy smile.

Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
continue.
 It was the sequel to his complacent
reflections on his success in Petersburg.
 My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same.

Well, good-by!" and she left the room.
 He had awaked from a terrible dream.
 And Uncle Nicholas stood before
them in a stern and threatening attitude.
 But someday I shall have
finished learning, and then I will do something.
 I will do better.


The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
and seize the apparently elusive--the life of a people.
 But modern history has not done this.
 Several times it moves
eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.


During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left
untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions
of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions
of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
another.


Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what
this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these
events? Then listen:

"Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such
mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly.
 His
descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly.
 And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and
killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him.
 In Russia there
was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and
therefore fought against Napoleon.
 Helena.






CHAPTER II


What force moves the nations?

Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers.


According to this view the power of historical personages, represented
as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
as a force that itself produces events.
 The ideas of the Revolution and the
general temper of the age produced Napoleon's power.
 But Napoleon's
power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of
the age.


This curious contradiction is not accidental.
 This condition is never
observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant
forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient
components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.
 But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this
opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of
1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside
Alexander's will--such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame
de Stael, Talleyrand, Fichte Chateaubriand, and others.
 The historian
evidently decomposes Alexander's power into the components: Talleyrand,
Chateaubriand, and the rest--but the sum of the components, that is,
the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the
others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon
of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons.
 And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
the submission of millions of people resulted--that is, how component
forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A--the
historian is again obliged to fall back on power--the force he had
denied--and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he
has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant.
 They see it in what is
called culture--in mental activity.






CHAPTER III


A locomotive is moving.
 Someone asks: "What moves it?" A peasant says
the devil moves it.
 He has devised a complete explanation.


Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
observed.

You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and
such histories as Thiers' will be interesting and instructive and may
perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry.


The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
of gold.


This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
him by God.


Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or
tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.

Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
contradictory can only satisfy young children.


Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation's
progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,
or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country.
 And so these historians also see
and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.


These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some
plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all
that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the
mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer
resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.
 And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade--the deliverance
of Jerusalem--had been clearly defined by historic leaders.


Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
life of the peoples.






CHAPTER V


The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for
the connection between those men and the nations has not been found.


"The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
leader.
" Such is the reply historians
who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to
rulers under conditions which they regard as known.


The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
persons is merely a paraphrase--a restatement of the question in other
words.
 What is power? Power is the
collective will of the people transferred to one person.
 Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the
Bourbons.
 On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the
cause of events, history shows that the expression of the will of
historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that
is to say, their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very
opposite of what they order occurs.
 But
speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of
commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that
takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection
between the person commanding and those who execute his command.


No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.


When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
commands dependent one on another.
 Today he ordered such and such
papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;
tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the
commissariat, and so on and so on--millions of commands, which formed
a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
French armies into Russia.
 This relation consists in the following:

For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which
regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the
relation between those taking part in it is always the same.


Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the
smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which
they have combined.
 An
officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more
frequently.
 When one of the opinions expressed
is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
preceding it.


When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present
activity, and guide him in planning his future actions.


For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill
one another.
 But these
justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.
 These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear
men's moral responsibilities from their path.
 How
is it that millions of men commit collective crimes--make war, commit
murder, and so on?

With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe
can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,
ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any
collective action which cannot find its justification in political
unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So
that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of
the will of one man or of several men.
 But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
anticipating its movement.


Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
and decreed.


Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically
it is those who submit to the power.


In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity--that final limit
to which in every domain of thought man's reason arrives if it is not
playing with the subject.


Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we
cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is
inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law.
 The
same applies to historical events.
 But the law of history relates to man.


All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
question.


If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that
is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man's
in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.
 But regarding him from within ourselves as what
we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.


This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and
independent of reason.


To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be
conscious of himself as living.
 But his will--which forms the essence of his life--man
recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.


You say: I am not free.
 But the same series of experiments
and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends
on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet
man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.


However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment
that he can act as he pleases.
 Every man, savage or sage, however
incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which
constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life.
 He feels
that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception
of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would
be unable to live for a single moment.


He could not live, because all man's efforts, all his impulses to life,
are only efforts to increase freedom.
 Wealth and poverty, fame and
obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and
disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,
virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.


Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.
 In our
time the majority of so-called advanced people--that is, the crowd of
ignoramuses--have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one
side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.
 They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination
of one side of it.


In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as
experimental science stands to abstract science.


Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual
we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man's free
will and partly of the law of inevitability.


A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother
exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained
to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless
man--seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of
necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,
and so on.
 This is what makes it
evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man
closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one
bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free
and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
seclusion.


If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around
him, each action of his seems to us free.
 But if we see his relation
to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything
whatever--with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on
which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that
falls on the things about him--we see that each of these circumstances
has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.


If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same
circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly
free.
 If I reflect on an action still
more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action
are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have
happened had that action not been performed.
 The
farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more
doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
the more manifest the law of inevitability.
 In the case of a crime we most urgently
demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we
rate its merit most highly.


So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
external world is well known, where the time between the action and
its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most
accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
minimum of free will.


(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom
in space.
 Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
him and by his own body.
 However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
expression of will in any action, our own or another's, the first demand
of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a
cause no phenomenon is conceivable.


(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while
time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
inevitability.


(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we
shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we
never reach absolute inevitability.
 And
so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
the conception of a man's completely free action.


But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but
felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we
know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first
knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton's law), so too the
force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,
up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).
 The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical
affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
differently defined by reason.


The recognition of man's free will as something capable of influencing
historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for
history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
would be for astronomy.
 Arriving at
infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the
process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration
of unknown, infinitely small, quantities.
 When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all
bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the
movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies
from the infinitely large to the infinitely small.


By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
studying historic events as the results of man's free will.


The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
fought out in physical philosophy.
 To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to
Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
religion.


As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth's fixity and of
the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing
the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause
lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one's own
personality.
