 beck-s	 We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names  and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me  how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp  and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).   Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore,  they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001,  which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call.   Thanx.

beck-s	 Julie,  Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel. Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

We have a couple more that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their final decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that you guys could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and thus thought it may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron (doing it at the Hyatt is an  option as well but the room might be on the large? side)? We would  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We can teach both days as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.  I just wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know? where we stand on final  numbers by next  Wednesday.  Julie

FASB 133 FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting=20 Standards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the=20 requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote again= st=20 the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility= ,=20 and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a= =20 summary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during= =20 May 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If= =20 you, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please= =20 contact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy=20 Suppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.

The bill would repeal PUHCA an= d=20 transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities= =20 and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and=20 appropriate state agencies. S.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY),= =20 the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition= =20 Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for=20 electric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of=20 representatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade=20 Commission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of=20 Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also= =20 contained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen.

Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine=20 original co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.  HR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-fre= e=20 sale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear= =20 decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing=20 deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking,= =20 3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections = to=20 transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use= =20 tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distributio= n=20 facilities.  The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has= =20 urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will= =20 help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute= =20 noted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energ= y=20 Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and=20 stand-alone legislation could also be introduced.

I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on  meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in  an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their  gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review  to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement  methodology for the London office.  In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards  across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment  for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and  other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.  I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so  that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those  control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not  operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to  develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:  - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash  collections are timely)  - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its  maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date  with            exceptions noted)  - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard  (i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)  - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each  measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)  I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control  functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of  work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time  requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to  be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a  high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but  it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.  As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for  each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk  associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and  power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know  if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward  to seeing you next week.   
beck-s	 Here is a revised summary of the 13 candidates I sent to Tony Vasut.  I  believe he has made initial contact with each of them.  If you decide you  would like to talk to them, please don't mention my name, as some of them are  former clients of mine, used to work with me, or still work with my husband  (I think you get the picture - I've been gone from PwC less than a month).   However, I would be pleased to talk to you about any of the people mentioned  below.  I have categorized them into 5 categories - senior level, IT/Risk, mid level,  junior level, and admin assistants.  I have not spoken to the majority of  these people about giving our recruiting department their name (see note  above), with the exception of Mark Smith, Dave Simpson, and Connie Shugart.   All of these people have indicated great interest in coming to Enron.  Again, please call me with any questions, or need of further info.  My  extension is 39123.  Best regards  Shona  Senior level risk people  Andy Dunn until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.  Due  to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left  the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit  personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  I have worked  with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to Enron.   The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot,  but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in  leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040.  Mark (Allan) Smith Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.  We worked  very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva  trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had  many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked  in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).   Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are extremely impressed with his  knowledge and background.  I would highly recommend him for a leadership role  at Enron.  I spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at  Enron.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  His cell phone number is 713 412  3890.    IT/Risk people   Shawn lafferty, Alan Beaton, & Carolyn Johnson These people are all senior managers in KPMG's Information risk management  department and are all looking for opportunities outside KPMG.  They all have  8+ years work experience in the IT field.  KPMG's main number is 713 319 2000.   Mid level risk people   Marilyn Chee  She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for  derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and all mtm  accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all  products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.   She was my main contact at Equiva when I was their auditor.  She is extremely  diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have  to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a  client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at  the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year  as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to  me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase,  and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that  she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713  277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it  due to the PwC/alliance relationship.  Scott Barnes Scott is an audit manager at PwC.  He has worked in energy for his career,  which he spent in Houston and Moscow and New York.  He has worked as an audit  manager, a special projects manager for the managing partner of the Houston  office, a manager in the capital markets group (the group responsible for  helping non-US companies prepare to register and list with the SEC), and the  transaction support group (the group that is resposnible for performing due  diligence procedures for PwC clients).  He is looking for opportunities  outside PwC.  The PwC general line is 713 356 4000.  Keith Considine He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best senior PwC  Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked  with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of work experience  (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked for me on the  Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both  myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any  of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working on a project at one  of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .  He definitely  does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently  planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.  I actually  recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to  capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. His  number is 713 356 5617.   Junior level risk people  Robin Manspeaker  currently works as a scheduler at Equiva Trading.  She has been there about a  year and a half.  Before that, she worked at Novarco in White Plains (a  subsidiary of Marc Rich).  She was there about 3 years.  I do not know where  she was before that.  I have worked with her during my audits of Marc Rich.   She seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes  surrounding it. I do not have her number, but you can call Shell information  at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you.  Dave Simpson Analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work  experience of about 2 years.  He is very interested in leaving Koch.  I know  him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a good guy and  very likeable.  His phone number is 713 544 7649  Robert Hernandez is someone who may be able to fill an open position at Enron South America.   Last year, Robert worked for me at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the  external audit of Coral Energy.  He was a great worker and very good at his  job.  He speaks fluent Spanish as well as fluent English.  Before working at PwC, Robert worked in the gas trading industry in the  mid/back office.  I'm not sure of all of his responsibilities, but I do know  he was involved in gas actualizations. In total, I think he has about 4 years  of work experience.  He left PwC in March to take a position with Heins in their internal audit  department.  I have not spoken to him since he left, but do know he paid a  recruiter to find him this position.  I do not know if he is happy at his  current company or not.  I do not know his number, but he can surely be found by using the general  line.  I looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494, 713 225  0565.   Admin assistants   Connie Shugart she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.  She is also  involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal  audit service lines.  She is very interested in Enron and has asked me a few  times to get her a contact here.  I have not worked directly with her but due  to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was  very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).  I have spoken to her  about giving her name to Tony and she is very excited about coming over and  interviewing.  She really wants to work for Enron!  Ellen Robertson She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have  never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she  should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

beck-s	 This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for  trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many  people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide  some feedback.  I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We  can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process". In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is  submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final  (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to  the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the  final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)  I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via  EnronOnline.com. -Chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on  04/24/2001 07:48 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 04/24/2001 07:40 PM To: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Harkness/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James  Ginty/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Fallon/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Kimberly/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Howard/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications,  Kristin Albrecht/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristina  Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin  Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Paul Racicot/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Zachary McCarroll/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: calculating bid-ask prices   I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to  forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market,  we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some  positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the  studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the  price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange  system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading  period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post  "tentative" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their  acceptable buying or selling price. These "tentative" bid-ask prices get  updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw  their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we  calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower  selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer  who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask  price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a  broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those  bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and  insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market  be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual  gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers  with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the  mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can  reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the "mark-to-market"  charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the  gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way  as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the  couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined  from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price  should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee

beck-s	 FYI  - Exotic Library :   Issue :  The London version is different from the Houston version.   The problem is that some bugs in the London version were found.  Temporary solution: Bugs were immediately fixed at a local level.  Permanent Solution:  The London Exotic Version will be replaced by the  Houston Exotic Version.    The Houston Version is expected to be robust.     Sharad (London Research) is spending this coming week in Houston.     When Sharad is back to London, the Houston version will replace the London  version.  Approach:  Steven Leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that  will involve IT to fully test the similarity of the two versions.   The procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement.   Hopefully, no discrepancies will be found.   In the adverse case it happens, it will be necessary to conduct an analysis  to decide what is wrong.   If necessary  further testing and development has to take place.  Rodrigo

beck-s	 Pat,  I have been working with Volume Management, Settlements, Vance, and Bob to  clean up some prior period and prior-to-current month issues.  This process  should result in a correction to booked profit/loss for Vance and the desk.   This has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties  manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered.  I would propose  that Logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually  cut.  It would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by  counterparty, meter, and/or deal ticket id or price.  I feel that this will  allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively.  Please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.    Thank you for your time,  Mary  ext 35251 
beck-s	 Executive Summary Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term. New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the  utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities' hydro assets in  exchange for rate increases. Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be  between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour. Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&E's  utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding  company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock. State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible  bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both        companies. Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue  solutions or "bail out".  Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.   The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as  well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed  5.5 cents was "a fantasy" and impossible to obtain.   Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred  Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edision's hydroelectric  facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the  utilities out of  bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases,  however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this  month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from  consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state  would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the  bill, the state of California would control 10% of all California's  electricity.  As you  can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According  to recent corporate filings, PG&E's hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.   Davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full  $12 billion should  be covered.   On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling, though few  agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity  providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday  night they would come down to "less than eight cents" or less than half of  what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term  contracts.  Because  consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  PUC rules, any hope California has to "work off" the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to Davis' price cap, without falling back on  higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly  important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on  Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.  Utility's Audit By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings  about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A   source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years, PG&E's utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the  holding  company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock.   Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the  direction of  Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.  Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high.    California's political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two  utilities. The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:  1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy?  Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edison's finances were so  bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.   Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos. 2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of  electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge. 3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity,  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages. 4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier   (one of the reasons why suppliers won't sell electricity on credit to these  companies now). 5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process. 6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think. This is particularly true if this week's audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments.  Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his  job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis  concern's is, according to a senior official in the Governor's office, that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti-utility and  anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a  senior official, "No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action is at least as large now as then."  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say,  "The  anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldn't do anything about it."  This threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a  guarantee  for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure,  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next  several years.

beck-s	  As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale  Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services  Legal Department.   The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the  legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed  the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve  greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.   To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will  include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor,  Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron  Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.   The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More  comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.  Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke   
beck-s	 Folks,  I have been a bit quiet here since reaching India, primarily because of the  delay in the arrival of the Henwood team from Australia.  They are finally arriving on Sunday, and Krishna is joining me in Mumbai on  Sunday evening itself.  I would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data  and the type fo questions that you all would like to ask.  Stinson - Could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all  to hae a confernce call, but not earlier than Monday evening, India time  (Monday morning Houston time).  Please jot me a note on what would be a good  time for the call.  I will work out an agenda for the call.  Primarily, it will be discussion of  the data and on what runs we should do to begin with.  Another key part of this will be the Rate Case that MSEB is filing, because  this will determine what wil be MSEB's paymet capability in 2001/02.  This is  critical for us.  We have our in-house expert who has been working on this  for some time now, and he will also present some of the material on that call.  Regards, Sandeep.  PS::  I am forwarding the basic data that Henwood has sent to the whole team  so that you have an opportunity to look at it, if you havent already got it. 
beck-s	 Dale,  My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London. We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate  this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around  him any longer.  I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.  We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in  practically every location where we operate.  A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false  security for both an employee and the company.  I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc  you. I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.  Vince       Dale Surbey 07/11/2000 10:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Steve Leppard  Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.  I'd value your thoughts on this.  Thanks,  Dale   
beck-s	 Jim,  CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a production tool.  We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has) in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later this week.   I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can consider it as commercial product.  Vince       James L Bouillion 04/11/2001 06:52 AM To:

In order to weed out the origination offices from trading  offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were  unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.  1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) Enron  people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire  (Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of a  trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on  Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as  Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).  2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to  get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order for  you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whether  their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed  (or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy,  Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the  audit report for MGL & MGMCC audit is due to start on tuesday.  3.  Once we have clarified the extent of AAs work we will assess what else  needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to  complete the reviews.  Many thanks  Naomi

beck-s	 Daren,  I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close  week for Volume Management.  98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30  decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate  2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000  production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I  see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the  ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled  differently.    98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K  applied.

Dr. Kaminski:  I am a Ph.D. student here at Carnegie Mellon who has a long-standing interest in the energy industry.  I have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity prices that I would like your opinion on. Could you please chalk out some time for me during your CMU visit this Friday?  Unlike traditional electricty pricing models, which assume that the log-price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors, I assume that some fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors. Next, given the current values of these factors, price is determined by economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity generators. Unlike typical factor models, the factors in my model are potentially observable.   Thank You,     Aziz A.

beck-s	 Summary:    Late night efforts by the California assembly to craft a legislative solution  are falling short of market and creditor expectations.  Bankruptcy appears  increasingly likely, but the dynamics of a Ch.11 proceeding remain unclear.  SoCal Edison is likely to be the first in Ch.11 following its suspended  payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period.  Attempts  to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed.   Bankruptcy would provide Davis with some political cover to implement the  tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and  other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the  California Power Authority.  1. Legislation Passes Assembly, But Generators and Consumers Remain Unhappy  The first legislation (AB 1X)  passed the California general assembly last  night, but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms.   Generators object to the 5.5 cent per KW/H price in the proposed long-term  contract, while consumer groups such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power.  The  legislation is expected to pass the Senate today and to be signed by Governor  Davis as early as tonight.  Press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial  creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill, which is  viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the  financial pressures on the utilities.  2. Financial Institutions Exposure to California Utilities  Bank of America: $215 million J.P. Morgan: $202 million  There is a total of $12 billion in outstanding loans, but much of this  (arranged by Societe General) is to the parents National Energy Group and  Edison International.  The $417 million mentioned above is the most immediate  concern.  The Southern California Edison loans are subject to immediate  repayment in the aftermath of yesterday's rating downgrade to junk status.  The Fed will not be involved, except in a routine way as a bank regulator  making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the  utilities' loans and securities. There is no moral hazard here, because the  Fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities' credits, which, by the  way, they do not have the authority to do.   3. PG&E/National Energy Group- Shielding Assets  Despite considerable anger at  PG&E for reorganizing to shield its profitable  assets from its debt-plagued utility business, it would seem that Davis has  little authority to intervene. The question of "fraudulent conveyance", which  is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not  long before a filing (which transfer can then be reversed by the court) would  not seem to apply here, since PG&E went through a regulatory process before  FERC to seek approval for the reorganization on Friday.  While courts are  reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies, impaired creditors in a bankruptcy  proceeding could attempt an appeal.  4. Involuntary Bankruptcy- Which Creditor Moves First?  As for who is likely to move first, it is typically the smaller creditors or  those who won't receive a good price on post-petition business. In this  situation our source does not know who that would be, but believes it is more  likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their  major creditors files an involuntary petition.  If Dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today, the debtor  utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to, particularly  since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of  assets.  In bankruptcy proceedings (which is what is going on here), this  sort of talk by a creditor such as Dynegy is just the usual "polite  conversational opener," akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about  one's family's health.   5. Edison Teetering on the Brink- Moves Into 30 Day Cure Period  Yesterday, Southern California Edison temporarily suspended a $230 million  bond principal and interest payments as well as $151 million to suppliers of  renewable power and $215 million due to the California PX.  Both utilities  are under severe short-term debt pressure, but Edison is in the worst  position.  Edison Due Thursday: Dynegy note; Dynegy has threaten to take take Edison into  bankruptcy court if they default   PG&E Current available: $500M in cash and reserves Due Feb:  1st - $580M to ISO  15th - $431M to California Power Exchange   Contrary to press reports and leaks from the Governor's office yesterday  about political brinksmanship, Edison is clearly not playing negotiating  games and is really short of cash. In this situation, it is unlikely that its  executives will be making fraudulent statements. The bonds on which they  failed to pay would have a 30-day cure period. After that the trustees will  move on Edison, if Edison has not already filed.  They have three ways of  financing power purchases going forward: 1) the state continues to buy power  and sell Edison (and PG&E) power on a short-term basis under existing  authority; or 2) pending the passage of today's legislation, the state  legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long-term contracts  under the proposed borrowing authority; or 3) Edison files for reorganization  under Chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post-petition  lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets, which it uses to pay  for power until the PUC and the rest of the state government recognize that  rates have to increase.  6. New Hampshire Experience A Guide for Davis?  Following the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the  bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes.  The  prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state  government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were  unavoidable, passing a seven year rate hike of 7.5 percent.  For Davis, a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover, if  he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of  a settlement.

beck-s	 One of the issues we have been following with respect to the California power  crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the  issue post-inauguration.  In the last two days,  we have seen two signals  suggesting that the Bush Administration will not significantly deviate from  the "broker" role played by the Clinton White House:  1. In his confirmation hearing this morning, Treasury Secretary-Designate  O'Neill cautioned that "it is not clear that US intervention is needed in  California" and that the "Governor must be the first line of defense."  2. A source close to Bush economic advisor Larry Lindsey reported to us  yesterday that "there was little that the Federal government could do  specifically to help, beyond focusing on national issues (increased  production, transmission capacity etc.)."  Of course, the Bush Treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with  respect to intervention than the Energy team, as was true with the Clinton  Administration.  Yet Lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from  the official Bush view at this stage.  Further guidance should be forthcoming  with respect to this issue from Energy Secretary-Designate Spence Abraham's  testimony tomorrow.

This year will be, in fact, the 20th anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL:  http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm  Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a short Q&A period.  Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.  Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event. Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

beck-s	 Sally and Brent,   Just an fyi regarding EGM operations.  I'm looking for space on 5 for the folks with "no home".  The current expectation is the Energy Operations Tower location will be 18 & 19.  We'd like to have a final meeting with building services to finalize the floor layouts for these two floors during the week of May 1; they'd like us to sign off by May 7.

beck-s	 Steve, in order to be able to test the New Credit Model as well as to answer Credit  Group's  questions regarding the outputs from this model Research needs to be able to  do the following:  1. Run Credit Model independently of the other runs. It is quite OK for now  to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios. 2. Debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time.  Please, let me know if your team can help us.  Tanya.

beck-s	 Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating  risk for the Merchanting Metals business.  Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility  ("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end. The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility  late in the year end audit. The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code,  arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the  operational burden of supporting the OBSF. The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result  of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ). The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on  gardening leave. The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting  business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.  Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain  comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as  to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.  The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and  effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage  implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting  developers. The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as  to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1. Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process  tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all  Metals businesses. An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1  covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand  and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within  the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical  VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads. User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been  aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of  Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements  for the support of OBSF. A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control  staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit  timetable which incorporates  A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source  documentation within Enron Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party  inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will  not be received on a timely basis Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward  priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report  signed off by the traders ) Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation (  thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase )  and to AS400 Barclays account A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where  applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or  external documentation ( invoices/request for payment ) A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts  I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during  April   If you have any questions please call me on x34703  Regards  Mike

Research Group   Ms. Crenshaw,   Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end, please let me know.   Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your colleagues.

I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over  a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after  discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears  to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed  ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous  variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better  deal, please advise.

They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed.  morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we  talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related  activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I  think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections  were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't  get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's  acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.   However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of  Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to  them on that point.  David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their  gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline  access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after  walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly  found a beach.  In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:  Six year production plateau 85% TOP $3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the  tail-end of the gas processing plant Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo.  rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the  Trust Retention Account  I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.  Thanks, Doug            
beck-s	 You need to work for Sally Beck on this.  She is responsible for this and is  a Managing Director responsible for all mid and back office, outsourcing or  otherwise.  She must approve anything that goes out becuase it will effect  her directly.  Phillipe is also very reluctant to "sell" any systems, especially if we have  to support applications installed behind their firewall.  We are probably  fine with most ASP models.  You need to meet with Sally as team on this ASAP.  After meeting with Sally, let me know what everyone agreed on.  I am in all  day.  Thanks.  GP   -----Original Message----- From:  Abbanat, Stephen   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 4:35 PM To: Shelby, Rex; Piper, Greg Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update  Greg and Rex,  Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo.    Here are a few points I think will help.    ? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to  Travis McCullough this morning ? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part  of the bid yet ? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed  The following points protect Enron from significant risk:    1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth,  David, Rahul and myself)   2)  We did not quote any price for software or services   3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We  do not participate in this work.   4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software  from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is  not priced.  The option would be explored during a "make versus buy" analysis  within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).   This gives us time to clarify our plans.  I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of  the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is  time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul  and hopefully he can get appropriate input.  - Steve   -----Original Message----- From:  Shelby, Rex   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 1:55 PM To: Abbanat, Stephen Subject: FW: CGI Proposal Update     -----Original Message----- From:  Piper, Greg   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 1:54 PM To: Shelby, Rex Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update  Who is the lawyer on this?

Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very  interested ? Greg received Enron's materials and they are more than sufficient for our  current proposal needs ?

Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to Enron,  for review, this weekend and on Monday ? The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS ? Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.   We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our  internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on  CGI's advice. ? Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how we  might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems  solutions  Thanks for everyone's support.

Vince seems to also believe in the    concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has    already asked to become involved.

Regards  Mike    ISSUE  The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20 (OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.  Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being= =20 bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o= f=20 which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t= he=20 hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially= =20 took place on spreadsheets.  The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20 should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20 balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement= s,=20 particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in= =20 the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20 operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20 satisfactorily.  The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released= =20 during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t= o the=20 integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no= =20 OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe= ct on=20 the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a= =20 guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01= ,=20 functionality.  This has given rise to the following concerns:  ? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at = a=20 brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20 reconciled however). ? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as: ? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash = to=20 3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate= d,=20 and ? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.  These concerns are compounded by the following:  ? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20 resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in= =20 July 2001. ? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h= as=20 also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20 ? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20 experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.  Conclusion  It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20 AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The= =20 current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig= ht=20 timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.  To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20 reconciliation), IT and the OBSF deal team must make concrete commitments o= n=20 delivery timeline.

beck-s	 Just wanted to keep everyone on point in terms of the importance and  expectations of getting this King Ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months  and correct on a go forward basis.  I spoke with Brenda on Friday to give her  an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted  passed on to the team was the expectations that King Ranch would be clean  (scheduled and allocated correctly)  for March and foward.  As of Thursday  night's   P &L calc., unaccounted for March 2000 on Texas was a little over  400,000 mmbtus.  As you all know, that number is way too high and should be a  lot lower (on a bad month, no more than 100,000 mmbuts).  Hopefully, if King  Ranch is the part of the problem for  March and we get these issues resolved,  March will not be an issue.  I appreciate everyone's committment so far and  hopefully we can apply this team concept in the future to prevent crisis  modes like this from here on out.  If anyone has questions or concerns,  please do not hesitate to let me know.  Thanks!

I have been using it this week and it is pretty user friendly.  The reporting capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready soon.  Take a look for yourself @ www.oasispipeline.com..........logon:  north.....password:  enron........currently, no intradays are allowed online(only by fax/email)  because they want to approve same days, but they are looking at allowing them in the future.      --Mark 
beck-s	 You might hear of this, so I thought I better forward to you.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 06/08/2000  08:53 PM ---------------------------   Mary Solmonson 06/08/2000 08:57 PM To: Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Joel Henenberg/NA/Enron@Enron, Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: TDS project    I guess I have several comments to make to this string of mails....so why not  add one more mail...  First off, Thomas is following up on my suggestion to check into TDS as when  we met a few weeks ago (on other issues)  I heard about TDS by name for the  first time - although I admit I was aware of work being done to replace the  Applix functionality.  You had remarked that you liked the TDS functionality  and wondered whether that was the way to go rather than continue to evolve  Enron Grid.  It is unfortunate that Bill is not more cooperative with Thomas'  request - more in the continuing saga of poor communication and information  sharing between our two teams.   Clearly there needs to be much more communication and sharing of information  as Global Rate Services for many months 'bowed' to the Sitara team's  priorities for Enron Grid - which you now say probably won't be used.   There  are many priorities in the wings to benefit the processes of Global Rate  Services that without has caused us to continue to experience a high rate of  errors - causing large impact to the P&L ($600,000 just the other day) and to  the invoicing and payment processes.    I have been proceeding under the impression Enron Grid was a shared  application.  You clearly don't share that view as below you stated it is the  responsibility of another group.  Is that why you dropped pursuit of Enron  Grid and began developing TDS?   Perhaps IT could meet deliverables if we provided them with a well  thought-out plan and set of priorities, good communication, and solid project  management.  To pursue separate solutions to try to save a struggling Sitara  project may not have been the best answer.  We have exacerbated the IT  resource problem by having three applications that overlap in functionality  (Phoenix, MKM, and TDS) - oh, and pieces of ERMS too.  If that's the right  answer, let's be sure we've discussed it before frivolously and selfishly  pursuing our own solutions.  The 'users' you cite as knowing of TDS are not  users at all - they are IT project managers.   Will you not have expectations  of Global Rate Services to provide settled pricing as an input to derived  curves ?  Will Global Rate Services responsibility end at the Phoenix door  and it's someone else's problem if the price doesn't reflect correctly in  TDS?    Finally, it was certainly the intent that MKM would be the ultimate solution  for all time series publishing in the organization-but I believe there is  question as to whether it is the better technical solution and whether the  design can fulfill the requirements. I wasn't aware that the pilot version of  MKM contained any curve generation functionality.  It would be interesting to  know how that got done, when ENA IT wasn't able to meet the basic  deliverables of the MKM pilot.  Another disturbing element in all this  regarding IT is - why IT did not raise a red flag that on the business side  there were requests for overlapping functionality and conflicting priorities  - you know, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  As all have said before me, a gap analysis needs to be done and a plan  developed.  I look forward to increased communication and cooperation between  our teams.

Yannis and his group have had  discussions with Allen Severude's group regarding the TDS/Tibco  infrastructure as well as review of "current state" Enron Grid.  Myself,  Larrissa Sharma, Allan Severude, Steve Stock and Yannis have also had similar  approach discussions.  Please note that a small portion of TDS is the replacement of the curve  manager functionality that APPLIX currently provides (APPLIX is a trader  tool).  There has been much user input on how the curve manager in TDS will  be used.  Since EnronGrid/Rate Sever has not had an opportunity to handle the  real-time (publish/subscribe) updates yet, it was suggested the  infrastructure provided by TDS (i.e. Tibco) may be something to look.  Note  that TDS is mentioned because of the infrastructure.  The functionality  provided by the TDS curve manager does not encompass all the requirements  outlined in the EnronGrid documents (functionality lacking the most is  security, updating of "Published" pricing and the tie in to Rate Server -the  TDS curve manager is built on ERMS pub/curve codes because all the trade data  is TAGG).  Either way, the functionality that we have all been working  through regarding how curves get published as well as subscribed to does not  change.  Keep in mind that MKM also has curve generation functionality (to my  knowledge, no one in Houston was part of this development).   From a technical perspective, several items need to be addressed:   Review/decision as to the technical direction of EnronGrid/Rate Server  infrastructure and publish/subscribe real time development.  Rate Server has no front end for curve generation.  EnronGrid was modified  to provide this functionality; however EnronGrid is the responsibility of a  different group   (logically, this needs to come together under the same group).  Does the TDS/Tibco infrastructure make sense (current EnronGrid/Rate Server  design assumes the curves are always updated to the Rate Sever database and  then    messaged from the database (potential performance impact); whereas  Tibco infrastructure does not require a database update first)  Does the MKM curve publish/subscribe supersede everything and provide a  "better" global technical solution (part of the London curve manager  development team will be in    Houston next week; therefore a briefing of the MKM curve manager is  something that we are trying to get done).  Functionally, this will require a  more vigorous gap    analysis review before a decision can be made.   I am open to additional discussions on the technical direction, but I do not  think that alot of additional functional documentation needs to be done and  timelines are not changing.

If you could give  myself and other interested parties a demo of TDS; I don't have a good  understanding of the TDS project.   If the project is similar to the Enron  Grid as it is indicated in Yannis's response, the business users need to come  together and decide the system of choice.  Yannis makes good points of how to  come to a decision. I would change that the users provide the important  features, advantages, and shortcomings of each product as they see it.   I  would gather the users' needs and timeline.  After deciding, I would then  like to get IT involved to finalize a decision.  I would like to get the  discussion started fairly soon due to the impeding business needs.    The first thing I would suggest is have a demo of both products to inform all  impacted business users.  Bill, can we setup a demo for tomorrow or early  next week.  Thomas    Yannis Tzamouranis@ECT 06/08/2000 08:24 AM To: William E Kasemervisz/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Thomas Araujo/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: TDS project    Bill,   I have had presentations of both of these projects (that is not to say that I  know them well).  Since, according to Scott the choice is still open, we have to make a  concious decision as to which way we go.  In my mind, this is a decision that  has to be made by the user with my team's support.  I do not want and should  not drive this decision.  The decision should be driven by the user, based on  usage (business) requirements.  What the Phoenix group will provide is a  server that does (or soon will) satisfy your business requirements.  The  front end plug in is, I think,  a decoupled issue in a server-client  environment.  On the other hand, I think we should help you with the choice (if you so want  us).  I would actively consult with you to set up the choosing process, which  I imagine would go somewhat like this: I would suggest that we do, again and all deciding parties together,  get  demos of each of these products.  Business should put together a bullet point list of the functionality needed  (even a timeline) and how the tool will be used so both Allan and Mike  understand your needs clearly. I also suggest that we ask TDS and Enron Grid  to provide us with a short  document outlining the important features, advantages and shortcomings of  each product as they see it.  Released features should be separated from  future improvements; the latter should be be accompanied by a time line.   Limitations should be listed explicitly. We take our impressions from the demos along with the writeups in a room and  make the decision. If needed, business might have to spend the time to play with each of these  products for a short period of time.  In my mind it is important to make choices like this one that will affect  business for a long time based on enumerated and well understood facts (such  that usually get lost from a short demo).

beck-s	 Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark  Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right  thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the  service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as  soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs  regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider  the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary  when you meet with Mark.  First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial  confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that  time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.   We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in  Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.    Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by  Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep  audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent  out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are  periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in  the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the  confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the  confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big  problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out,  which is even a bigger problem.    Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston  generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the  transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the  confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by  legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if  done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron  North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the  counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of  execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the  follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary  office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same  pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where  there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston,  or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare  our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element  of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are  we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?  Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in  Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has  staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are  reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations,  route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is  complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on  issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading  company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the  transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these  documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for  the financial confirmations without adding any staff.  Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the  confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.   Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the  confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the  transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the  financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.  Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my  existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the  company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of  the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas  such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to  keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the  confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already  exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full  accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity  to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.  As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring  that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function  properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to  get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this  function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the  impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I  hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to  look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that  exists here.  If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in  this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very  strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please  let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.  Thanks, Peggy

beck-s	 I wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for Analysts if you  currently have or will have one in your RC for the year 2000.  The analyst  program is being handled differently than it was in 1999.  In addition to the  normal salary, benefits and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an  overhead administration fee for the program.  You will be charged the  following MONTHLY amounts for each analyst in the Detail Class code that I  have indicated below:  Detail Class  Description   Amount       1  Salaries and Wages                   $4,000         552  Benefits                         774         557  Payroll Taxes                         360         820  Corporate Services                      1,266     Total MONTHLY Cost                   $6,400   The $4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not  indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid.  This amount will not change in  February as the $4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000.  The $1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program,  including campus recruiting and office visits.  When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled  "A and A  Reclass" in each of the Detail Classes identified above.  Enron North America  is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts.  Financial Operations  makes a manual Journal Entry each month to charge the appropriate RC.  Please  check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for  the correct number of analysts you have currently.  If there are any errors,  please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich  to have it corrected in February.  Please continue to check your RC report  each month going forward.  Thanks.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Lisa Cousino x3-6343

A time span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.  The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April 27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel arrangements on this end if so desired.  We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary equipment for your presentation.  We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.    Sincerely   W. Fitzgibbon    
beck-s	 Hi Dorn & John, as you discovered recently, I am still 'officially' in Vince  Kaminski's group (my original Enron Corp. group). This holds true for Shalesh  Ganjoo as well.  I did not explicitly pick Dorn or John as reviewers thinking  that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting  structure.    So, Vince has agreed to 'host' the review in his group and proceed to  transfer me over to EBS officially when this quarter is overs (Apprently that  was scheduled to be automatic).  In the mean time, Vasant, Stinson or Vince  would like to get a e-mail from either Dorn or John regarding my performance  from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.  I had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement  with my family already.  Since I am not reviewing Shalesh directly (since he  is in Research under Stionson), I am assuming I don't have to attend the  review meetin tommorrow. I'll be on the road starting in the morning.  If I  change this, I am told at home, that I will be in the market for another  family!  I can phone in if that is okay.   Kayla, could you page me with the details?  Regards,   Ravi.

beck-s	 Daren,   In 12/00, Gary Hanks asked me to add an additional nom to meters 3509 & 3533  to make it total 2500.  I asked you about it and you said that you would  probably have to increase the Reliant Energy-Entex nom (Deal 292249).  In the  meantime I added the additional volume to strangers gas so that gas control  could see a 2500 nom.  I have been allocating all the gas to Reliant for  12/00.  For 1/01, do you want to increase those noms?  Let me know.     
beck-s	 It seems to me that there have been several issues recently involving data  feeds from measurement.  Regardless of the issue, you all seem to express the  same concern:  a lack of accountability, no sense of urgency.....  I brought this up in Brian's staff meeting yesterday, in hopes to get some  ideas on where to go to get some results.  Rita, I understaood from you that  Gary has returned your call and you are setting a meeting for later this  week.  Please include me in the meeting.

I  have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to  reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT  perspective.  The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a  different problem every day (metacalc, servers going down, Lotus Notes  problems...).  I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate.   I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that  these problems do not continue.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Brent A Price/HOU/ECT on 13/10/2000 09:47  ---------------------------

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application  of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news  article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min,  etc.   I am in particular referring to the news article below:  http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm  In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for  t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in  particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could  provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.   Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has  a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts  of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich)  is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....   Thank you!    Regards, Christian

beck-s	 TITLE: Access on the Block: International Transmission Auctions Are Opening  European Power Markets  E-mail Category: CERA Insight  CERA Knowledge Area: European Power   Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission  system operators, regulators, and the European Commission in Florence,  auctions of international transmission capacity (ITC) in France, the United  Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, and the  Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single European marketplace.  However, the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues  unresolved. The most significant of these include the potential for gaming,  third-party transit, and the allocation of auction proceeds. As they stand,  these issues, CERA believes, are likely to lead to action at the European  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme.  Nevertheless, current plans to open most of Europe's ITC represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001.  International Auctions Are Opening Markets  A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001 (see Table 1). In CERA's view auctions for  ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas:  * Increasing market transparency. The posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly, monthly, and daily bases will facilitate the market's  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity. For the first time,  signals for new transmission investment, power flows, and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market.  * Increasing cross-border trade. Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially, the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade. Secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade.?   * Increasing price correlation. Auctions will replace nonmarket-based  allocation methods such as long-term capacity reservation. The dynamic  character of shorter-term auctions, combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity, should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market. In this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points.  * Increasing competition. Once players have secured access to ITC at a given  price, they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals. The result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike, resulting in  greater competition at the national level.  * Reducing the competitiveness of imports. The results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets. Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import.  * Spurring investment in transmission. The money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links. Access to international  transmission capacity between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros (see http://www.tso-auction.org for  details).? Auctions for access into Spain, France, and Italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets.   Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets  Auctions between national grids, or more accurately commercial grids, are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis. The auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators.  Even so, the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of European policymakers. In CERA's view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions:  * Third-party transit. The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid. This is ultimately inconsistent with the European  Commission's objective of a single European power market. The fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third-party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach.  * Transaction-based scheme. Although still transactional in nature (tied to a  specific deal), auctions fall within the European Commission's stated  preference for market-based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity. It remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets. Action at the European level  could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting, counter trading, or redispatching.   * Gaming of auctions. Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most. In practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided. Even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity, tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power.  * Allocating auction proceeds. One likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players. This will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation, suppliers, or traders. It  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid, as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation.  **end**   *********************************************************  Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, "Shooting the Rapids:  Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future" in Houston, February 12-16,  2001!?

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

beck-s	 Attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of EES.  These transfers will be effective July 1, 2001 and I need to get this to HR by Friday, June 1, 2001 to give them time to get everything effected.  I think I have incorporated all your comments, but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn't have or excluded anyone.  You'll note that at this point we are not forming East and West risk management cost centers.  Don and Rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point.  Once you have signed off on your groupings, Rachel Massey in Corporate Planning will be working with each of you to forecast your Q3 and Q4 cost center expense plans.  Please let me know ASAP of any changes and don't hesitate to call with questions.  Thanks  Wade

beck-s	 Mary,  HPLC executed a gas purchase agreement with CCGM, LP effective 7/1/2000.   HPLC secured the purchase of production from the Briscoe #1 well in Webb  county for 12 months; the producer of this well is Hoover Oil & Gas, Inc.  A  tap and meter for this production was set on the Big Cowboy system and this  gas now flows to the Exxon King Ranch plant.  I agree that this gas should be scheduled on Big Cowboy (GEPL) and not HPLC.   I erroneously nominated this gas on HPLC for the month of October; however,  did not do so for the month of November.  Hopefully this is useful information!  vlt x3-6353     Mary Poorman@ENRON 10/24/2000 09:03 AM To: Fred Boas/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Nick Moshou/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Hakemack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kristen J  Hanson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vance L Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Cotten/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom  Acton/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Meter 0980438 - Acock Production ??????    Fred:  I have run this issue by Clem Cernosek for further research, and expect to  have his answer this afternoon.  In the meantime, it is my understanding that  this well is behind the Big Cowboy system.  At this time, we have deal ticket  380710, purchase from CCGM, L.P. on HPLC/HPLC.   This deal should probably be  on Gulf Energy/BigCowboy.  The producer, as I understand it, is Acock  Production, however, I may be mis-informed.  Any insight which any of you can  shed on this deal would be very welcome, I would like to capture this  accurately and definitively as early on as possible, so as to prevent any  future issues.  Thank you all for your patience and assistance,  Mary    
beck-s	 Mark,  After recently reviewing the booking of the P+ options, it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated Geometric Brownian Motion processes  (i.e. the price process assumptions are consistent with standard Black-76 model assumptions extended to two commodities).    The payoff for a call option is:  Payoff

I looked at his  resume and think that he may be worth talking to.  Pavel ---------------------- Forwarded by Pavel Zadorozhny/HOU/ECT on 01/12/2001  01:37 PM ---------------------------   Dmitri Villevald <Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu> on 01/03/2001  06:56:54 PM To: "Pavel Zadorozhny (E-mail)" <pavel.zadorozhny@enron.com> cc:   Subject: asking for advice regarding Summer Associate position at Enron   Dear Mr. Zadorozhny:  Maxim Philippov suggested that I write you. Being a first-year MBA student at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.  The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products (commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a Summer Associate.  I would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at Enron and would like to find out more about Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. I will call you within this week to follow up on my request.  Thank you very much for your time.  Sincerely,  Dmitri Villevald  Enclosure: resume   <<Resume.doc>> P.S. Looking through an example of margin risk hedging at Enron's Web site, I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is  <http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer application)  The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "Paradigm and Enron exchange..." states the following.  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.  I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the opposite direction, namely:  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.62/MMBtu.  Am I right?  Again, thank you very much for your time.     - Resume.doc

Projekt rozpoczyna sie 7 marca 2000 roku Oficjalnym Otwarciem przez Pana  Prezydenta Aleksandra Kwasniewskiego w Sali Kongresowej. Pozniej odbeda sie  Dyskusje Panelowe (udzial wielu znakomitych gosci - m.in Jan Krzysztof  Bielecki, Jacek Saryusz Wolski, Andrzej Olechowski)  oraz wyklady i  prezentacje regionow Polski w Auli Spadochronowej Szkoly Glownej Handlowej, a  nastepnie delegaci udadza sie do hotelu Mrongovia na szkolenia, casy i  wyklady na temat przywodztwa.

[please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment]  .  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.  Please review the case and let me know of any desired  edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is  the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].  We'd like to "sign off" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard  professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In  fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this  semester, culminating in "Enron Day" at Harvard Business School April 26th,  featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this  Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken,  Jeff and Louise, which will help "bring the case to life" for the students  studying it.  Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard  copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked  up).

beck-s	 I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.  For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.  For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.  For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

beck-s	 Hello folks -  Brent and I have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night.   I am sending this to you for your own use.  Remember that we will walk  through this again on Sunday night to make sure we're still on the right  track.  Please don't distribute the agenda or share it with the session  participants.  I'm sure they are starting to ask the question - "So, what are  we going to do while we're there?" - in fact I've had folks ask me that  already.  My typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and  explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group  formats.  And, when they continue to press for more (as I've found they  typically do) - I politely let them know that more details will be shared  when we kick off the session on Monday morning.  Now, if they are curious  about what an ASE is and why they have to go to Dallas for it, you can cover  that too or have them call me.  Team, I think we're really close to being ready.  I'm going to spend the rest  of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you  want included send it on!  Let me know if you have any questions! Lisa P  
beck-s	 Daren--FYI  I changed the volume of the Tenaska IV deal 384258 to reflect the correct  fuel amount, it was less fuel because some of the supply was from the katy  area.....new sale total of 36,286 (after 8,406 removed for Brazos) 
beck-s	 Fred or Anita,   I just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same  page.  From my understanding, the allocation for meter 785: State Tract 121  is supplied from Bryancy Braumley.  Prior to 09/1/00 Bryancy would calculate  flow from certain wellheads, total this volume, and then send us an  allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to Texas General Land  and HPL (Sale from CLECO) at meter 785.  Effective 09/1/00 a compressor was  put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor, as well as the  gas from meter 9662 (Deal 137595 Sales from Dewbre), and is now measured at  meter 3527:Tivoli Station.  For Bryancy's allocation, she must take the meter  statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662's flow.  Once this is done,  she can take that net number and do an allocation between Texas General Land  and HPL (CLECO) like she has done previously.  I believe meter 785 is now a  check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter.   For 9/00 there were two deals in place for the sale from CLECO, deal 397957  and 449243.  Per discussions with Daren Farmer, Danny Conner, and Jennifer  Martinez, I have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use  449243 as the correct deal number.  Therefore, Fred Boas and I have zeroed  out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal  449243.  Deal 397957 was priced at ship less .18 which was incorrect and deal  449243 is priced at ship less .15.  Therefore, an adjustment will generate  for 9/00 for the difference in price and the change in location.  The  allocated volume for CLECO did not change.  However, I am not sure that  Bryancy is allocating the volume properly between Texas General Land and HPL  (CLECO).  I have spoke to her, as well as Jennifer Martinez, and Curtis  Funderbruk with CLECO so there might be some PMA's for volume differences.   In addition, I have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a  callout\swing effect 9/00.  For October and succeeding months, the volume  should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662.  Then  Byancy should take this net number and split it between Texas General Land  and HPL (CLECO).  The Texas General Land nom is currently at meter 785 and  the HPL (Cleco) deal is at meter 3527.  Fred mentioned that the Texas General  Land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on  that yet.     Please let me know if something I have stated is not your understanding or  you need something more done on my end.  Also, let me know who is going to be  doing this monthly allocation.  It might be beneficial to have one person  doing all the points (meters 3527, 9662, 785).  Thanks for your help!!!

Dear Vince,  A faculty member in our department, namely Dr. Keith Baggerly,  is interested in pursuing other employment. He is currently an assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member  of our department. We hate to lose him, however his interest has shifted from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application and development of statistical methodologies including stochastic modeling.  Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the same group of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at Los Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He has been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation (and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receive tenure.  Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background to support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statistical computing, empirical likelihood, categorical models and areas of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of "data mining". He is a creative thinker.  I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group, however I believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.  Would you have an interest in speaking with Keith?

I would like to point out that I want to pursue a career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.  I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from you soon.

beck-s	 Gentlemen:  Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research  endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of  a joint effort between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen  (AA). Its purpose is to develop "quantitative valuations of the intangible  assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy" (Business  Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to  intangible asset based organization, the question of "how to" accurately and  appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly  important.  Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a  team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead  accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected  outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was  made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1)  define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify  value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate.  Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will  be determined.  Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and  outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from   2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to  identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please  notify me if you are unable to attend.  Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes  from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How  Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert,  Samek - Arthur Andersen).    Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other,  please feel free to contact me.  I look forward to meeting you. Regards, Amy Oberg

If the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has switched we are likely to have  20-30 years with lower rainfall that      we have had since the late '70's.  We will still have winter rains, but  the number of really wet years is likely      to decrease.

beck-s	 Let's meet at 4:00.     Vince J Kaminski 06/01/2000 09:19 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim  Schwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: VaR  John,  We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues. The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.  It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR  system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative  basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a  big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D.  The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:   a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                      code to review it.   b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                     the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can  propose, is to develop for                     the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to  review the fwd vol curve                     before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,   it can be smoothed.  Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?   Vince   
beck-s	 We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is  45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a  problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up  with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1  only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I  think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the  purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73  booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be  able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can  see the numbers.       Megan

I have talked with Christy Young and Beth Miertschin, the college recruiters for the A&A Program regarding my interest in an internship at Enron this summer.  I understand that within the Analyst Program, there are 4 rotational options; of those, I would be most interested in one of the "Finance rotations."  I would be happy to explore one of the number of groups within this area.  (Please let me know if this is sufficient or if you will need me to give more specific indication of which department I would like to be considered for an internship.)  I greatly appreciate your consideration regarding my job opportunities with Enron.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to facilitate this process.  I look forward to our meeting again.  Sincerely, Van Ngo  P.S. Shirley, I have mailed to you my parking permit.  Please contact me if you had any problems with it.              - MyResume.doc

beck-s	 Vince-  I spoke with Roy Kass of the Energy Information Agency this morning. Apart  from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published  state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists  find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more  significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe  weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there  being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich  texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and  investment issues.

beck-s	 Per our conversation, the months relating to the CILCO deal with ENA - Texas  are May 1999 - Sept 1999.    However, when Howard and I talked about correcting the allocation in POPS,  Howard is telling me that the CILCO sale is tied to the transport (206)  contract in POPS.  If we remove the sale b/t ENA -TX and CILCO and put the  sale b/t ENA-TX and the storage book, we no longer have a sale to tie to the  transport.  Let me know what you think as we did not discuss this.    Thanks! 
beck-s	 Marty:  Absolutely yes! We are now using option functions in the Exotic options  library (in R:\Exotica which everybody in Risk Management has access to)  instead of the old Visual Basic code in the powermod file. This improved the  calculation speed for options quite a bit.   We are also embarking on a new project to develop the next generation  structuring and pricing models. I will discuss about this project in more  detail with you soon and get your input, but the main goals I see now are:   1. Superior performance (speed) to enable fast pricing especially for the  underwriting group,  2. Proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to  meet future needs, and 3. Security/access control to the files.  The first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have: I am  documenting the current structuring models. This step is important not only  for developing our next generation models but also for the AA audit of all  the EES pricing models.  Krishna.

beck-s	 Daren: I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with  8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the  exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10,  need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you  agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be  exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no  exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is  nothing to verify our volumes.  You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot  deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved  to a new ticket if they are spot.  Thanks, Megan

beck-s	 This note is in response to your recent request for a status update on Sandra  Dial and her desire to  pursue an executive MBA program at Rice University.   In follow up to the discussion held with Sandra Dial, Sally Beck and myself  on April 21, 2000, Sally  indicated to Sandra that while she strongly  supported the decision made regarding the executive MBA program, she agreed  to review the proposal of options presented.  Sally indicated that she would  need a couple days to review the materials as she had been out of the office  until the present time.  Sally continued to follow up with Sandra on her  progress the following day.  I continued to follow up with Sandra to provide  a status update.  On Monday May 8th, Bryce Baxter, Sandra's supervisor  received a letter of resignation without prior discussion of Sandra's  resignation intent.  As a result, the process has been stopped.   
beck-s	 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : October 17, 2001 FERC Issues NOPR on Intra-day Recalls of Released Capacity  Given the inability of the natural gas standards-setting organization to resolve the issue of intra-day recalls of released transportation capacity, FERC has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re-nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline.  Existing Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) standards require a shipper that wants to re-nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a.m. Central Clock Time (CCT) on a nomination day at the latest, and bars partial-day recalls of capacity. FERC proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re-nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra-day nomination opportunities.  "By enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly, they will have greater incentive to release capacity, providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service. At the same time, this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the Commission's regulations," the NOPR said [RM96-1-019].  Existing GISB standards applying to capacity-release recalls were adopted in 1996, when there was only one nomination per day at 11:30 a.m CCT and a single non-standardized intra-day nomination, it noted. "But the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities."  Given the lack of "consensus supporting" GISB's existing recall standards and the standards-setting group's failure to settle the issue, the Commission is forced to "resolve the policy question regarding partial-day recalls," the NOPR said. Permitting partial-day recalls of released capacity, the Commission concluded, was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in Order 637.  The Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), which represents major producers, and Houston-based Dynegy let FERC know that they weren't big fans of partial-day recalls. These could undermine system reliability, they contend, by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems, overruns, penalties or operational flow orders.  But the Commission discounted these arguments. "...[T]he use of partial-day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements. In effect, releasing shippers using partial-day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity, and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation. Partial-day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut-in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards," the NOPR noted.

beck-s	 Bhavna:  The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called  Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database. It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little  hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the  numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.    It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep  this mail message as a reference. 1)  Add 12 to the expression in "PrintMacro"!B35 i.e. change  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))  2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be  printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report  went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name "Jan93" defined  as "Basis"!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are  recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  "Jan94" to refer to  "Basis"!A76.  That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to  Dec 2000.  3)  Change the expression in "PrintMacro"!B45 to use this new cell reference  i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))  4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers  shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the  "PrintFormat" page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999,  1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Don't move any numbers or formulas!   That's it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it  is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to  find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.   Regards, and Happy New Year! Grant.

It has flow every day after the 1st.  98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and  covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to extend  the deal to cover this day?  Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497

beck-s	 Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.  I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself  to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll  in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka  Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial  teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the  requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity  driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of  day Friday, June 2.  Please note the following updates: For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the  survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please  provide statistics accordingly If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email  Jennifer Reside If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction,  please call or email Jennifer Reside  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the  surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will  eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like  us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next  month, please let Jennifer know.  Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation  this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted  time.

beck-s	 Hello all:  I have some "good" news and I have some "bad" news.  The "good" news is that we are growing!  The "bad" news is that we are running out of space.  Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices on the 19th floor for "summer" interns.  I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is over.  I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left without any extra spaces.  Thanks!  Shirley

We  enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with  Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as  well.  We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and  additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January  19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We  plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are  considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either (i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to  serve retail customers, OR (ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas  for further investments.  However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy  Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to  suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind;  so please let us know.  We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but  here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:  Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is  in the annual report? What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure? Who are the customers and how are they acquired? What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron? What are the international expansion plans and capabilities? Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?  If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent,  will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?  After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to  schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly  involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in  the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to  call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

beck-s	 As many of you know, The University of Texas has its most significant  fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs  School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to  achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.   Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed  to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is  needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant  number of alumni and friends of the University.  On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be  at the Enron Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can  participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all Enron  officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with  relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a  chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how  you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide  to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this  time because, in addition to matching funds from Enron, the McCombs gift  provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.   I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment  level gifts.  Enron and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made  a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant  presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and  faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.   However, Enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way  which would allow for even greater Enron support and presence while  optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of  Enron officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.  Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50,  last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron  Westbrook (extension 37094)  know if you can attend.  Thanks.

I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions for the Research Group at Enron.  In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron (mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to compete for these spaces.  We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a "Speaker Series"  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.  When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?  Thank you for your time.  Rick  Richard L.

beck-s	 Dear James,  Thanks for the e-mail.  The info I sent yesterday was not complied by me.  I  took over the reporting just yesterday and am making changes to it.  The  information I will provide on the log from London is what I hear in the  morning meeting.  What I need to do is ensure I get complete info from you,  so I will send you the London information each day as I understand it and you  can add comments.  Thanks  Shona      James New@ECT 11/10/2000 06:45 AM To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Report on London Middle Office RiskTrac Performance  Shona,  Thanks for your task force summary.  Below is what I have already produced here from the London perspective.  Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were  especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems  arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail  ? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where  we are improving (or not as the case may be) on both a general and specific  book basis.

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this  (approximate) 30 business day period and in fact there were only 5 human  errors on around 120 officialised DPRs.  London IT are also going to analyse the data to try to pinpoint trends in  their area.  Please let me know if this is informative.  Regards James

beck-s	 Dear Vince:  How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After having been working for Williams for about two years, now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a great company, I am wondering whether there is any opportunity for me, either in research group or in structure group  Here is brief description about myself: Right after I got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant and in charge of the quantitative research group with 7 highly talented people. I have done extensive research and modeling about electricity, load-following deal and tolling deals.  If you need any additional information, please feel free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to hearing from you soon, thank you.  sincerely, Charles    __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!

beck-s	 Team,  As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of  entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will  position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.  Our  primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and  achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate  pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the  optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron.   The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our  Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing  operation of HPL.  Our origination strategy is to leverage our business  operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing  skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity  opportunities on the gas/power grids.   We need our current employees to  accomplish this objective across N. America.  We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the  Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for  processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the  Gulf Coast.  Our recent efforts to provide services such as business  operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third  party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.  It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our  competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related  matters with third parties.  Please come see me if you have any specific  questions or concerns.  Also please refer any third party inquiries regarding  HPL to Tim Determing.  Regards, Brian

beck-s	 How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.  salesperson talks to customer customer agrees to trade salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY  - NB: all lines are taped)  salesperson tell customer customers says ok salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out  and chases up confirm etc accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a  piece of the price as a credit no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office  no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales  office, just sales people all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London  Can we not make this work ?

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:  Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable. The suggested course of action is not an option  We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of  these controls.

I went down to the gap myself and redeemed my GIFT CERTIFICATES already!!!  I sent enough e-mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from the GAP! You know, with all the crap sent over the mail, it is good to know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual deception. Send it to everyone you know, and you too can have a whole new wardrobe, courtesy of THE GAP!  Isn't it grand?  ================================================ Hi! My name is Janelle McCan, Founder of the Gap.  You have probably heard about the e-mail from Abercrombie and Fitch offering twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that letter to. My question is: DID IT WORK? Most of you who tried it will probably say NO.  But this letter is NOT prank like others you have experienced. I am offering thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to. When you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish, a screen will come up. It will tell you how much you have earned in Gap gift certificates. Print that screen out and bring it to your local Gap store. The sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can SHOP BABY!  This is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world. We believe this project can be a success, but only with your help.  Thank you for your support!  Sincerely, Janelle McCan Founder of Gap          _______________________________________________________ Get 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite Visit http://freeworld.excite.com <http://freeworld.excite.com>     - att1.htm

beck-s	 Dear Dale/all,  Thanks for the interest... I have already contacted intranet development  about updates - they don't have to do much except publish the document and  maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you  suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of  well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit  risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have  to be written specifically for this purpose.  If you have time to put any  interesting material together (Word docs, text files or Power point  presentations), please do pass it on to me and I will collate for the update.

Can you arrange some IT resources  for us?  If everyone in Research works on developing the content, we just  need IT to publish it out to the intranet.  Thoughts??  - Dale

beck-s	 Pavel, Many thanks for your note.  I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, I'm  trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed  income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a  guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The  digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to  and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it  'commercial purpose'.   I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the  rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets  (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).  It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I  wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate  this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or  likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it  becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test?  Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also  be appreciated.  Gillian.      From: Pavel Zadorozhny on 02/11/2000 15:15 CST To: Gillian Lockwood/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: digitals  Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever  asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them  was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a  knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange  for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This  structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didn't  necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco,  Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was  about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for  quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to  Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.  I hope this helps.  Pavel

It is for RAC to determine whether Enron is prepared to accept this risk.  I  discussed this issue with Ted, and he seems to agree with this broad  splitting of responsibilities.  Steve    James New 29/01/2001 13:59 To: Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Sharad Agnihotri/LON/ECT@ECT, Tani Nath/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted  Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Research sign off    Steve,  I understand your comments but the 'sign off' is a cross functional thing and  research are effectively only being asked to sign off their part which is  broadly as you describe below. If you have doubts as to the interpretation of  a research sign off then it should be qualified to state what you are  prepared to sign off on. Other functions should be asked to do like wise for  their area which will mean that when all areas have signed off their part   the picture is complete. Somebody needs to coordinate this and usually in  London it is the Risk Management guy.  Does this make sense ?      Steven Leppard 24/01/2001 09:42 To: Sharad Agnihotri/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Tani Nath/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT,  Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Research sign off  Hi Sharad  I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to  sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to  do from time to time.  I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what  it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and  therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot  provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I  feel falls firmly within RAC territory.  This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other  groups after all?  To "sign off" means to accept something, which our opinion  in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical  note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving  the formal "sign off" to those best placed to assess these risks for our  company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view  on what is acceptable risk for the company.  Steve

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.  On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and  would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London  controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come  Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).  A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry  the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that  process would be an achievement indeed.

beck-s	 Dear Sally,  Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still  waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.  You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a  rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of  the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be,  but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these  reviews.  Best regards  Shona 
beck-s	 Mike,  Vince and I are eager to see if our group can play a role in helping you in  your development work using some combination of the OR experts in our group  and the resources to which we have access at Stanford.    Can we get together for a short planning session when you are next in  Houston?  Please let me know your schedule, or have your assistant coordinate  a time with Vince's assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (x35290).  Thanks,  Stinson 
beck-s	 Dear Ms. Beck,  I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.   I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the  position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result  of the interview.  I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job  requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to  the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you  can give.  Thank You,  Irfan Iqbal

beck-s	 Hi Vince,  Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go  to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would  overlap with Ben's visit in November and so some alternative arrangement  would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there  will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until  early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so  then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.  OUT: Sat 21st October RETURN: Saturday 16th December  Regards,  Anjam x35383

beck-s	 Tom, we attached both a consolidated p&l and an updated prudency schedule.  The weater hedge made $165,000 today.  The only odd thing that we saw was the  physical change due to deal changes with the HPLC Operational desk. This desk  is a desk that is set up to account for fuel, gas loss, and physical UA4, we  have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the  month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be  allocated. What we found out that happened was that in the last week of  February and in the first week of March Sitara added volumes to these tickets  before were were running comparison reports to see the changes.  Darren  noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them  out.  Darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it  were a deal between HPLC and Texas, but it is actuall as if we changed a deal  that we did with another region.  The value was offset by changes in TUFCO  and storage.  We released $270,000 out of March prudency to keep you flat for  the day.  Hope you had fun at the school function. I'll be here until about  8:30, so feel free to call if you get this. Bryan

beck-s	 Steve,  Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates at low cost and low risk.

beck-s	 Ted  Thanks for the note - coming from JPMorgan I understand the importance of VAR  as a key control measure and I appreciate that we may all need to do further  work to 'institutionalise' a VAR culture in Enron. However, in this instance,  I believe the initial comment has been taken out of context.  I believe there is a general communication issue here. Since inception the  business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity  measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as DV01on the daily DPR.  However, no-one in RAC/Commercial/Commercial Support appears to have formally  equated that sensitivity to the business VAR limit during the longer than  expected delay to the completion of a signed off VAR model. ( informally this  is being done )  I would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly  necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit  spread movements in the market and for RAC to have signed off this scaling  factor. Bryan Seyfield and David Wall will propose this immediately.  Finally, I believe both Commercial and Commercial Support for Credit Trading  are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for VAR reporting   - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible.  I look forward to discussing this and other RAC/Commercial Support interface  issues with you next week  Regards  Mike         From:  Ted Murphy                                                              26/06/2000 14:50

beck-s	 IN THE SPIRIT OF LET US MAKE IT BETTER - NOT IN TED IS CHUCKING BLAME AROUND,  PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ISSUE:  At the Audit Comittee Meeting, Jeff made the comment that the number of and  timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless.  Now part of  that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented  graphically, but I think that there is an element of truth, particularly of  late.  therefore, I propose that we work toward making that timing faster and  the impact more meaningful.    I think the following might help: 1) Cassandra will be our point person, therefore it will be faster than  waiting for the slower, more distracted and less organized ME 2) I will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications,  particularly at Jeff's level - I think that the sheer volume makes an  impression on Rick. Unfortunately, I think that it will not be in effect  until after the Dec bd meeting.  FYI I have proposed this at least twice and  have been shot down by Greg and Rick, but now that a smart guy is proposing  it, it will probably get more attention. 3) We should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery.   I do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know.  It has been important to AA for audit purposes to see "evidence" that Rick,  Jeff, Ken and Bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be  considered. Another possibility would be RisktRAC.  The 3-d solution contracted for  contains an "Executive View" of "hot spots" .  Unfortunately, even though  Jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago, we can't get the IT resources  to pay attention to it.  IT however, has been interviewed several times for  magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products  such as EnergyDesk.com, Credit.com, En-lighten,  .............................................................................. ..    Conceptually, Notifications should take place before trading begins the next day.  This may  be utopian, but it is fundamentally correct (just because Enron doesn't know  it is supposed to, doesn't make it right).  I am certain that real risk  management organizations have a mechanism in place for this.   It  may be  necessary to create a SWAG process that is lightning fast with a more exact  process to follow.  Please have fixed by close of business today.  Ted

beck-s	 Mike,  I have attached 2 files below.  The file entitled "Continental Power  Assessment.doc" is the assessment that I had during my eight week stay in  London.  The file has 2 pages, the first being a summary and the second is  more detailed.  I may not have given you a copy as you were on vacation  during my last week.  I did have lunch with Fernley at which time I  communicated these concerns and future projects.  Also, I met with James New,  Paul Mead, and Gregor Baumerich on an individual basis and delivered the same  document.  Lastly, I left a copy for Joe Gold as he was out of the office.  After reading your e-mail to Sally, I composed the second file entitled  "Continental Power Summary.doc."  This file is a summarized, one-page list of  issues with which you, Joe, and I are concerned (as well as Sally and Fernley  of course).  The arrows below each section points out the potential risk that  we are really talking about.  I am on vacation Friday, June 22 and the week of June 26.  Sally mentioned  that you are in Houston July 5 - 7.  Let's meet to further discuss these  issues and so that I may inform you about what continued work is in progress  for Continental Power.   Thanks,  Todd

They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed.  morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we  talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related  activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I  think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections  were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't  get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's  acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.   However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of  Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to  them on that point.  David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their  gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline  access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after  walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly  found a beach.  In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:  Six year production plateau 85% TOP $3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the  tail-end of the gas processing plant Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo.  rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the  Trust Retention Account  I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.  Thanks, Doug         
beck-s	   India: Enron aftermath     Business Line - 02/21/2000     Abhay Mehta     Copyright (C) 2000 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire     Power Play     A Study of the Enron Project      * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195     THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has  been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the    inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only  in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even    admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996,  which while commenting that "This case has    highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence,  political considerations outweigh the public interest and    the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to  justify its actions not only before the public but even before    the courts of law" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the  project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even    though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws  of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.     The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and  recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required    evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.     Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological  narration - of all events, including the process of bending all    rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving  unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of    India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.     It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by  all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the    concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only  facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'    documents.     All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including  extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet    committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were  opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to    their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory  'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the    layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity  generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the    events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the  crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen    annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of  factual information. The strange saga of the Enron    project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single  project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted    here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to  face the problem.     The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of  electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the    Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited  liability company registered in India, through a maze of    intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front'  companies registered in various tax-free havens.     Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount  to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.    1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a)  crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than    doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored'  figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the    charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was  to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents    (per unit) for 'energy costs'.     The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to  international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone    up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel  prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.    Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even  though international prices have more than doubled - we    may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a  total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity    supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase  I of the project.     Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X  24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at    11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually;  for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.     This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or  capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US    dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as  compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay    Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign  exchange as payment to just one project authority, for    supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.     The really significant point to note in this connection is that this  payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase    in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international  prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of    the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory;  the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government    indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are  mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees    extended by both governments.     The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by  all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the    Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric  Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power    already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that  already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200    and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit)  and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal    power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced  to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.     The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.     This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.     It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was  contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of    blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent  experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,    namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World  Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The    detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure  tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even    statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully  documented by Abhay Mehta.     Mehta correctly concludes: "We frequently blame external agencies - like  the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a    matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant  case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of    India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of  the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note    here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a  somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and    the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW  residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that    Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US  cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the    estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in  December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5    per unit).     One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's  crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron    saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the  story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.     For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on  'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no    exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation  of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current    'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of  rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.     The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the  Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and    Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of  the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron    saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government  were overruled.     And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of  power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission    and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the  new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to    be spelt out.     Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad  and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break    up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can  be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on    the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the  UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision    to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan  Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a    loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities  after the trifurcation - need to be noted.     That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that  tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP    government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash  even for routine maintenance as a result of the above    - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the  remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and    restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise  the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity    with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against  this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely    disseminated, read, and its implications understood.     What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake  is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this    country.     What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private  aggrandisement.

beck-s	 Hey there -- Life sounds horribly busy.  I figured it was.  Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since  now I have officially been replaced, and it has been announced to my direct  reports here in London.   Fernley (not sure if you have spoken to him)  is  anxious to put an announcement out to Enron Europe that Phillip Lord and I  are leaving and that Melissa will be stepping in to replace us. Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at  least say that I am going to North America Energy Ops, or something -- even  if we don't have all of the details worked out.  I am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial "  customers"  --- also  - I have never met Delainey (I don't think)  -- but  maybe knowing Frevert well is enough.  I am planning to come in November  (first half) to work on Europe's plan and coordinate with Brent, Wes and the  other groups under Frevert, so maybe I can meet some people then.  Would love  to discuss  Monday is fine -- as I am sure today will be another crazy day.  I know how all of those reviews are.  John Sherriff put a o5 per review per  day penalty on any dept head who didn't have their reviews  done by August  15th, and of course I was on holiday the week before that, so I had 2 days to  do 10 reviews.

It seems that every  organization has their own definition of "back office" and the processes that  fall within it.  So, I was curious to know if we had a consistent breakdown  for Enron.  What I'm wondering is if there is a "common language" across  Enron.    Let me explain where I'm going with this question - I know that there will be  participants from many parts of Enron at the session so we might have a risk  of different definitions or assumptions being used during the conversations.   If the groups define processes differently, even slightly,  there could be  some confusion if we start a conversation at the session around the kinds of  services to be offered.  To give you an idea of what I've seen, here are some different breakdowns or  "models" used:  In Derivatives Strategy magazine's annual technology assessment, the  following breakdown is used to evaluate software products: Deal Capture Special Deal Entry EOD Mark to Market P/L Calculations Settlement Confirmations Payments Payment Netting  The Bloomberg model, as depicted in Wall Street & Technology, January 2001,  has the following high-level components: Trade and Order Management Electronic Trade Confirmation Trade Allocation Settlement Instructions Electronic Settlement Links  Let me know your thoughts on this.  If you think there is a significant risk  of different groups using different definitions for Enron we might be able to  build in an exercise early on to get us over the hurdle.    Lisa P 5-6352

beck-s	 Daren,  As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for  OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a  physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is  that we are "overproduced" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need  to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a  corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to  keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not,  please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month  UA4.  Thank you,  Mary 
beck-s	 Daren & Julie: Please disregard previous e-mails. I see that price is corrected in Sitara! Thanks to both of you for all of your assistance!  Tess   -----Original Message----- From:

beck-s	 Rebecca,  As we had spoken on the phone, I met with Mr. KK Sud, a retired Secretary in  the govt. of India yesterday.  This meeting was arranged at Vince's request,  since Vince had been approached by Mr. Sud's son who is a student at Rice  (where Vince teaches a course).  The younger Mr. Sud had wanted someone at  Enron to meet with his father who was visiting Houston, and is currently an  advisor (post retirement from the government) to the Prime Minister's office.  This was my first meeting, and I have no background check on the person.   However, the meeting was interesting, and Mr. Sud conveyed to me in  confidence that the Indian govt. is very interested in solving the Dabhol  issue.  He also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of  NTPC buying all the power from Dabhol, but that this was still under wraps.  I have no way of judging the genuineness of this person, but he claimed to  have been Secretary in the Ministry of Defence for some 16 years, which is a  very important post in India.  The information he was conveying seemed so  important that Vince and I decided to update you on the same by phone this  morning.  Mr. Sud is leaving Houston on Monday so, as discussed, I will see if he can  meet with you on Saturday morning.  Regards, Sandeep. 
beck-s	 I am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a  background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will  circulate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.  Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in  the Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info  on this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not  continued to do this, etc.  Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep  water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea  drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make  these kinds of projects viable financially?  Bob Lee 
beck-s	 Hi,    This email is in reference to our plan for detailed discussions about Enron  Credit's modeling strategy.  Several meetings have already been scheduled.   Please refer to the attached Excel spreadsheet for further details.    Also, if you like, we can have more informal discussions over lunch, dinner,  drinks, etc.   Thanks in advance for your time.  Regards, Iris 
beck-s	 Brent and Sally,  After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it  would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.   Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for  doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together  towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in  to completing this database in a timely fashion.  Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business  would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1  2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we  begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture,  valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian  Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.  I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,  Todd   ------------------- Forwarded by D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT on 09/13/2000 03:22 PM  ---------------------------   Richard Burchfield 09/12/2000 06:20 PM To: D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian  Hudson/LON/ECT@ECT, Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Weather  Todd,  Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather  Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements  with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the  project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the  "Thunderball" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have  co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for  Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet  trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls  for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be  discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition  of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel  development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in  mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person  will manage the effort across teams.   Richard

When I was leaving London, the question of reporting lines was still unresolved. It wasn't  decided if Steve would report to Richard Lewis directly or  to structuring. Steve's preference was reporting to Richard Lewis. This issue was to be resolved between you and Richard (based on the last conversation I had with Richard). The 2nd reporting line is to me. The draft is below.  Vince  &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&  The Enron Europe Research group has experienced rapid growth over the last year as it has become clear that there are tremendous opportunities to utilize their unique quantitative skills in supporting both new and ongoing business efforts in the London offices.

Effective   immediately,   Steven  Leppard  will  take  responsibility  for spearheading  research  efforts  in  London  and  managing the London based research  team.   Steve  joined  Enron  in early 1999 and has distinguished himself   through   his   many  contributions  including  analysis  of  the "Supergoal"  scheduling  system  and development of a diagrammatic approach for  real  options  analysis.  He holds a PhD. in Mathematical Physics from Kings  College  London  and  an honours degree in Mathematics from Imperial College.   Steve is also a black-belt level instructor in Kungfu.

beck-s	 Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s  research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content  origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to  discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I  suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and  perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved  experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include  performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what  he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested  once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise  origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the  internship.    Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and  this is a great way to start.  I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start  around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.  Regards,  Ravi.  P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo  will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day  basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat  fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very  specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that  may be too low, etc.     ----- Forwarded by Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications on 02/17/00 09:27  AM -----

I will try to contact Beth Apollo.    Here are a few points I think will help.    ? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to  Travis McCullough this morning ? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part  of the bid yet ? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed  The following points protect Enron from significant risk:    1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth,  David, Rahul and myself)   2)  We did not quote any price for software or services   3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We  do not participate in this work.   4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software  from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is  not priced.  The option would be explored during a "make versus buy" analysis  within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).   This gives us time to clarify our plans.  I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of  the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is  time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul  and hopefully he can get appropriate input.  - Steve   -----Original Message----- From:  Shelby, Rex   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 1:55 PM To: Abbanat, Stephen Subject: FW: CGI Proposal Update     -----Original Message----- From:  Piper, Greg   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 1:54 PM To: Shelby, Rex Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update  Who is the lawyer on this?

beck-s	 I have written a C++ code to do the following: For a given curve, the code will filter out the seasonal factor.  It then fits the deseasoned curve to a smooth function of the form  f(t)=a+A/(t+B)c, with 0<c<.5. ?The curve fitting is achieved by using Conjugate Gradient method. ??As Tanya pointed out, this form of function ensures that  ?f(t)2*t - f(t-1)2*(t-1) >0, which is useful in calculating forward-forward ?vol. ?The outputs are season patterns (2 different patterns are allowed)?and the smoothed curve.  One can then calculate forward-forward vol?from the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back?onto the curve.??This procedure is not useful for VaR calcuation. However, I believe it ?is useful for other situations which require the knowledge of  seasonal ?forward-forward vols.  For example, in power plant valuation and?credit exposure simulations, it would reflect the reality more closely?if we add seasonality to our forward-forward vol in simulating the forward?prices. ??Attached are the spreadsheet and XLL file. I will forward the C code if?any of you is interested. ??Alex??

"VinceJKaminski" <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: Subject:?  Preface for book    Vince,  Hope you are well.  We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?   you kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts   are.  Thanks, Julie (we're getting  close)    Preface        One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches  for  the pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss  in-depth the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope  to help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of  energy derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is   very important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities  to your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?). However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or  models, at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should  rest with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.    In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to?  model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees  and Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the book.    In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that   can be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their parameters estimated.    Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of   Enron Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,?  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating  volatility.    Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such  curves are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined  curves. In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three  main approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.    Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as  energy swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback  options, and ladder  options.    Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model.    Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent  and American style options  can be evaluated for the models in? Chapter  6. Simulation schemes are? developed for the evaluation of European  style options and applied to a variety? of  path dependent options. In  order? to price options which incorporate early   exercise opportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This  tree? is built to  be consistent with the observed forward curve and  can be used to? price exotic  as well as standard European and American  style options.    Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for  valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market  observed? forward curve. The approach results? in a multi-factor  model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range  of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structures can  be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?  developed  for pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte  Carlo? schemes are presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style  options.    Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of  energy derivative positions. ?  In this chapter we discuss the  management of price risk for institutions? that trade options or other  derivatives and who are then faced with the problem?  of managing the  risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma  hedging ?  illustrating the techniques using both spot and? forward  curve models. The general? model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally  suited to multi-factor hedging of a?  portfolio of energy derivatives  and this is also discussed.    Chapter 10 examines the key  risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR) applied to portfolios  containing? energy derivative products. After?  discussing the  concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?  (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then  compare the fours major? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,  Delta-gamma, historical simulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,  applying each to the same portfolio  of energy? options. In this  chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates  for various  underlying energy market? variables.    Finally, in Chapter  11 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We  look in  detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan   (1997)) and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products  (1997)) for which  detailed information is publicly available. Together  these provide an extensive set?  of tools with which to measure credit  risk. We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy  derivatives.   Before? we begin we stress that the models and  methods we present in this  book are tools? which should be used with  the benefit of an understanding of how  both the ?tool?? and the market  works. The? techniques we describe are certainly  not ?magic wands?  which can be waved at? data and risk management problems to provide  instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics   Technical Document ?? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace  experience and professional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,  the right tools,  correctly used make the job a lot?  easier!

beck-s	 John,  I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.  As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.  Vince

beck-s	 We encountered a problem with the Sitara bridge this morning and it has  uncovered the importance of Risk's involvement in watching this - especially  during the morning hours.  The Sitara bridge failed at 10:35a.m.  and we came  very close to missing our nom deadlines on several next day deals.  We  (Product Control) do have a safeguard in place (our IT department is beeped  if a deal stays in intermediate status for over 5 minutes), but we did not  receive timely notification of this issue - it was at least 15 minutes after  the problem started.  We have fixed that going forward - Jennifer Denny and  Torrey Moorer will be beeped in addition to IT.    We will continue to make every effort to watch the bridge; however, the Risk  groups (or some designated individual(s)) must be watching this as well to  ensure that any deals that fail are entered into the downstream systems on a  timely basis, and primarily to alert us of any problems ASAP.  If anyone in  your respective groups need additional training or assistance, please call  Jennifer Denny at x35824 or Torrey Moorer at x36218.   I have attached a file with the 35 transactions that were in intermediate  status (just fyi)   Please call me if you have any questions.  Sheri x36557

beck-s	 Vince,   LIBERTY GAS STORAGE PROJECT - We appreciated the insight from Zimin Lu on the  Liberty Gas Storage project.  I had originally thought that Enron could  negotiate a deal directly with HNG Storage Co. on the joint development of  these facilities.  However, HNGS has now retained Wasserstein Pirella to  "market" the opportunity.  [FYI - Wasserstein was the Investment Banker that  handled the recent sale of the Market Hub Partners storage facilities, so  they certainly would have a current list of interested parties.]   Unfortuneately, we will now have to participate in another "auction" if we  are to pursue this further.  I'll let you know what we decide to do.  ALASKA / NORTHERN CANADA PIPELINE - I would like to discuss ways that Enron  might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring  substantial new gas reserves from Alaska and northern Canada to the lower  48.  A large equity investment in a very expensive, regulated pipeline is not  likely to get much support within Enron.  Instead, our competitive advantage  may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the  existing US pipeline grid, ("backhaul" on Northern Natural, expansion  opportunities on Northern Border and NNG, or even capacity exchanges with  other pipeline operators).  I think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact  of the evolving North American marketplace on that initiative, and vice  versa.  Any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual "winners"  and "losers" if / when that large volume of new gas enters the market would  be valuable.   I will look forward to our discussion tomorrow (Thursday) at 1:30 PM.    Regards, JNG

After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit   risk management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer  my experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology   and methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit  trading managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in   trading, origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.  I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and  management.  I have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with  KMV Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV  in designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar  with its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the  empirical research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private  firm EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during  the creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.  I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming  skills. I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied  credit risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join  the credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my  combination of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience   and technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the   credit derivatives trading and risk management function.  I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me  at 201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss  this opportunity further.

Attached is a word version of the previous outline. I have also included some comments from previous delegates on what they would like to see this year. Most points address the level we should aim for and the balance of theory and practical applications. I hope these points help you to improve on what is already our premier EPRM training course.  I would like to confirm the final points and any new biographical details by Thursday, March 22nd in order to allow us a strong lead time to market the event. If you have any questions, please call me on 212 925 6990 extension 225 or send me an email.  As a checklist these are the points I would like to clarify:  1. Confirmed availability for venues outlined in the draft programme.  London, 28 & 29 June  New York, 9 & 10 July  Houston, 16 & 17 July  Unless specified on the draft, each speaker is down for each of the three venues. Please let me know if this is not possible.  2. Updated talk titles and bullet points. These should be updated to reflect the developments in the energy markets since September 2000. 3. Full name and job titles as you wish them to appear on the brochure. 4. Updated biographies. I will assume that the biographies from previous courses are correct unless told otherwise. 5.  Mailing addresses for the speaker packs.  Overall, the response to the 2000 events was extremely positive with a very high satisfaction rate. Key points from delegate feedback were as follows:  1. The challenge for this course is to maintain the right balance between theory and practice. Delegates have requested the most advanced research and mathematical theory for inclusion. The flip-side of the coin is that they also would like as many practical examples as possible. On the attached draft, where PRACTICAL EXAMPLE(S) are included as the final bullet point I would like to include a one line description of the practical example you will provide for the audience.  2. Delegates have requested more time spent on actual modelling rather than examinations of quantitative discussions of the energy markets in general. Again, I think that we provide a good balance between the two.  3. Basically, the audience who attend this are eager to attend the most advanced financial mathematics course available for energy practitioners. I think that with the current market developments this approach combined with the impact of recent events we will have an extremely topical and exciting event this July.   I look forward to seeing your responses next week. Please contact me to discuss the existing arrangements for travel and accommodation reimbursement.

beck-s	 CERA Alert: December 13, 2000   Title: California on the Brink  CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas   CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK  The California Stalemate  California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.  Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied  the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end  their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market.   The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is  possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail  to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws.   In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western  markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem.  Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated  changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a  challenging siting and permitting process.  Medicine Worse than the Illness  Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of  California's electric market woes.*   * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power  plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities.  * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state.   * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including  the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development.  * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the  FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development.  * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.  CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West  are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of  older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors.  California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state.   Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001.  In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage.   The Road to Recovery  There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall:   * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal  some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.?   * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build.  * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence  (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With  the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move  toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If  they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.  * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although  originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response.  * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "Boom Bust" characteristic of  the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate)  future price volatility.  * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to  be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term  contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the  market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to  do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its  course.   * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions.   * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA  power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power.   **end**   This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.   **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

beck-s	 Here are some ideas for discussion this  week.?? ? Next week we won't be meeting, and after that we  will have only two meeting  times left before Christmas.? Be thinking about  what you'll want to do as a  group?for the last meeting, since it'll be here  real soon.? Some groups have  a party, with a Chinese gift exchange (why is  it called Chinese?), or some  go to eat somewhere and then go as a group in a van  or suburban to look at  Christmas lights, etc.? If your group doesn't have  some tradition or  enjoyable end to the semester, be imaginative and see if you  can't come up  with something fun to do.? Of course if you need help let me  know! ?

beck-s	 Mark, this is a good point.  In Moody's June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for  Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year  of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year).   Reading from the  graph finds:      As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the  average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years  and standard deviation of 1.20 years).  The interesting point is the slide in  recovery value 1996 to 1998.   One would wonder if the mix of high-yield  issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries  (quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).    Interesting to note is the December 1999 to December 2000 change in spreads.   The table below divides the December 2000 spreads by the December 1999  spreads.   One would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this  time-frame, but the figures are more mixed:          To: Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@ENRON, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David  Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Re: Default rates    Per our discussion, see attached for impact of assumed recovery rates:      Michael Tribolet@ENRON 12/11/2000 08:09 AM To: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J  Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Ruane/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Default rates   Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.

We also need to look at staffing,  skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at  an agenda. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES on 12/10/2000  07:08 AM ---------------------------   Michael Tribolet@ENRON 12/09/2000 03:51 PM To: Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES cc:   Subject: Default rates  I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market  implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.

beck-s	 Dear Sally:  I am a new member of Jay Webb's EnronOnline technical team.  In my role, I  have had the opportunity to review the EOL Reporting Database created by  Eugenio Perez.  Eugenio has demonstrated good technical and problem solving  skills in the development of the Reporting Database.  He was able to apply  his knowledge of Microsoft Access and expand his programming skills.  He  quickly developed an application that served the immediate needs of EOL.   Eugenio should be commended for growing his technical skills to develop his  first Access application.  Sincerely, Chris

beck-s	 Mark,  Two points.   1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power  Play", is on a tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40  people attended.  2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an  article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself.  I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.  b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up  with a term "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."  c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.  d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts.  The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.    Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players.  Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.

beck-s	 Daren, Sanchez Oil & Gas has 3 wells(their Highlander wells) connected to HPL at Meter No. 98-9760. These wells are flowing approx. 20,000/d and Sanchez would like to have a bid for the gas beginning December 1 for 1 year. Their term will be up w/ HPL then. Can we get a transport bid from HPL to wherever you need the gas and I can buy it at receipt point less their transport or we can buy it at the Meter. I know the rate will not be "pretty", but there are other reasons Sanchez may prefer to have Enron buy their gas. Let's discuss at your convenience. (There is no rush now, buit I'd like to be looking at it in the next month). Thanks.

beck-s	 Vince, I just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the  computer system (it says that I have 0 C/over days).  It was November 3, 1999 when I asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation  days to the next year . I was thinking that if you (or HR) do not approve I could at least take these  days in 1999.   I know that your tried to help me and sent to  Brad McSherry the  justification for me to carry over 10 days. I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your  response was optimistic I did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.  Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake.  I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/00 to 3/17/00).  What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response  from HR in November or December last year would be better than loosing vacation days.  I really appreciate your help, Tanya.      Tanya Tamarchenko 12/02/99 12:51 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Tanya vacation    Hi, Vince, sorry to bother again with my question.  I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).  Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry  over my 10  vacation days to the next year?  If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations  anyhow. I would really prefer not to take off most of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.  Thank you for your help in resolving this question.  Tanya.

beck-s	 Shijie,  Additional   changes.  Abstract:  The power market developments in the US have created several unique challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors  underlying the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to  fully deregulated markets in generation and transmission.   The title is fine.

beck-s	 Hello Vince,    NIe bardzo wiem czy pisac po polsku czy po angielsku :)    Co u Ciebie slychac ?   U mnie troche zmian jak ze juz nie pracuje w SCEM ,  a przenioslem sie do MIECO  ( a small Marubeni backed energy-america trading company ) . Bardzo rozne od SCEM. Najbardzij przypomina mi SCEM na poczatku z Joe, jak bylo 20-30 osob. Sa i minusy i plusy. Troche structure i research ale przede wszystkim weather.   TRrovhe latam miedzy East i West bo sa officy w obydwu miejscach.  California jest ok w zimie :).    Na bardziej personalnym froncie;  pamietasz dinner na ktory poszlismy kiedys na conferencji w NY z Catherine ( she used to work for Williams- works for Morgan Stanley now ) ,  we are dating  ( for a while) . It is a good story how we met. So we owe you dinner :)    Jak bylem w Atlancie to pracowala dla mnie Christa Grey.  Bedzie teraz konczyla grad school in international relations ( with Eastern European slant ), i zastanawia sie czy sa jakies mozliwosci polaczenia tego co robila ze "Wschodem".  Co robila to bylo przede wszystkim VB implementations modeli , ( roznego rodzaju) , Web based data collections, basic research ,  teraz jest w gas structuring etc.  She speaks russian and was in Ukraine/Poland few times on Peace Corp assingments. She is very bright and dedicated. Myslalem zeby ja zwabic do Californii ale ten Eastern European pociag jest u niej silniejszy niz u mnie :). I have here resume, wiec jak bys myslal ze jest jakis fit I will foreward it to you.   Troche tak mieszanka pisze, przepraszam   Bede chyba w Houston w pazdzierniku to moze bysmy sie mogli spotkac.

Working with a few others, including  business unit representatives, over the next few weeks, Jan will   review what's been prepared  meet with key reporting personnel in each BU to further understand each BU's  information needs identify similarities, differences, opportunities for improvement, etc. interview CAOs and others to review findings and discuss what additional  information needs exist that are not currently being met prepare a proposed approach for how the teams will proceed  At that time we will get together the larger group to agree on how the teams  should proceed.  So the meeting on October 18th is postponed until further  notice.   Please contact me if you have any suggestions or questions.  Thanks!  For your convenience, here are the files with the information to be returned  to Jan.

We are displaying what we call the "exposure tracker" on our site, which will  provide two benefits:  revenue enhancement by providing incentive to visit  the site every day, and control mechanism to automatically turn off early-  and pre-pay options if a counterparty exposure reaches unfavorable levels.    Credit has expressed concern that our numbers will not be completely  accurate.  We need your help in evaluating:  1) the accuracy of the numbers displayed 2) how to improve such accuracy if it is not sufficient, whether in credit or  in the back office  I would like to meet with you, Leslie Reeves, Bill Bradford, and my tech team  sometime early next week to validate our feature.

The approach we've  taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA  department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a  vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project  and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive  to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The  contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's  record, and can be a manager or support staff.  There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project.  Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic  records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping  records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable  and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what  is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be  maintained.  During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic  records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use.  The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into  file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the  contact answers a few easy, simple questions.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.  Sara Bolken X35150

beck-s	 Just to set the record straight, Measurement was not contacted nor informed  that the recorded flow was inaccurate. We are dependent on the field to  verify measurement information, and absent information to the contrary, the  recorded volumes were published.

We will correct the  statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion.       
beck-s	 I've created a project in LiveLink called "Risk Issues Focus Group", in an  attempt to centralise the communication between our groups.

Select that and then select Personal Workspace. At this point its a good idea to add the browser page to your Favorites as  you can then get back to your Personal Workspace directly You will see a row of Tabs just under the header bar and one in particular  called "Projects". If you select it a page will be displayed showing all the  Projects that you are currently a member of, own, or a guest of. In that list of projects you should see "Risk Issues Focus Group" Select that and you will be presented with the Project page..... there is a  search bar and a scrolling news header plus the following An Issues Discussion Forum A News Channel An IT and Business Task List Folders for Documentation and Process maps this was my first stab at a layout...but it's free-format, so we can do what  we like with it ....I've started adding documentation already and there are some news items  and a few IT Tasks identified.

Of course, no one test is  powerful and the efficacy of these tests breakdown for low sample sizes,  etc.  If you can think of other tests to complement these, please let me know.

beck-s	 Jeff,  I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate  Relations Officer at Wharton.  Recommendation.  I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership. The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently, the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies  worldwide.  The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K, that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE,  Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed  through grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The  choice of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time depending on the business needs.  Benefits to Enron.   Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:   - gaining advance access to current academic research    - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,    enhancing   our recruiting efforts  - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant                    influence on public opinion         - gaining access to high quality executive education programs  Specific Programs.  The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects.  I have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.  1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella     for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research  and      corporate engagement related to e-commerce.      Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and     enhanced recruitment opportunities.  2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary     program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing  intellectual     property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal     organizational structures.      Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of  valuation of     intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.  3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for     assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the  scope     of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments).       Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination     of information about our capabilities in this area.  Potential users of the program at Enron.  My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and  Decision Process Center.  Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of  Enron can be involved  with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.  Vince 
beck-s	 I have Louise locked in for June 15th in the am.  Now I need your help in  securing Rick Causey and Joe Sutton or Jeff Skilling.  Here is some information you will need when 'wooing' them.  The first annual Global Conference will be held at the Rice Hotel in downtown  Houston on June 15th and June 16th.  The theme of the conference is  'Foundations of "One Enron".'  A review of Global Data  Management's(Counterparty, Contracts, Facilities, Rates, Entelligence) role  in the development and support of central information regarding Enron's  customers and relationships and plans for expanding that role will be  discussed.  Many topics will re-inforce worldwide initiatives, communication  between business units, and learning to leverage knowledge and expertise from  multiple sources. There will also be a special workshop session on  multi-cultural awareness to prepare our teams for working in a global  environment.    And then you say..... "Mary and I would like to feature you as a distinguished speaker, so you may  relate to Mary's team and conference attendees why consistent global  information is so important to Enron.  What value does constancy of  information bring to Enron....how will this information serve Enron ?  We  would like you to inspire us and influence us to meet Enron's diverse set of  challenges.    Take the freedom to express things you have learned and think  are valuable lessons to share with others.   We have guest speaker spots available on the following days and times  June 15  - 1:30 - 1:50                or 2:10 - 2:30                         or 2:30 - 2:50  June 16 - 11:00 - 11:20 (before lunch)                       or 12:30 - 12:50  (after lunch)  I would like to have you be the final keynote speaker on Friday, 6/16 from  3:15 to 3:45 or so (time for questions).  After that there will be some door  prizes, the video presentation, and a brief conference summary.  Then it's  off to Enron Field !  We would be delighted to have you attend all of the  conference, but if your schedule will not permit, we would love if you could  remain with us throughout Friday afternoon and accompany us to Enron Field  for a social event in the Diamond Club.  I appreciate your efforts to secure meaningful and well-respected speakers  for this year's conference.  If you need assistance from me, just let me know.

In the meantime we will continue to work together.  Once again I would like to thank you and Krishna for all your help and  support.  Thanks and best regards Sandeep

beck-s	 Vince, I hope you are well.  A question if I may.  I noticed that EBS's allocation for 2001 from the corporate research group's  budget was $1.44m. Could you please give me an 'heads-up' on what I can  expect for the dollars - in terms of people, on-going projects, anticipated  work-program. I'm aware that Stinson in our point person, but I've seen him  for a long while. A breakdown/schedule would be great.  I appreciate your help.  Thanks.  Barry. 
beck-s	 I am writing you in order to report the latest developments in relation to my  visit in September.  I forwarded the attached file to James New and Mike  Jordan several weeks ago and had hoped to discuss it with them.  I have had  no response and, therefore, I assume that they agree with the direction that  was laid out in the departure meeting (Sept. 15) with Gregor, Paul, and Risk  personnel.  The three areas addressed in the report are as follows:  Pool Book P&L Split EnPower Structure Modification Transmission Valuation  Pool Book P&L Split I have spoken to Anthony MacDonald about the progress and as I understand, he  has offered to devote time in order to inform James and Coralie Evans about  the underlying problem.  EnPower Structure Modification Paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the Legal  Entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your  Risk and Confirmation groups.  I have discussed this problem with Zhiyong Wei  (Houston's EnPower support) in order to inform him of the situation and Paul  mentioned that he has also spoken with Brian Hudson.  Transmission As of my last communication with Houston IT, the testing was almost  complete.  At the departure meeting mentioned above, we considered valuation  of transmission as a spread-option to be Plan A and further agreed upon a  Plan B and C.  The report details the operational risk involved in valuing  transmission by using the Forwards deal type in EnPower.  Since I have communicated with James and Mike and now with the 3 of you, I  have completed my responsibilities on this project.  We have now formalized a  direction with backup plans and I would encourage testing by the London  office to ensure that what meets the West Power desk's needs will also  address yours. If you need to further discuss this report, feel free to call  or set up a meeting.    Regards,   Todd Hall  
beck-s	 Just a note to tell each of you that I appreciate your efforts today in our  lengthy meeting.  I think you all were very professional, and you all asked  the right questions of each other.  I was very proud of the level of  performance I saw today, and think this group has strengthened over the last  six months, which was one of our goals.  The challenges today were healthy  and with merit.  I realize it is a difficult process, but I appreciate your  patience to work through the process.  I know each of you realize the  importance of our building a strong team, as we are only as strong as our  people.  We are required to identify strengths and weaknesses to help the  employee become stronger.  Enron is the best, and we are obligated to build  the very best teams to ensure we deliver the very best services.  If we do  not, we all fail.  Good job, today.  Once again, thank you.

beck-s	 Sally  Hello again, and how are you?  I guess you are still as busy as described below, but I hope you got some  time out from your Friday concept, and have had some time to think about  Japan. FYI, on Wednesday I will have a confrence call with Brent Price to  talk about EGM and Japan, from a Commercial Support perspective.   FYI, I am up in Oslo this week signing off Enron Nordic Energy, and are  comming to San Antonio next week for this accounting offsite, where I guess I  will see you? Any news on the offsite you were planning in October with Mike?  I look forward to hear from you.  Regards Jan-Erland    To: Jan-Erland Bekeng/AP/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Re: Enron Japan Commercial Support Model    Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office  in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought  processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations  personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.   While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good  option.    I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After  several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a  practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no  meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your  document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a  note then if there are any other comments that I have.    I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while  you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some  concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my  schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the  calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he  is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person  sometime in the not too distant future.    Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business  controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a  location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential  dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a  long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join  us.    
beck-s	 THis should be considered work in progress as Marcelo is aggresively chasing  the people needed to obtain the timelines.

beck-s	 I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to  curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

beck-s	 Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.  In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara  was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same  Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is  tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity  tickets to reflect the "other" desks:  a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path  Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like    "Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434  and will be removed." b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract  that you were using in the new path. c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy. d.  On the new deal:  Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply  or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are    agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new  desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent   contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.  Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select  the Pipeline contract.  Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.   Un-check it.  On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated  rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and   any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.  Hit Release. e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number  in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list  the  specific deals. f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message  should not appear again.  This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract. Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.  Thanks, d.n.

beck-s	  In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.

I am applying under the National Interest Waiver program in order to short cut the labor certification process.  This requires me to get letters of recommendation demonstrating that my continued work in the US is in the national interest.  Based on the work that I have been doing with utilities in risk management this appears to have a reasonable chance.  Although we have not worked together recently, I was wondering if you would consider writing a letter on my behalf.  I have worked with my immigration lawyer to compose a draft letter that would be suitable.  I have attached this letter as well as the letter from the lawyer explaining where to send the refernce letter.  I am using a transaction that I worked on with Edison International as an example of the sort of work that I do, since it was reported in the press. Edison was unable to hedge its overall short position, so it bought asian options on gas as a means of approximating the effect of higher energy prices.  This has turned out to be an effective strategy.  If you have any questions or want to discuss this please contact me by email, or on my cellphone at 917-446-4781.  Yours sincerely, Lloyd Spencer.     ________________________________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com   - GreenCar.zip

I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license, and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that direction after he handed it to you.

I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development, gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades, bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs.  I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more successful, and I look forward to working with you.  We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May 1.)

beck-s	 The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.   Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization  that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group  comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from  Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job  of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The  greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.   They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were  moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve  an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would  stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our  success.   Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried "Wolf!" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators "gaming the system" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that "generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market" - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say "apparently" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls "megawatt laundering" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to "imports" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: "I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan "a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout" from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=989601563&ei=1&en=6a900f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

beck-s	 Mary:  Is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow?  The large variance  between confirmed and actuals began in June 2000 where 30 MMBtu was scheduled  for Dix Ranch and zero for the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.  It  appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at Despain where  985,350 MMBtu was confirmed.  This well has never flowed this much volume,  and in June 2000 it flowed approximately 320,000 MMBtu.  Do we actually have  support (i.e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet) for the 985,350  MMBtu that was entered into MOPS as confirmed?  This trend of "nothing" being  confirmed at these three wells continued until July 2000.  In August 2000  this scenario changed and 612,388 was confirmed at Dix Ranch and nothing was  scheduled at the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.  From reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at  these wells that we expected.  If the issue is an actual increase in the  volumes flowing at these wells, I would suggest that you call our Gas  Measurement department and ask them to audit Coral's charts. Coral may be is  calculating the volumes incorrectly.  This could also be an allocations issue.  The allocation as it is in the  System today closely agrees with the allocation statement that I receive  monthly from Karen Lambert at Tejas.  The only differences between the Tejas  schedule and what is in MOPS are the Acock production and Gain or Loss which  are not scheduled and therefore not allocated.  I know that you are working  on the Acock production and Tom Acton and I are working on the Gain/Loss.   Tom will tell me how to path the gas so that I can set up accounting  arrangements for April 1999 forward.  Scheduling will have analyze and  possibly rework January through March 1999 because these months were  originally set up in POPS.  I want to help, so if I have missed the issue(s) would you please clarify it  or them for me and let me know if I need to do anything for you.

Per a  conversation I had with Fred Boas today, I discovered that two wells with  zero noms flowed a considerable volume.  They are as follows:   Rocher Big Cowboy (27002) - 42,000 approx.  Big Cowboy #2 (27003 - 84,000 approx.   Total flow:  126,000 MM's, more or less  I think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying  to account for, in addition to the Acock production at the Briscoe well which  came on in August.  Please let me know what you think.  I would like to make  sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and  our economics.  Thank you,  Mary      
beck-s	 It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality  flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well  as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in  ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your  respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in  the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your  respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an  informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:  Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other  departments Recent successes and current projects Ideas on the horizon Opportunities in your business unit for AA's  The benifits of rotation in your business unit An open Q&A session  These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have  handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them  ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current  AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted  Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a  presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between  12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.  Dave

beck-s	 Daren & Tom,  Beginning with August production, I noticed that Big Cowboy, into King Ranch  appeared to be flowing approximately 9M over the nomination/day.  Per a  conversation I had with Fred Boas today, I discovered that two wells with  zero noms flowed a considerable volume.  They are as follows:   Rocher Big Cowboy (27002) - 42,000 approx.  Big Cowboy #2 (27003 - 84,000 approx.   Total flow:  126,000 MM's, more or less  I think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying  to account for, in addition to the Acock production at the Briscoe well which  came on in August.  Please let me know what you think.  I would like to make  sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and  our economics.  Thank you,  Mary 
beck-s	 Dear Vince and Grant,  I am currently reviewing some of the more erecent references on EVT and its  application. I get back to you shortly with some points regarding the  usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from  EVT.   Cheers, Christian      To: Christian Werner/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Re: extreme value theory applied to weathet    Christian:  To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context  of Value at Risk calculations.  We have not looked at EVT for power, because,  to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of  price excursions: i.e. given tomorrow's load forecasts and expected plant  dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how  the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested  in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however.  As far as the  weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level.   Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the  weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.  Cheers, Grant.

Key points that will be discussed include:  Current status of any open requirement points (and resolutions to close them) Current status of Financials development and testing (hopefully some good  news here) Current status of SAP interface test (and we believe some good news here as  well) Current status of contingency automated interface to Sift (Net-net: It's too  difficult to develop this in the required time but with the good news above   we may not need it) Status and action items for FIT4 test planning in June.

beck-s	 Mark,  First let me say thank you for your assistance in making it possible for meteorologists Tony Hamilton and Stephen Bennett to hit the groung running this week when they came over to London from Houston.  When we came into our offices in Houston Monday morning, Tony and Steve had already gathered and analyzed their data, prepared reports and were ready for the Avistar briefings! The cross-Atlantic communication and data-sharing and manipulation went seamlessly!  We have great expectations for continued synergy with this new set-up.  The Research Weather Group is excited about our expanded responsibilities in London. We are committed to maximizing the value added we can provide to the Weather Derivatives, Crude & Products, UK Trading, Continental Power, and Analytics efforts.  We are, however,  also extremely dependent on computers and communication, associated software and peripherals.  Plus the datastreams we access and the reports we generate are very time-critical in their value to traders.  We need a very stable environment, with reliable back-up and 24-hour support to fulfill our commitments to providing the trading operation with timely, never-fail research and information flows.  So, thanks again, and  please do whatever you can to continue this high level of support by passing this letter of praise and thanks to your team, and show them our appreciation for your efforts.  Mike Roberts

beck-s	 Vance,  What is the price and volume that should be entered for October?  Apparently,  Engage changed their name to Coastal was the reason the deal ticket was  created that way.  Bob      Vance L Taylor 10/11/2000 02:47 PM To: Robert Cotten/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Aimee  Lannou/HOU/ECT@ECt, Melissa Graves/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Meter 5848    Bob,  You are correct, I did request a ticket at meter 5848 as a spot purchase.   However, I'm not sure why the ticket was created in the name of Coastal; it  should have been in the name Engage Energy US, LP.  As for October, HPLC is  buying this package of gas on a "spot" basis and a ticket should be created  and entered in to sitara.  Thanks,  vlt x3-6353       
beck-s	 Dear Vince:  Thanks for your response.  I am not a programmer, nor a "quant".  I am an expert in Excel and otherwise have advanced skills in the remaining MSOffice Suite.  Beyond that I have extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel on projects from networks to databases, and in particular, automation.  For instance, the first generation of the risk analytics system that I designed for Quantlab was done in Excel.  In subsequent generations of the system, Excel served only as the GUI - given its extreme flexibility - and a SQL database operated underneath (Compaq servers, RAID array), integrating real-time operations for all components of the system.  The research team at Quantlab used many leading edge modelling methodologies, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, principal component analysis, kernel density estimation, fast kernel regression, Hidden Markov Modelling and many other pattern recognition, walk-forward back testing, and other simulation techniques.  I was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading experience, and therefore, felt that I played a critical role in the application and implementation of each of the system components from data mining to research to signal generation to execution.  Beyond that, I was uniquely qualified to articulate the project's mission to investors, and therefore, was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and otherwise - from our network.  Althought I did not ask specifically, I surmise from your question that you are leading a research effort.  I believe that my skill set is best served as a liaison between research and trading, since I speak both languages.  I believe that I possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged in a group, project or product management role to integrate and streamline diverse systems and processes; a common scenario in most proprietary development settings today.  In closing, I would like to learn more about Enron and the financial technology effort therein through further discussion with you, or if that is not appropriate, someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me.  I look forward to your thoughts.

And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).     Background The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread. Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines. Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin. For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.     EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.     I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).       II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.       III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.     Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.   It produces indicative statistics such as:     a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;     b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;     c. the frequency distribution of load level;     d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;     e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;     f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;     g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and     h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated). Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years. EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001. EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units. Other EGE supporting data:     i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);     j. actual maximum generating capacity;     k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);     l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and     m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range. With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.     The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy. Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.     Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC) EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities. ELC transfers its "knowledge" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:     1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.     2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.     3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).     4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron. The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered. ......................................................................... Steven A.

beck-s	 Aimee,  Are you confirming these volumes with HL&P?  We have been doing some special  deals at Green's Bayou and the HL&P dealmaker has been calling to find out  what the volumes are.

beck-s	 Steve,  I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a  presentation on Enron (for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.  I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The  industry does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its flexibility).  I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow and send it to you.  Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start showing up).  Vince       Steven Leppard 04/26/2000 05:09 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Response from Lenos  Vince  Lenos got back to me, and said he'd prefer a high-level overview of real  options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants  me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.  Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and  I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date  have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I  obviously don't have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get  the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.  If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely: 1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation; 2. Gas storage; 3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.  I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we  prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I haven't used AMC myself up  till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price  curve scenarios being run through.  I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach  - people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and  they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my "Real Options  Strategy" document.  Cheers, Steve

beck-s	 Stacey-  As per my earlier voice mail messages, I needed to confirm what the actual  flow of gas was on PG&E for February 24th.  The Service Summary Report from  PG&E indicated a flow of 50,000 mmbtus on the 24th, however, the Swamp Rat  Fuel Allocations (HPL) indicates a flow of 53,000 mmbtus.  Can you ask PG&E  to confirm which of these volume is correct so that the February allocations  can be finalized?  Please let me know if there is any additional information  I need to provide you.

beck-s	 I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this  memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.   As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate  Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on  a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly  improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also  need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA   regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.  In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your  groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's  in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team  Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233)  or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our  A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this  regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you  may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A  resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.  In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you  to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm  the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer  another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply  their name as soon as possible.   Please call with any questions.

beck-s	 Norma:  you are correct in that Sevil and I have spoken about her Green Card,  and before we can proceed with this, we need to transfer her from the F1 visa  to an HIB visa, which we will do later this year.  Sevil:  please contact me approx. June or July so that we can start the HIB  process. Thanks Margaret     From: Norma Villarreal/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/08/2001 06:31 PM To: Sevil Yaman/Corp/Enron@Enron, Margaret Daffin/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Norma Villarreal/HOU/ECT@ENRON, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: RE: green card  Sevil,  I believe you and Margret Daffin have spoken about the next steps for your  Green Card.   You will need to start working on you HIB at the begining of  October 2001.    If there is any confusion on my part please let me know.  Norma Villarreal X31545  Below is dicussion between Margret Daffin and Sevil in an e:mail January 26,  2001:  "Sevil:  First of all we have to get you an HIB visa before we can work on  getting you the Green Card.  After you get your OPT, contact me sometime in the summer and I will start  working on your HIB visa which we will obtain in approx. October, 2001.  We  cannot start the green card process when you are still on an F1 visa - you  have to be on an HIB visa.  There is no rush - you will have six years on the  HIB visa - plenty of time in which to get the Green Card."  This was in reference to her note to me, as follows:  "I think I'll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and  opt. this makes almost two years. if we can start green card process now, do  you think that I would get it before I need H1. In every case, can't we start  green card before I get H1? Because I don't want to waste these two years  given the fact that green card process is a long process."   -----Original Message----- From:  Yaman, Sevil   Sent: Thursday, March 08, 2001 3:59 PM To: Daffin, Margaret Cc: Norma Villarreal/HOU/ECT@ENRON Subject: green card  I haven't heard back from any of you regarding my immigration status.

beck-s	 To:  Enron North America Corp.  From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon   In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20 implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20 continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20 people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets= ,=20 and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20 within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the= =20 corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th= e=20 following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the= =20 Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.  1) Coverage/Origination:  To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product= =20 technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20 businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated= =20 under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,= =20 co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a= =20 broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20 including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an= d=20 mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,= =20 textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20 Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.  Downstream Coverage/Origination  As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha= t=20 the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both= =20 ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand= =20 its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20 solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron= =20 Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function= =20 will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener= gy=20 commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti= es=20 but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic= als,=20 plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional= =20 capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels= =20 groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper= =20 will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20 leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three= =20 sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage= =20 activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f= or=20 the provision of innovative=20 products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio= n=20 of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t= o=20 lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20 responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20 chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers= =20 Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=  the=20 coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t= he=20 provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20 heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile= s=20 and glass manufacturing industries.     Midstream Coverage/Origination  a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o= n=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern= =20 Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi= s=20 group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus = on=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The= y=20 will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20 opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the= =20 leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20 Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort= s; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f= ocus on=20 the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20 emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc= hant=20 power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked = =20 Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will= =20 continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20 Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur= ing=20 opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20 restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav= e=20 asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20 formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of= =20 Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join= =20 this newly formed business.  2) Commercial Transactions:=20  The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20 Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of= =20 transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex= ecuting=20 transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity= =20 of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20 Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20 Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical= =20 Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.  The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,= =20 execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction= =20 with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of= =20 which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This= =20 dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service= =20 and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20 resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to= =20 the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:  a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and= =20 Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20 include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy= =20 Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of= =20 Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today= =20 from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20 origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr= ial=20 origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20 Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is= =20 established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay= =20 Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing= =20 two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant= =20 Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni= or=20 members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a= nd=20 John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the= =20 Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We= =20 anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few= =20 weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20 Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu= de=20 Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition= =20 of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.  Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and= =20 Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary= =20 responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will= =20 continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior= =20 commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua= l=20 responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20 Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai= n=20 largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20 Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located= =20 together.  We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag= e=20 and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri= al=20 markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe= en=20 the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20  Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor= th=20 America by working with us to implement these changes.

When he went on to different responsibilities, John Goodpasture suggested I get the dialog going with the right commercial people in Enron.  I will be in your neighborhood in the 200 pm time range and will give you a quick call.  That will conserve your valuable time and hopefully get me in touch with the right people.

Vince/Kim:  I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license, and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that direction after he handed it to you.  Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys? If so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development, gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades, bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs.  I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more successful, and I look forward to working with you.  We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May 1.)

beck-s	 Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all of your help that the  three of you each gave me concerning cluster analysis.  Your help was  invaluable .  As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster  analysis to define the commercial zones in ERCOT.  I only had a few days in  which to learn the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS and prepare graphical views of  the results.    Your assistance ensured that Enron was seen as one of three market leaders  who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market  participants analysis.  We were the only participant who had the ability to  graphically  display the results.    I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and  results.  I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.  I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results.  The  presentation has the best overview.

beck-s	 Dr. Kaminski: ? You probably won't remember my name, but I am the Ph.D.  student that took  you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State  University  during the previous academic year. ? I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at  LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career  in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In  part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research,  my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to  pursue a career in research in the private  sector. ? As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train  future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the  types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did  surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to  do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real  world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know  little about what their counterparts in the private sector   are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????   ? In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder  of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector  to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a  researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the  use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management,  Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to  learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company  that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no  such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give   me,?such as whether or not you think such a "sabbatical" (for lack of a   better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for   Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.?  ?

beck-s	 I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....  Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were "show stoppers" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).    The team worked on the "fixes" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.  They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.  We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.  Overall, we like the "new" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.  Call with any questions.  Kim Theriot

beck-s	 These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate  (scheduled) volumes for May. The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel  retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy  price for the storage book. The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule  6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility  balance, (4,295 mmbtu).  Thanks, Kenny  
beck-s	 Vince,  Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of  interest:  The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different  counterparties -    (Note the large part that Aquila plays!)  The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week  between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM for different categories of product.  Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded  volumes. "Products" is for the remaining categories.    There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon  software is now available, and can be reached at the following URL:  http://sassy.ect.enron.com/eol/eol_all.html  Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering  regarding EOL?  I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are  there any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?  Thanks,  Tom

beck-s	 Daren:  During the months of October 1999 and November 1999, gas flowed into HPL's  pipeline at the above meter.    This gas was previously transported by EOG  Resources  to Mobil (Beaumont) with the excess being purchased.   The Deal  that EOG Resources Transport Contract (012-36702-02-001) moved gas to Mobil  Beaumont expired a the end of September, 1999, but gas continued to flow into  HPL's pipeline.  Currently, these volumes are being recorded to the HPL  Strangers Gas Contract.

beck-s	 Brad,  As we discussed, it's very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stock's  behaviours.  We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market  indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as  regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables  show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods,  but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different  or longer time periods.   Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility  Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a  summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file  "outputSummary").  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.  To capture, at least  trying to capture,  its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.??Let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ?some new thoughts.????Vincent??

beck-s	 Dear Vince:  I just wanted to thank you for supplying a copy of the book. The article on the natural gas market is just what I've been looking for. The new addition, coupled with the first version's discussion of the volatility of the gas market in the mid 90's should be very helpful in convincing these government watchdog types that basis adjustments in pricing formulas are not some sinister plot to deprive the feds of their royalties.  Or should if there is any rationality in government.  Thanks again for your help.  Best regards,  Steve Williams EOG Resources

beck-s	 Daren: I have several months that need to have the demand charges either added or  adjusted.  When Katherine gave you the numbers the first time, there were  some spot deals included in the exchange deals.  The volumes have now been  moved to the correct deals and the demand charges need to be corrected.  I  have listed the changes below.  Let me know if you would like to see the  spreadsheets.  Deal 157278 3/00 Add demand charge of $73,403.47 for excess charge 4/00 Change demand fee from $1,507.56 to $1,966.93 6/00 Change demand fee from $1,129.99 to $359.97  Deal 157288 3/00 Change demand fee from $3,526.98 to $245.82  Thanks, Megan

Sista Cindy   -----Original Message----- From: White, Cara [mailto:CWhite@texas.usta.com] Sent: Wednesday, February 14, 2001 3:35 PM To: 'cwhite@viviance.com'; 'sally.beck@enron.com' Subject: anniversary   Hi, sistas-  Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:  We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.  Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.  I confirmed "17" with mom.  Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree, dessert) is $45. A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52. Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The food sounds really good.  So, here's a guess at cost: 17 people at $45 =  $765 Beverages =        $200 Gratuity =   $193 Valet =    $  50 Room rental =   $200 TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into thirds  What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara  Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas.usta.com

beck-s	 Daren,  I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters:  98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was  on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new  deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.  98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new deal  referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly  and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied.  Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
beck-s	 George-  In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the  referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well  piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing  approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may  want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.  Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently  show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King  Ranch.    Thanks.

beck-s	 The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please  review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk  scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in  January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.   Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the  variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for  the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is  the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.   ---------------------   Lisa Kinsey 03/21/2000 08:12 AM To: Kenny J Soignet/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: CILCO STORAGE  Kenny, Attached is the worksheet that I have been using to verify Cilco's storage  balance with Vonda Seckler from Cilco.

beck-s	 Wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might  involve your desks via EOL in the near future. We already have one in the  East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments  to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is  happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and  the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will  include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or  exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the  counterparty desires. I hope this helps...THANKS!   ---------------------- Forwarded by Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT on 06/27/2000  02:51 PM ---------------------------

beck-s	 Karin,  I talked to Mike Roberts (the head of the whole weather team), and he is  saying that all expenses for Tony should be charged to Global Products Team.  This is agreed between Vince and Jeff Shankman. Mike and Vince are negotiating with John to put Stephen (or somebody who will  replace him) to some other cost centres (via research).  It looks like Kevin Moore is happy if Stephen is charged to the same cost  centre as Tony. Let us right now charge Tony and Stephen to the cost centre below . Please, could we charge them separately - when John and Vince make their  decision, we should be able to re-charge.  many thanks,  Slava

As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at  Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our  approach for calculating VaR.

beck-s	 Dear Sven & Clemens,  I put together some packets of print outs from various links that I am  familiar with; the packets cover electricity and gas markets and modelling,  deregulation & exchanges, weather derivatives and value-at-risk/risk  management/case studies.  This is by no means final, and I hope to supplement  with some more ideas over the next few days.  Once you have considered the  material, I can fine-tune the type of material that is relevant for you and  then we can look at starting to put something together, after which we can  pass on to Mike Roberts  If you need some simple articles on pricing options or an explanation on how  to calculate volatility, then I am sure we can put that together for you.

beck-s	 Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.  I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and  several questions have come up.  It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.  I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with  our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It  interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is  what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The  accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.  What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local  Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the  Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to  interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need  to interface with the bank.      Please advise.  Thank you, Pam Perry

beck-s	 Hello all:  If you think any of your people would be interested in the following - plea= se pass the messages on.=20  Thanks! ***************************************************************************= *** ************************************** Message One  Dear everyone,=20  We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working= =20 on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all= =20 keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find= =20 out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,= =20 it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep= =20 abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, le= t=20 alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20 project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of= =20 this group.=20  As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag= =20 lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. = =20 It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20 technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that w= e do=20 not have to reinvent the wheels. =20  We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us wil= l=20 take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from= =20 theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing= ,=20 process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything= =20 one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have= =20 been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20 bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20 presentation style.  It could be =20 everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20 style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style= =20 that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20 presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon th= e=20 responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20  We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20 purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin o= r=20 Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and= =20 provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to= =20 hear your presentation.=20  We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give=  a=20 talk or just sit in.=20  Zimin Lu Alex Huang   Message Two  Dear everyone, It looks like the proposed BBLOP has great support and is to have a great= =20 start. Vince, Grant,, Amitava,  Kevin, Clayton and Chonawee have promised to give presentations to us.  Vince will kindly deliver the inaugural=20 presentation next Friday (March 31) on new methodology for option pricing= =20 (precise title TBA).  BBLOP will start at 12 noon and last about 45 to 50 minutes.  Let's= =20 make this a new Enron tradition!  Best regards. Zimin, Alex

To assist in the further development of the product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved ? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for some specific comments ?

beck-s	 I have included provision for providing rank correlation between "jump occurrence in daily average power price" and "outage occurrence".  The model will provide the same claim distribution as before when PriceVsOutage Correlation = 0 is used.  Claim goes up as the correlation is increased.  I have performed some sensitivity analysis and the results seem to make sense.    The new model workbook is "OutagePricingModel040901.xls" and corresponding dll is "OutagePricing040901.dll", both located in O:\GRM\RESEARCH\OUTAGERISK\  subdirectory.  The price vs. outage rank correlation input will need to be provided in "MAIN" spreadsheet.  Please call me if you have any questions.  -Amitava

I  understand the PRC meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow, hopefully you  will get it in time. Federico told me that you met with him last week.  I want to thank you very  much for taking the time to familiarize yourself with my background and  accomplishments.  Undoubtedly this is a challenging and time-consuming  process, adding to your current responsibilities.   I would like to wish you luck at the PRC meeting tomorrow, hopefully it won't  run as long as that of the Analysts.

Both the morning  Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the  same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is  apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to  cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as  soon as I know a rescheduled date.    In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with  most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities,  accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a  meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to  accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have  provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as  copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.    With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of  your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance  specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to  me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please  e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you  have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name  and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in  Houston.

beck-s	 Hi Shirley, please give me a few dates form end of march to first week in  April to do an offsite for Vince's direct reports (including myself) and  selected EBS research people. This includes, Vince direct report from our  research group and the following people from EBS Research:  Ravi, Stinson, Samer, Chinowee.  The agenda will include: Research people giving several mini presentations on  Trading, market development (history of Nat gas, Electricity, etc.), pricing,  etc...  John's people will do similar mini presentations on Optical Network  engineering, optical components, provisioning, telecom markets, pricing,  etc....  If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational  speech on the vision of EBS, etc..  It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to  know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at  the additions case-by-case.  John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please  follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John  has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with  Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.  We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole  weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel  (family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we  have a chance to talk to John & Scott.  I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.    Thanks,  Ravi. 
beck-s	 John,   I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but   this year too much was going on.   Two items I wanted to mention:   1. Tony Hamilton, weather support   Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent  a   few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts' team. He went back to   London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only   crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with   requests for help.    He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts' team, Steve Bennett, on a   temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).    Action recommended.    a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I   have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with  Tani   on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony   Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe.     2. Stinson Gibner   Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and   building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -   he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry   about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the   totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple   activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more   experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan   Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth   of support they expect.   Action recommended.   I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an   extended stay. To manage Slava's expectations, I would call Stinson a Head  of   Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include   coordination of research and model building for other locations than London   where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ?  reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for   reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London   in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you.    By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in   London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main   consideration.    Vince

beck-s	 Hi there -  Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!!    I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that  you and I discussed in San Antonio.  As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling  more and more exposed.  As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to  nail it down.  I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office  focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  I  know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back  office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key  controls.    Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with  Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be  sooner.  I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and  packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.  but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.  Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639  Keep me posted  Beth

beck-s	 Dear Vince: ? I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the  people in the group here  has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an El  Paso vice president, I  should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy  should not have  asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso, so, as a  human being, I  felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have  contacted you  anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional  courtesy, I would  like you to benefit from my experience with this  fellow. ? The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I  think he is reasonably bright  and seems to have a quite deep understanding of  general finance and  financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very  frustrated because he  had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority.  Instead the group's  M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the  structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand  his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his  nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting  with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to  dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or  shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat  Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a  bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate  environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my  word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask  that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest  assessment -- brutally so. ? 'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you. ? Best Regards, Grant.

Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should  have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285)  and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary -  230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at  2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.  2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged  $2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91   price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at  2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.  I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for  2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment  if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and  increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at  .0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.  In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price  is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache  invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at  other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If  Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a  margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant  should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.  Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and  October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from  Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot  prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our  meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of  $.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas  delivery points if my scenario above is correct).  So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their  November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price  differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of  $484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of  Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.    Month   Plant Gas Price Amount   November  267,300  2.91 $777,843    November adjustment    $(167,062.50)      October adjustment    $(184,138.99)   Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000   Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52        Total $484,234.03  I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before  reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts  that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.  James

beck-s	 Lexi, I have a concern regarding the summer internship position.... I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12 weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks. The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!! Thanks so much.

We need to begin work immediately on legacy system  integration--basically modifying our existing systems (Unify, Sitara,  Enpower,...) to generate first columnar and then (hopefully) XML data  output.  This work is most appropriately done by the people who best know  these systems, our IT group.  The development of the three modules is proceeding well.  We have designed  the architecture to allow limited-capability versions of all three by the end  of this year.  The key critical path item remains legacy system integration.   The key step towards integration is the appointment of a senior IT person on  our team.  Please let me know what I can do to help in this regard.  All the best,  Tom

I understand the basic concept but want to learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?  See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the "Business Conduct" and  "Drug Policy" language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.      Bonnie

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.

beck-s	 Executive Summary ? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt ? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short  for PG&E this summer  ? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs ? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for California  California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases  Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the  Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to  securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to  sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every  day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is  essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of  Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other  programs) to purchase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10  billion worth of state bonds.   Davis & PG&E at Odds  Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3),  and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their  utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is  being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the  states' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would  provide Davis with even less negotiating power.  With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and  State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a  special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.   Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.  QF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's  Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the State's  senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.  Out with Hebert, In with Wood The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat  Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican  Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.   The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a  fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made  several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation.    It's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal  that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in  the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as  BPA.

beck-s	 Vance:  Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal,  depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.  Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts  hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.   Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads  were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will  probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.  Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells  behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal  to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another  deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced  contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result  in a financial loss).    In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow  at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon  as I ascertain that date.  In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals  which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that  they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing  level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish  this.  Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area,    Mary

beck-s	 Attached please find the Hours Survey and Instructions for the month of May,  2000.  I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself  to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll  in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka  Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  While completing the survey, take this time to review last month's numbers.  Please return these surveys to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2.    Please note the following changes: The Nat Gas RC's will now see deal validation and transportation rate  activities therefore, these surveys will be notably longer but will not  necessarily take more time  If the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on,  PLEASE DO NOT TYPE ANY ACTIVITIES IN THE SURVEY.

beck-s	  In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures  on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth  below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to  exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve  communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services  and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific  transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should  be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become  standard at ENA.   1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written  description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The  responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve  such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide  substantial professional services.   2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised  written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and  expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by  $25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by  the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee  before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional  professional services.    3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be  properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should  be obtained for each transaction.     Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other  suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.

beck-s	 I completely agree with you.  Nevertheless, I am sorry if I did not make myself clear when we talked about  this last Tuesday: I am not advocating penalizing business units because of  their 1week ROVARs or Sharpes.  I would certainly not set traders' bonuses  based on these numbers (nor do I think anyone at Enron would consider doing  that).   Enron focuses on long term profit and risk.  However, the long term is made  up of many short terms, and catastrophes can occur if a company's management  does not pay close attention to the latter.  Indeed, Enron management is very  interested in short term profitability (they want to be notified of very  large 1 and 5 day losses) and short term risk (we report daily VaR limit  violations).  In this spirit, I am simply offering 1 and 4 week ROVARs and  Sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the  DPR database, and I will let upper management use or ignore them as they see  fit.  Regards,    Eugenio         Naveen Andrews@ENRON 09/08/2000 11:13 AM To: Eugenio Perez/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Risk Metrics  Eugenio,         In regard to your recent e-mail concerning RoVar, Sharpe and other  risk metrics, and our meeting on Tuesday, it is imperative to understand that  (1) While P&L is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis, VaR numbers on  1-week or 4-week basis, and consequently RoVaR numbers, are not meaningful  operationally (ie, trading activity and senior management decision-making)  and statistically.  RoVaR and Sharpe were designed to measure business unit  performance over extended time periods (preferably a year).  Specifically,  you cannot penalize, or make  reasonable business decisions about  a  unit ,  because of their 1-week RoVar or Sharpe.  (2) Significant trading activity at ENE is composed of long-term strategic  trades (seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months, perhaps), wherein  desk heads and  senior management have an intuitive feeling for their RoVaR  (OVER 6 MONTHS).   A 1-week or  4-week "interim" number  in this case is not  useful.   Traders might purposefully want to make  a certain 1-week or 4-week  RoVaR LOW in their trading activity if they believe their 6-month number can  be HIGH.  In such a case, a 1-week number might send dangerous messages to  senior management.   (3) Conceptually,  P&L and VaR, in isolation, are numbers which are sound and  rigourously calculated.  The Ratio, however,  one has to be careful about.   The numerator (cumulative P&L over a certain period) can be aggregated by  simple arithmetic summation, no problems.  However, the denominator (average  daily VaR over a certain period) relies on the underlying assumption that  each point in your time series is independent and correlationless.  To get a  sufficient statistic for the denominator, one would have to take a large  sample in your series (6 months or more), for a DAILY AVERAGE VaR number to  be meaningful, statistically.  (4) The RAC group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage   for over two years.  The numbers are shown to the B.O.D with the express  intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6-month or yearly tenor.   Please contact Matthew Adams (RAC) or myself  to make sure that we are on the  same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics.  Also, in the  future, just to be consistent and on-the-same-page, please contact me or Mr.  Adams if any risk-related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum.  (5) Finally, as you can probably corroborate, senior management might  not  be  fully versed on the nuances of VaR, let alone 1-week VaR ratios.   Therefore, one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics.  I liked your presentation of your database on Tuesday.  I think it is a nice  step in aggregating and dissecting  P&L from disparate sources.  Best Regards Naveen

We have a couple more   that have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final   decision.? If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that you guys   could probably get through the first day pretty easily,?and thus thought it   may be an option to teach just the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron   (doing it at the Hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the  large  side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We   can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?   ? I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know  where  we stand on final numbers by next Wednesday. ? Julie ? ?

Eventhough I was out last week, I finished the  following curves:    Canadian CPI Phillippines FX and CPI Mexican FX and CPI Saudi Arabian FX and CPI Guatemalan FX  We also helped London RAC with finding information on the UK inflation model  to backtest it.  Gwyn and Yana kept me very busy last week.  Yana, who lives  close by me was nice enough to drop off work at night.  Gywn and I worked on  the curves over the phone.   Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and  a presentation to give to EGM management.  I gave him a copy of the  conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased.  This week, I'm working  on a urgent request from RAC.  The board has decided to resurrect Dragon 2,  so we are preparing all the curves for the APACHI region.  I'm also working  on the metals presentation.  See you Thursday.   Regards,   Maureen

beck-s	 Mary, Larry and Wes, We just received a faxed copy of the Manual Wire and Same Day Payment memo  which was sent by Betty Tauzier on 8/28/00. Rate & Currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires  next day payments for FX.  Currently we are severely hampered because our  infomation is required into Unify by 2:30 for an Accounts Payable run at 4:00  for next day payments.  We are still trading after these cut-offs and tying  out the day's activity with Trading.  Therefore, we currently have to rely on  manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date.    We need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements.  I would  like to get the Accounts Payable run for our companies, 842 and 967, moved to  after 5:00 pm.  Information is not due to the bank until next day. 8:00 am  London time.

beck-s	 Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:  The following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  Friday, December 15   1.  Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order.       (Richardson's statement and FPA Section 202(c) order is posted on DOE's  Web site at:        http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases00/decpr/pr00309.html )    2.  FERC's 12/15/00 final order to fix California wholesale markets        (FERC's Order can be viewed at  http://www.eei.org/issues/news/cal1215order.pdf)                                    California Supplies Ordered by Richardson  o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00,  unless extended o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO, or FERC will set rate later o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in 1977  As he said he would on December 13, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bill  Richardson found "an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage  of electric energy" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of  the Federal Power Act (FPA) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  California ISO.  In a statement, Richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the California grid requires a long-term solution, but that in  the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts.  The 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the ISO.  The ISO must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 PM,  Eastern Standard Time, the day before the services are needed.  The order  directs the ISO to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power.   The order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 AM, Eastern  Time, December 21, 2000, unless extended.  To continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority, the ISO must re-certify the shortage to DOE  headquarters every 24 hours.  The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the ISO "are to be agreed to by the parties."  If no agreement is reached,  then under the FPA's emergency authority Secretary Richardson "will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable."  The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section 202(c).  The DOE  Organization Act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from FERC to DOE.  The 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the ISO over the last 30 days.  Those entities  are ordered "to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and  transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by  the" ISO, "acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators."    [Source: DOE Secretary Richardson's December 14, 2000 statement and order;  Electric Power Daily, December 15, 2000]                 FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural  Reforms                   A summary of the December 15 Order and Commission Discussion  At its special meeting today, FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting the major  outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the  responsibility for addressing state-related matters, as discussed below.  At  the same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated the November 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances,  California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to California's "seriously flawed" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.  While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus-based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests, each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order.  Chairman  Hoecker and Comm. Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement, while Comms.  Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission  had either "over-reached" or not gone far enough, just as they did on  November 1, as discussed below.  Highlights of key actions:  (1) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to eliminate, effective immediately,  the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules  effective at the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman  Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California  wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning  ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public  Utilities Commission (CPUC).  (2) FERC modified the effective period of the November 1 $150/MWh "soft cap"  proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a  "comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures" must be  in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can  be place by the May 1, deadline.  In a major modification, FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply, unless FERC issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review, refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days.  As proposed, however, supply bids in excess of $150 will be prohibited from  setting the market-clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $150/MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support.  (3) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent, non-stakeholder governing board for the ISO.  The ISO Governing  Board must relinquish their decision-making power and operating control to  the ISO management on January 29, 2001.  A future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process.  (4) In a major modification, FERC adopted a $74/MWh "price benchmark" for  assessing prices of five-year energy supply contracts.  This benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long-term contracts.  To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates, FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants.  (5) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under-scheduling (in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements), in order to discourage over-reliance on the  real-time spot market.  (6) FERC directed the ISO and the three investor-owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards.  (7) FERC affirmed the longer-term measures proposed in the November 1 order,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April 2,  2001.  (8) FERC deferred resolving key issues, including establishing new ISO board  selection procedures, developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection.  (9) FERC reiterated its November 1 call to California policy makers there to  resolve state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand  responses; (3) siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements.  Commissioner Responses  Comm. Hebert reluctantly concurred, calling the final order a "missed  opportunity" to, among other things, send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation.  Reiterating his November 1 concerns,  Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission  should and should not have adopted.  While expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ("balanced and considerate"), the bid certainly reversal, and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board, Hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order, which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low.  Hebert faulted the Commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November 8 order  approving the CA ISO's emergency $250/MWh "soft cap" proposal.  Hebert ended  by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract, including easing the existing prudence review requirements.  Comm. Breathitt endorsed the Order, reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that the Order properly  "walked the line" by taking all of the competing interests into account,  calling it less than ideal, but a step in the right direction.  She also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $74/MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable.  Comm. Massey concurred, but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  California ratepayers, stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised, that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market.  He warned  that, as he understood the legal precedents, the Federal Courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers.  On the positive side, he approved of the de-federalization of  60% of the market and the creation of long term contracts.  However, he  emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission.  In the long term, Comm. Massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like PJM.  Finally, Comm. Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently.  He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on-going investigation.  He also disagreed with the $150/MWh breakpoint,  preferring instead a hard price per generator.  The Commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the West.  Finally,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds.  Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced  to act  and act quickly because the stakes are so high.  He feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act.  He noted that by  shrinking the Cal PX, the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities.  In regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap, the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville, WAPA and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest.   However, he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues.  Finally, in conceptually addressing the California  situation, the Chairman stated that competition or "deregulation" did not  fail in California, but that there never was competition in California. 
beck-s	 I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list.    We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our  list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous  occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think  primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a  lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date.   Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier  a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob  Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.    My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be  re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the  PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the  list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start  and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push  Andrew back as far as possible!    Please let me know if you have any questions -   Sheri

beck-s	 Daren:  During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's  pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and  Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under  contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective  11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934;  Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000.   Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL  Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either  (1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000,  (2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs  approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.

beck-s	 Steve,  Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward.  My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full  picture. Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no control long-term.  I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules for the Research sign-off.  Vince      Steven Leppard 01/24/2001 03:42 AM To: Sharad Agnihotri/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Tani Nath/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT,  Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Research sign off  Hi Sharad  I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to  sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to  do from time to time.  I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what  it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and  therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot  provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I  feel falls firmly within RAC territory.  This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other  groups after all?  To "sign off" means to accept something, which our opinion  in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical  note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving  the formal "sign off" to those best placed to assess these risks for our  company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view  on what is acceptable risk for the company.  Steve

beck-s	 Shona - RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in  understanding the violations.  I recognize and sympathize with the strain  your group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, the  increased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestions  were: 1) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data  gathering process easier, 2) I was offering to "be the bad guy" and point out  to the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen the  effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of  increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their  accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.  I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being "validated" by  the traders as you indicated below, vs. "provided" by the traders as we  envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing  the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back  to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders  should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you  do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track  people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders  responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their  positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able  to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.   Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they  talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you  - whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to  manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and  is still effective from a risk management stand point.  At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to  face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team  players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way  the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and  appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the  policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the  time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.    Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk  about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's  expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have  been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;   and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk  reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on  streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our  respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do  whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what  either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that  Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of  activities related to our risk management systems.

Both students and staff enjoyed our interaction with Enron.  We hope Enron got as much from the project as we did.  I also had some additional thoughts about EnronOnline.  - During the presentation, the students referred to a market's "critical mass".  However, we never defined what we meant by that.  We had several discussions on this topic.  I think the best way for Enron to think about this is in terms of the psychology of traders.  Critical mass gives a market liquidity.  Traders seem to think about liquidity in terms of breadth (how many products are being traded) and depth (the number of bids and offers). Our thoughts were that when a trader pulls up a screen, he (or she) wants to see bids, offers, and trades occurring.  So a simple (and cheap) metric that Enron could use to determine whether rivals are approaching critical mass is simply to pull up screens and see if trades are occurring, and how quickly. Traders will generally not use a trading platform that lacks "action".  - In terms of New Power, I feel it is extremely important that your managers create an identity for the company.  Luckily no rival has done this (though Green Energy is closer than most).  The company that can communicate a simple and powerful message will create a competitive advantage for itself. I believe you can differentiate yourself in this market (though you are selling a commodity).  Since you are essentially selling service, differentiation is always possible.  On a final note, I wanted to ask a favor.  My nephew recently graduate from Michigan State University with a degree in business.  I brought him to Wharton to work on the Tiger Projects.  This was because I knew he could add value, and because I thought he needed more experience in some strategy areas.  He served as project coordinator and worked on several projects (including Enron).  I was hoping I could get him an interview at Enron since he expressed interest in your company.  Any help you could offer is appreciated.  Thanks again for making the experience memorable to the students.  Keith

However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after his class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute "panel discussion" with the students on issues related to real options in practice.l   I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.   I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to hearing from you.   Jim  James S.

beck-s	 Daren: I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from Decemb= er 2000 that has a price issue. =20  We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, Hi= gh Island 138/HPL meter 98663, deal 508426.  The deal was priced at HSC - 0= .14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431= .  It did not start flowing until the 20th.  Danny did not put a new deal i= n for this meter, so we combined the gas on deal 508426.  The Houston Explo= ration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at = HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that=  we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  W= e just don't have the same pricing.  The Houston Exploration shows that we = owe them an additional $222k due to this price difference.  We only purchas= ed this gas in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001.  The deal for Jan, 547063, was priced=  at GD - 0.14.  Can you verify how this deal should be priced?  I sent this=  issue to Danny back in January and he said the IF price was correct, but T= he Houston Exploration is sticking to their price.  If you need to talk to = their trader, his name is Lester Lipperdt 713-830-6960.  Megan

These color copiers are only supported by the Vendor and the lease would be  between your group and the relative Vendor. Response times have been  specified as 4 hr from the time the call is placed to the Vendor Tech  arriving during normal business hours. After hours service is available @  premium rates, yet to be quoted = Let me know if you require this after hours  service pricing.  EPSC Key-Op does not currently support color copier equipment and as such,  someone in your group would receive the necessary training for low level  maintenance {Jams/Toner/Staples etc}. You would also need to store the  necessary supplies for the selected Color Copier.  ******************************************************  Lanier 5706   Website: --> http://www.lanier.com/ps/products/wkgrp/c5706.html  Canon CLC900   Website: --> http://www.usa.canon.com/corpoffice/copiers/clc900.html  Lanier 5710   Website: --> http://www.lanier.com/ps/products/hivol/c5710.html   Canon CLC1150   Website: --> http://www.usa.canon.com/corpoffice/copiers/clc1150.html {We have one of these installed @ 3AC1612}  Canon CLC2400   Website: --> http://www.usa.canon.com/corpoffice/copiers/clc2400.html  Canon CLC1000   Website: --> http://www.usa.canon.com/corpoffice/copiers/clc1000.html {We have some of these installed @ 3AC18 & 3AC09}  Pricing Please see attached winzip file: -->    Thanks,                Iain Russell @ 713-853-6861 Contracts Supervisor Administration Enron Property & Services Corp.

beck-s	 Jeff, here is the information you requested on where we were as of December 11th. Please note this is a snapshot and the situation is very fluid.  Bob Superty    
beck-s	 Sally  I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial= =20 Support model for Enron Japan.=20  My background: In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office= =20 (MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso= n)=20 responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in= =20 Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20 Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I= n=20 Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib= le=20 for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20 related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,= =20 Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &= =20 Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20  Back Office: I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of Enron APACHI). As much a= s=20 possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also= =20 reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f= or=20 this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20 enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only= =20 ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems.    Middle Office:  Mandate What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan= =20 Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 1= 9=20 this year (please find enclosed)  Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck= =20 will look to establish the local risk books in Tokyo and define any=20 system     modifications necessary given the characteristics of the Japanes= e=20 electricity market.  Enron Japan will handle trade capture      and risk=20 management while confirmations and settlements will occur in Houston under= =20 Sally Beck=01,s supervision.  IT support and     system modification will b= e=20 overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston.    Discussion -  Current & Future Situation I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather= =20 is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a= =20 guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil= =20 deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al= so=20 EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this= =20 year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the= =20 very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we mig= ht=20 see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have = a=20 mix of activites from Enron APACHI, Enron Global Markets, EBS and Enron=20 Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.  To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient= ,=20 independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial= =20 Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to= =20 Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is= =20 highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost= s=20 in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and= =20 take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in= =20 place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of bein= g=20 an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired t= o=20 perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there i= s=20 only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from= =20 Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have don= e=20 it this way.  There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commoditi= es=20 are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details,= =20 automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation si= de=20 our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to lat= er=20 stages.  Proposed MO structure for Enron Japan  A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be=20 sourced to Enron Japan, under Enron Japan's CFO.

Learning about Enron's use of leading-edge practices was quite enlightening and I truly benefited from our visit.  Secondly, I've summarized my key "take-aways" as stated below.  Before conveying it to my management, however, I really appreciate it if you can pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss-stated.  Again, thanks so much for your time and wisdom.  I was also honored that you gave me a copy of the "Managing Energy Price Risk" book and shall reference it with interest.  THANK YOU.  I really look forward to seeing you again next time I'm in Houston.  Best regards, Soussan (914) 253-4187  PS.  The latest Fortune article on ENE is a great read and substantiates the company's innovative and creative approach to business. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------ As you may know, I was invited to visit with Enron (ENE) last week.  I met with Vince Kaminski, the VP and head of research in the risk management group of ENE.  Vince who used to be with Salomon Brothers and AT&T is the "brain" of ENE w.r.t. their analytical tools for pricing of commodities, hedging, optimization of financial and physical transactions, as well as the value-at-risk systems.  In addition, Vince has received the 1999 James H. McGraw Award for Energy Risk Management (Energy Risk Manager of the Year) and is well published.  He is the key contributor to a best-selling publication by Risk Books entitled: Managing Energy Price Risk.  Our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re leading-edge practices within ENE.  My key findings are summarized below:  1. ENE does not use corporate price premises.  They use market price info only and adhere to mark-to-market accounting. 2. ENE uses the "Heath, Jarrow, and Morton" methods for modeling price dynamics (I've asked BIC for a copy of the associated paper).  They have their own "home-grown" software, however, they periodically review selected external developments for internal inclusion and advancement. 3. Vince's group comprises of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Operations Researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of ENE's risk management tools.  These models are religiously used by the traders, risk managers, and BUs across ENE. 4. Investment proposals are screened, risked, and "ROVed" by a separate corporate group (similar to our Special Studies and with business and real options skills) who work in conjunction with the BUs.  All evaluations and transactions are marked-to-market. 5. ENE does not use efficient-frontier portfolio concepts.  They "VC fund" any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its own.  They believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market, project-financing in not an issue for a "good" opportunity.  However, they closely monitor the development of each opportunity, within their deep portfolio, at the corporate level and know how to "fail fast". 6. The employee reward system is based on P&Ls as well as the creation of new business. 7. Most employees have stock options.  I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next time I'm in Houston.

beck-s	 Ben and I have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated  support from Houston on our project.  We are wondering what the possibility  is of having either Amitava or Vasant come over for 8 - 12 weeks to help get  things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as  provide some guidance on the CLO part of the business and potentially hiring  an additional  full time resource.

beck-s	 It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality  flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well  as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in  ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your  respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in  the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your  respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an  informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:  Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other  departments Recent successes and current projects Ideas on the horizon Opportunities in your business unit for AA's  The benifits of rotation in your business unit An open Q&A session  These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have  handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them  ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current  AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted  Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a  presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between  12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.  Dave

beck-s	 As we are nearing the deadline for the Book-split project, I want to give you  a status update.  BOOK-SPLIT  Completed Separate Cash & Term books have been setup in Enpower and Global databases  for every country Pablo Pissanetzky has written code to successfully transfer over 99% of the  deals into their proper regional books Two dozen deals (mainly annuities) have been modified in Production to  transfer according to Pablo's code All deals requiring manual intervention on Go Live date have been identified Initial position report has been developed and tested for accuracy  Uncompleted Communication to Commercial of positions (Wed. April 26) Presentation of the Position Report which allows Commercial to view monthly  peak/off-peak volumes by region (Wed. April 26) PCS by deal for each portfolio Separate DPRs and associated reports for the Pool and Bilateral portfolios Modifications necessary for the Settlements invoicing system   TRANSMISSION  We are making progress on this effort although you have not seen any hard  evidence.  Zhiyong Wei is the IT Director in Houston who is responsible for  Enpower development.  We are working with Pablo and Zhiyong on several  possibilities.  As we have previously discussed, there is not the current  capability to value the spreads as options, but we are testing the other  scenarios.   Buy/Resale This deal type has been disabled We are waiting for Zhiyong's response as to its future functionality if any  Transmission Pablo tested in the Stage environment today after receiving minor assistance  from Zhiyong Ability to book Transmission deal without Annuity leg Ability to liquidate demand charge daily Reflects long and short positions at the appropriate regions (as Forwards not  Options) Does not value the forward spread between the regional curves (still testing) Variable cost treatment is still being tested  Forwards If deep in the money, we could enter intra-desk/inter-desk deals to reflect  positions and P&L   Much time and IT development resources have been spent to make use of the  Transmission functionality.  After speaking with Zhiyong, there evidently was  a big push last year for the MTM of Transmission.  The latest version has  been in the test environment for some time, but no one is currently testing  it.  It will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complete  by the book-split deadline.  As we established in our last meeting, the MTM of transmission is a separate  project from the book-split.  Due to the complexity and amount of data  involved in the book-split project itself, it is advisable that we  incorporate the transmission second.  Further testing of the transmission  will continue this week and by the end of the week we should have a decision  on the most effective way to currently book transmission.    Please call or come by if you have any questions, Todd Hall

beck-s	 Amy,  I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a  reasonable decision.  We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain  clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a  rather vague concept of what they want to accomplish.  Vince     To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: MIT/AA Lab- next meeting  Vince: Can you shed any light on this? I'm confused (really confused)....  Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only  by Kean, Buy and Koening? And Do you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs? Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and  start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the  Lab.  From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole  thing, Rick's issue of "where AA is going with this" is really a mute point,  isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort.  Would appreciate your insight and advice. Thanks.

beck-s	 I set up the simulation model.  The margin follows a mean-reverting process.  I seperarted the data into two category, margin >0.04  and margin <0.04. Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets. I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data  set.  The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side. Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run  a few senarios.  I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium  calculation, so the the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal  pricing. I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar  worth.  Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread  option approach that Bob and Lee set up.    Look like we got a reasonable model.    Stinson: I'd like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.  Lee and Douglas: You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.  Bob: We need  run different price curve senarios using the simulation model.    plus different MR speed.    Zimin

One is as a financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects of the mobile Internet (read 3G).  On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding  (a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the ground.  (b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting, asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining.  (c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials, credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets Enron has been moving into over the last few years.  On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.  I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the room would be very important to me.  As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27, May 3/4 are good for me.

beck-s	 On Saturday I came to work and did some things that I needed to do. Also, there were some things  left undone that  I felt I should do.   Mainly the conference room - We will schedule all birthday's and meetings in  the large conference room therefore , I made the room look more spacious.  Also on Monday - we need to check with the painters too see if they are going  to repair our walls.  We also need to get the additional pictures from the cage and get  them placed on the wall whereby the move can be completed.  If either of you have any questions or know of more things to do please let's get together and discuss.

beck-s	 Shona  We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their  Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally  received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was  placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about  an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the "hot list" but we were  told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the  MPR.  Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called  Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned  this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau  Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too.  A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure  policies regarding the MPR.  Please let me know if I can provide any  additional information.

beck-s	 Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with  various government officials.  I hope the result was good.  We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I  just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on  Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited  about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit  with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that  this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.    We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin  with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our  automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all  Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no  need to keep hard copies in Mexico.  Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or  should be more involved.

beck-s	 The Enron BOD approved the some limit changes today, effective for trading= =20 day Tuesday, February 13, 2001, consistent with the risk management policy'= s=20 intent to provide a trading limit framework whereby management can review= =20 Enron's consolidated exposure to commodities.  To faciliate the aggregation= =20 and reporting of Enron's consolidated exposure to commodities, the limit=20 structure was modified to provide for aggregation of North American Natural= =20 Gas and Electricity, with EES's NA Gas and Power positions included, and wi= th=20 a separate business unit sub-limit for EES.  Policy amendments were as follows:  u Clarify the cross-commodity trading policy to specify that trading limits= =20 are to be applied against Enron=01,s consolidated commodity positions on an= =20 individual commodity group basis;  Enron=01,s consolidated Daily Position R= eport=20 should provide required market risk disclosures by primary commodity group;= =20 (for example, Enron=01,s exposure to the North American Natural Gas market = shall=20 be aggregated across the company).  =01) Delegate cross-commodity trading approval among established commodity= =20 groups to the respective Business Units Offices of the Chairman, with=20 appropriate reporting to the Enron Corp.

Steve:  I'll see if I can get in on the 25th . . . will let you know, but I think it'll work.  Just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested, Abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world (89 million US households, 3 billion+ purchases), along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level. Given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is--improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)  Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and "new entrants" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we have some tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs.  I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, but I guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enron might have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly) listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.  Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you.

beck-s	 You asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the Analyst PRC  process...  I thought I would share a few things with you.  The primary  concern was that an individual was representing "our" people, and they 1) did  not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately  answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job  responsibilities.  Although I think the manager's in my group did an  excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts  rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy  about someone independent of our group representing them.    Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages  about the "third" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying  with the company, etc.  I think a good idea would be to provide some clear,  written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going  to work going forward.  It surer seems like it changes every 6 months...    Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sheri 
beck-s	 TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and  $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please  change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.  Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They  have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El  Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has  the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called  "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is  $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

I've also adjusted the spreadsheet  based on our conversation yesterday.  Take a look at it when you get a chance.  D

beck-s	  Rohm & Haas has been added and the sale for Union Carbide for April has been added.    
beck-s	 We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.  Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.  ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.  CORPORATE STAFF   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20 Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In= =20 that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and= =20 Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an= d=20 Chief of Staff.  COMMITTEE STRUCTURE   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s= =20 growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20 business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to= =20 be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a= nd=20 the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20 drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20 performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. = =20 The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.   We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit= tee. =20 This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20 management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20 Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.   We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital = to=20 our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20 supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

When this happens &  scheduling doesn't catch to override the zero, the desk's expense is  understated. This is causing a huge mess for Texas Operations.

I've got some suggestions  below and would like to hear any that you have:  In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the  betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control  responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model  is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons  for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are  to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.    Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to  upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give  feedback before hand.    Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we  go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.  Thanks,  Fred 5-9323

beck-s	 Julie:  I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and have not been using it.    Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate  (when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case,  we probably need a refund.  Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this.  The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else.  Thanks!  Shirley       From: Julie Pechersky/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/09/2001 12:33 PM To: Shirley Crenshaw/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: RE: Various Market Data Charges to the Research Group for February  2001  Hi Shirley,  Regarding Telerate:  I can cancel the service for both Maurenn and Tanya,  but another name commonly used for the Telerate application is Bridge or  Bridgestation so you may want to just ask the two of them once more to be  sure that they do not use it.  Just let me know and I will cancel billing  Jason can get access to it by submitting an e-request for him for Telerate.   When you go into E-request and it is prompting you for what application to  choose, type in the words Market Data and hit Search.  Telerate will pop up  as an option and within that choose the role Basic Energy.  We will take care  of it from there.  I will also remove Hector Campos from Reuters.  Was there anyone else being  charged for Reuters services that are not needed?  I will also remove Clayton Vernon.  I do not see anything under the name Brad  Amoine, is this the correct spelling of his name?  I will also find out where Shalesh's charges should be moved to.  Thanks for updating us and let me know if there is anything else.

I've copied this to Julie Pechersky, who maintains the Market  Data database, and will be able to make the user changes you request.  She'll  also be able to tell you how / when Telerate can be enabled for Mr. Sokolov.  We get the billing data from her, so once it is correct there, it will be  billed correctly.  Cliff Jackson   -----Original Message----- From:  Crenshaw, Shirley   Sent: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 1:31 PM To: Jackson, Clifford Cc: Kaminski, Vince Subject: Various Market Data Charges to the Research Group for February 2001  Clifford:  In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043, I have several questions.  Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35) I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.  The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason  Sokolov, unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate. Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is for Jason Sokolov.  Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96) No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for  Hector  Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the  Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for  it.  Please  remove from the Research Cost Center.  The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.  Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL  and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core  charges from the Research Cost Center Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core  charges from the Research Cost Center  I hope this is not too confusing!   Please advise.  Thanks!  Shirley Crenshaw        
beck-s	 Folks,  I am a Vice President with Enron, and have been with the company some 6 years  now.  I was hired through Enron Associate pool, and started off by marketing  power on the East Coast with Jim Fallon.  Currently I am working in the India  Region, looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in  India, anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future.   One of my challenges is to make the team in India aware of the type of  sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading  activities, as well as the range of products we have to offer.  I have been in conversation with Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman on the  Global Products side, and are planning a session to acquaint the team in  India with activities in that group.  Similarly, on the power side, we have  been interacting with John Sherriff's team in London.   I feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get  acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in Houston, and to  get an idea of the RAC process, the Research side, the Back-offices, as well  as the trading operations here.  Similarly, the team there could present to  you the state of the market in India, and give you an idea of the type of  opportunities there.  I am therefore eliciting your support to put together a  session in Houston where they can be acquainted with these functions, as well  as the people responsible for them in the US.  There are three people in the  group who would benefit from this exposure.  One of them is from the  Associate pool, while the other two are people hired locally in India.   I have already spoken with our COO, Wade Cline in this regard, and seek your  support in putting together an agenda for such a session.  Please let me know  who I should contact within your groups to discuss this further.  Regards, Sandeep.

Is there someone else at Enron whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?  I have attached the program agenda for your review.

Please let me know if there is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or others that may be of interest to Enron.  I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy surrounding the situation in San Diego.

beck-s	 Good afternoon ladies,  I am working with Vince Kaminski, Director of Research, Enron Corp. and John  Martin, Chair of Finance at Baylor University to schedule one hour time slots  with Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow.    Vince and John Martin are jointly authoring a 20-40 page paper, written in  the style of a Harvard Business Review piece, about 'Transforming Enron  Corporation as an Act of Managerial Will - The Value of Active Management'.   Attached below you will find a brief outline of the proposed case study,  although I have requested John Martin to provide us with the specific  questions he will be asking all three participants.  We would like to schedule the one hour interviews on the following dates:  Monday, December 4th  Tuesday, December 5th  Week of December 11th   Please let me know at your earliest convenience which of the above-mentioned  dates/times works best with everyone's calendar.  Thanks a million.  
beck-s	 Saturday:  Mark from Aquilla was short 5000 into the Valero Hub and it appeared that  PG&E may have to cut Aquilla's delivery into us, but Mark was able to get the  5000 he needed to make the delivery. Transco Bammel had some Unit testing by Transco preventing flow until 9 PM.   I got with Robert A. From the East desk and he decided to go ahead and cut  the nom down to 30 for Saturday's gas day.  I changed the confirm in Pops to  reflect it. Changed confirm for Midcon Hardy to show the correct 20,000. Changed the confirm for Flaggstaff to show the correct 0. Communicated with Reggie from Dynegy to get 4,000 at Transco Markham for  Saturday's gas day confirmed with Transco.  It was finally confirmed later  that night.  Sunday  At 6:00 the flow into Valero Riverside was 0'd out and changed to Valero  T'Ville for the remainder of the gas day.  Gas Control said to do it  verbally.  I could not get a hold of any scheduler with PG&E to see the  contractual impact.  I let Ed Gottlob know and he said to just let it flow.  
beck-s	 That's great.  What about deal 452475?  We have $0.10 and we are being billed  $0.11 for meter 25000200 on contract 1856.  Also, I faxed the Oct 2000 TXU  invoices to Trisha Hughes so she can look into the Dec 2000 and forward  problem.  Megan 
beck-s	 Effective July1, 2000, I will be the new point of contact at Enron North  America for Devon.  In an effort to avoid duplication of e-mails to every scheduler on every desk, I would like  to forward the volumes, revisions or any other pertinent information to only the people who need it.   Could  you please send me a list of the schedulers who handle Devon on each of your desks and the pipes they schedule?  I will  also forward a copy of any changes to  a point person on each desk that will follow up with the schedulers to make  sure they make appropriate revisions.

beck-s	 Hello Vince, Stinson,  Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very informative.  As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program in place and rolling, and start the students working on it. It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.  If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August, to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe, who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest to Enron.  The plan is this:  1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem space.  2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of good problems of: a) high practical importance b) high innovation potential c) serious scope.  3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to: a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy and execution path.  I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his doctoral work in this area.  I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these research issues!  Talk to you soon.

beck-s	 As a continuation of the integration of Enron Metals into Enron Europe we are  pleased to announce the following organisational changes which become  effective immediately.  Tom McKeever, presently Chairman of Enron Metals will move into the role of  Vice Chairman Enron Europe reporting directly to John Sherriff and Michael  Brown.  Tom will focus on developing our key senior business relationships  across all of Enron Europe.  Joe Gold will become President of Enron Metals responsible for the entire  organization.  We will announce Joe's replacement for managing our trading  and origination efforts on the Continent in the near future.  Michael Farmer and Michael Hutchinson will continue in their roles managing  the Metals's Merchanting and Financial Trading businesses respectively.  Please join us in congratulating Tom and Joe on their new roles.  From the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman 
beck-s	 To help avoid Unify problems during bid-week we must be keeping up with the  business on the non-EDI pipes throughout the month rather than wait until the  end of the month to clean-up and bridge back. The IT staff has identified  this as one of the things Logistics could do to help them maintain reasonable  performance.   Please make sure you know the status of each of your pipes and speak to the  schedulers if you see they aren't keeping their data clean and bridged. I  expect you to keep on top of this throughout each month.  We are asking everyone else to work around our schedule so lets make sure we  do our part.  Thanks - Bob

beck-s	 Darren I called this afternoon but you were out. I hope all is well with you with respect to the recent events. Would you please call me regarding the following two matters.  1) I am looking for a contact name and number for the person at Enron that can help us get a GISB agreement in place. Our company went through a large bank financing and we are going to be conducting commercial operations under the entity known as ANP Funding I, LLC. Therefore, we would like to set up a GISB agreement between Enron and ANP Funding I, LLC. Becky Kalmick works with me and she is responsible for executing the GISB agreement. Would you please let me know who we can speak with regarding the agreement. Also, would you please give your contact heads up as to what we want to do. Please note that I am dealing with Mary Cook in your company regarding the execution of an ISDA agreement.  Becky Kalmick Work
beck-s	 Kevin-  I need to apologize to you for speaking out-of-turn yesterday about  work-in-progress. Any model our group has of the natural gas system remains  completely untested and unvalidated. I have not been asked by any one of my  superiors, Vasant or Wince, to give advice to anyone at Enron concerning  natural gas; I am not an expert in trading natural gas. My work exists within  a large and professional group, and, to the point, Vince alone will decide  when, and if, any gas model is suitable for dissemination within Enron.  Sincerely,  Clayton Vernon Manager, Research 
beck-s	 Bob Shults is scheduled to be in Atlanta, GA on the 17th of March and would  like to reschedule the "customer profiling meeting", to Friday, March 24th at  1:30 p.m., location to be announced.  If you are unable to attend please let  me know.  Lydia 3-9975 
beck-s	 We have established a set of power volatility curves down to the EFA/monthly  level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out.  Beyond this,  the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long-term level for  power volatility, given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices  over large time-scales.  The swaption traders can now fit the first 5-6 years of the volatility curve  to the market-observed baseload swaption implied volatilities (typically 3 to  12 months duration for the underlying swap) and then be in a good position to  price other swaptions (including swaptions on individual EFA slots)  consistent with the curve.  There may also be an impact on the daily VaR  calculation.  An illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below:-     These curves will be reset as the market moves, and allow a mark-to-market  approach to be followed for our volatility book.  The spreadsheet model is  saved in T:\READWRTE\ELEC_UK\MODELS\VOLCURVEGENERATORNEW.XLS and also  attached below for Houston staff to review.     [Stinson - I'd be grateful if you could offer an opinion/audit to ensure that  I haven't missed anything, thanks.]  Regards,  Anjam  x35383

Thanks.

These issues have been  addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need  to be completed by June 19, 2000.   1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to  reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee  and NGPL and also for Tejas.                               2) Tetco Meter 6892 -  Question of who has custody transfer at the meter.   ENA is using Tetco's  volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume,  causing a desk to desk variance.                                             Clem and Pat are working on.  3) Transco Bammel  Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of  balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve.  4) Dow  Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter  4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486.                                             A desk to desk between ENA (buyer)  and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486.                                           Ami needs to set up the deals and  Thu needs to coordinate the months involved.                                            Once this is done and Thu  reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and  make the meter non allocatable in Pops.                                           Clem verified with Steve Schneider  that this meter is not on HPL's system.  5) East Texas Gas / Devon     - Devon invoicing ENA entire flow at Carthage.      Meter 4607701                           East Texas keeping HPLC whole on  nominations                                                              Desk to desk  deal is out of balance because of this                                                               Karen is working  with Pennzoil and East Texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue  between them             6) PGEV -  Actuals on swing meters (HPL ) not matching expense volumes being  allocated by PGEV.                       Sherlyn is working with Stacey and Charlotte to resolve.  7) Pan Energy Sales issues - discrepancies on PGEV.  Katherine and Sherlyn  are working with Stacey  to resolve.

beck-s	 I'm not sure how or if you're planning on distributing to the business unit  controllers or other ops people the updated Risk Management Policy, but I'm  attaching a version without the limit amounts as this is what we use to  distribute to people outside our group (of course we tell traders their own  specific limits, and the top guys can see the consolidated DPR, but for  everyone else we provide it without limits).  I did send it to Wanda Curry  and Barry Pearce, but I'm not sending it to anyone in your org chart unless  you'd like me to.  I'd like to get this out on the RAC website, but since  it's a work in progress, I think it might be a while.   Regards, Cassandra. 
beck-s	 As a speaker at EPRM's highly successful Power 2000 event in  Houston, I am  writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce  myself. I  will be responsible for the production of all North American EPRM  events  having moved from our banking conference and training course division in   July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is   developing our technology events for Waters conferences and Joel Hanley will  be  starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.  EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th  of May and I am  keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend  to call  each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like  to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some   issues.  What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference   seminars at EPRM 2001?  What research are you or your company involved in that would justify   inclusion in EPRM 2001?  Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of  energy risk management?  Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker?

beck-s	 Dear Ken, Leslie,  It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it  was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but  they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a  result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in  the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to  draft a rewrite of these areas.    Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before  we share the information with Portland.  Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?  Thanks  Shona

Also do you have any analyses on Chase that might help me  detect other  opportunities?  Is there anyone on your staff with whom I should talk?  Thanks  Chris

Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both  CDS valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the  reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating CDS quotes,  they propose minimising an error measure based on 'smoothness' of def prob  curve and difference between model and market prices.   What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in  Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus  one excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no  reason why we shouldn't have similar work published ourselves.

beck-s	 I will see you on Friday at 3.  If you would like for me to come before then,  just let me know.   -----Original Message----- From:  Kaminski, Vince   Sent: Wednesday, May 02, 2001 3:01 PM To: Labbe, Anne Cc: Kaminski, Vince Subject: Re: Gwen Koepke  Anne,  Thanks for contacting me about this. As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it  today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.  I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).    On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client  for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor  or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal  customer will be quite a challenge. Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget.  I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

I have tried to contact Maureen so that  Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but  have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I  hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I  just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.    Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through  Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your  expectations during PRC.  Thanks, Anne

We constantly strive to improve the marketing of our events and therefore we ask our speakers for further ideas and contacts. Therefore please could you let me know whether you could help with any of the following.  Are there any particular people that you need to send brochures to? - we can carry out any mailing on your behalf if you supply us with contact names and addresses, alternatively I can send you a quantity of brochures  Do you have any in-house publications or a newsletter that we should insert the course brochure into - or a diary date page that we could be included on?  Would you like to write to your clients to invite them to attend? We can offer them a 10% discount and can send them a letter or if you prefer to write on your own letterhead we will organise the copying and distribution for you.  Have you any delegate lists from events you have spoken at or attended with a similar target audience to whom we should be sending information about the course?  Do you have an internet site on which the course could be mentioned?  Do you have any other ideas? Any suggestions would be welcome.  Our marketing manager, Caroline Hyndman will contact you in the near future to discuss any ideas you may have. Alternatively please give me a call on 212 925 1864 Ext 151.  Thanks very much for your help in this matter.  Best regards,  Emma

beck-s	 The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major  system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before  Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time  SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the  cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.  As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for  netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.   This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the  payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of  September.    However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure  works.  To ensure we don't "accidentally" release cash, I have asked Unify IT  to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which  will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but is  worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday,  9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Bryce

You have been recommended to me in the course of my  research as an authority  in this field so I would be delighted for you to  present any of the sections  that are still available on the attached  programme:  For London: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4 and   For New York: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 and 8  My market research indicates that advanced stress  testing is a highly  interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative  analysts and risk  managers. I anticipate the course to be technical and  practical in nature  and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates. It  aims to extend  the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity  and credit  risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new  risk  measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated  context. ? Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section  is  most suitable for your current interests.

beck-s	 I just wanted to give all of you an update to my previous message on the  replacement for Brian Heinrich in Financial Operations.  Jennifer Blay was  going to be his replacement; however, Jennifer has accepted a position in  Energy Operations working for Jeff Sorenson.

In addition, Sarah  Brown will transfer as Manager of the Consolidated Reporting Team from the  Gas and Transmission Assets Team in the Business Analysis and Reporting  organization.

beck-s	 Chris,  I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.  1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation  equation and the way it's typically discretized.  2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain  what CT is (perhaps a footnote).   I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.  ****************************************************************************** ***************  1.

beck-s	 Melissa/Darren   Global Contract #96045720   Cokinos/Tri-C has elected to price their production for the month of April  2001 as follows:  4,000/d, 97% IF/HSC all production in excess of 4,000/d priced 97% Gas Daily   Thank you,  Michael 
beck-s	 Rick,  Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support  function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we  already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.  The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley. 
beck-s	 Discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a  change to the legal entity we'll use for the "trading" portion of  Clickpaper.com activity.    As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is...... a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.   Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees. b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.  1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by  Clickpaper.com, Enron North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the         confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement  for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as  a         "Clickpaper.com on-line transaction".     2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin  America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My  desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line  trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.  Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most  significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support  Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting  up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the  same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions  between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which  simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial  reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using  Clickpaper.com as the entity.    If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At  that point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!  For now,  Jeff Harbert

beck-s	 Sally, FYI - We've had many complaints and I've had many discussions today  with Dave N. and Inja. They did discover some system board that is going to  be replaced tonight. Hopefully replacing the board will do it but history  makes me skeptical that this is the sole cause for the slow performance.  Needless to say we had to get Settlements and Volume Management to stop their  work and we still didn't see any improvement. I know everyone is just as  frustrated as Logistics. At our last several meetings to discuss this problem  I was insistent that unless they have an answer it seems to me, and the rest  of the staff, that the system just cannot support the real heavy demand that  first of month noms and the monthly close require.   I've included an email I received from Kathy Kelly if you want some gory  detail.

beck-s	 I haven't checked with all of my Managers, but I know at least some of them  sent you their Satisfactory reviews and had not heard anything back from you  by 7/31 which I think was the original deadline for completing reviews.   And  I know that although I received feedback from you on my Needs Improvement  employees, I didn't receive any formal feedback on my Satisfactory employees  reporting directly to me.  I believe I recall a phone conversation that we  had where you told me to go ahead and give the Satisfactory reviews.  At that  point, I told all of my Managers to proceed with completing the reviews on  their Satisfactory employees.  I believe that all of my department's reviews  have been executed and turned in - save one for an Analyst as I am still  waiting to hear feedback from his PRC rep.    So, based on your explanation  of AnneMarie's memo, I guess I would like clarification.  Are any of the 51  in my department?  Because, it could be that we went ahead and gave them when  we were trying to get everything wrapped up in early August and be as timely  as possible in giving constructive feedback to our employees based on our  phone conversation - and that you're still waiting for us to provide them to  you for review.  What I mean by it is ridiculous to wait so long to  communicate performance feedback is : September?    Sorry for any confusion.  Don't take things so personally - I'm venting at  the process, not the people.

beck-s	 Hi, I have run the VaR for COB 1st Aug 2000. A summary of the results is as  follows :     I have also attached the model.  Again the prices for Cocoa Beans and Gold have not been updated since the  26th July. The gamma positions for the metals have been  added to check the effect on the VaR. The change  was small : Delta VaR - $4,899,196 Delta/Gamma VaR - $4,780,797 This is not a live daily feed as Andreas mannually created the file for me  today so that we could do this check.

beck-s	 Vince and Stinson,  Alex and I attended the International Chinese Petroleum and Petrocehmical  Technology conference in Houston.  We presented two talks 1) Risk management in petroleum industry  and 2) Real option valuation of oil field.  The section chairman said our talks were the high  moments in the business session.   There were several interesting talks in the business section.  I am going to  get a copy of the presentation on Internet opportunity in energy trading, where the author did a study about  all energy trading sites including EnronOnLine.  A talk from a gentleman working for Costal (used to be pal of  Song Yip) on real  assets management is also very informative.  A talk about using real option  theory for IT managenet was also interesting.  Big players, ExxonMobil, Shell, Taxco, and BP have strong presence in the  conference.  I made a copy for you of the keynote speech by Bob Gee, the Assistant Energy  Secretary under Clinton Administration about the energy outlook.    Zimin

beck-s	 Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although  obviously it's you.   We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining  Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations.  Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim  Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going  day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.  Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever  expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in  place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location.  Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations  will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this  role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group  to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back  office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract  Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group  will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the  timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key  operational procedures and processes are implemented.     Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur  Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral  part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe.  He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading  Support Operations.   Please join us in wishing Barry  success in his new role. 
beck-s	 I trust things are well in Houston.  The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the  week commencing Monday 18th September.   I and several of my colleagues would very much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference between Tuesday through to Friday of that week.  Is there any chance in meeting with you on Monday 18th?  If so, I will brief  you more fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.

beck-s	 Vince,  Please find below a note I had prepared for Wade Cline who is meeting with a  representative of the Prime Minister's office tomorrow.  I think you may find these points useful.  Additionally, I am attaching a copy of a small presentation I made, Saturday  in Mumbai on roadblocks in the power sector with special reference to wat  needs to be done to start Trading (& its benefits).  I have been working with the Henwood team that arrived today, and I think a  good part of the data is now in place.  I will be arranging meeting with some  officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there  too.  Krishan got in last night (I conveyed your best wishes to him).  We will  hopefully have a useful day with Henwood folks tomorrow.  I look forward to  being in Houston, possibly by the end of the coming week.  Hope you and the team are doing well!!  Regards, Sandeep.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  01/15/2001 01:17 AM ---------------------------   Sandeep Kohli 01/15/2001 01:17 AM To: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:   Subject: Points for Singh Meet  Wade,  Please find below a brief note on what I feel your tack should be with  N.K.Singh (who is supposed to be a hard negotiator).  I am assuming here that  this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out  the other.  The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend, would  hopefully, have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two  people o the issue.  Incidentally, in the Indian system, the Governor of any state is a Central  government nominee.  He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt. in the  state.  Please see Basak's meeting in that light.  The message he takes will  likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi.  I will therefore be working closely  to convey the right impression.  For N.K.Singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey: A description of the problem,  Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough, and Conveying the fact that there are win-win solutions well within the GoI's  power to implement, that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  country's as one that lives up to its reputation  I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any  value, but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB, GoM, and GoI needs, either  through financial re-engineering, or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas.  This will also fly well with Enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political.  Describing the Problem  DPC has a PPA, backed by GoI & GoM guarantees for one of the most high  profile projects in the world  (World's largest gas fired power plant, India's first LNG terminal, gateway  to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India, development of  Konkan) With coming of Phase II (due end-2001) cost of power from Dabhol will be more  competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant  (low heat rates, larger turbines, spreading of infrastructure costs over a  larger base, use of LNG as fuel) (Our average tariff at 90% despatch is Rs. 4.02/kWh for Phase I.  This goes  down to Rs. 3.30 - 3.70/kWh with coming in of Phase II.  Compare this with  NTPC's own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs.3.32 - 4.01for same range  of crude prices ($21-28/barrel).  Hence DPC power is competitive, our  standards of performance are higher, penalties for non-performance are  greater, and as a private player, our place in the waterfall seems to be  lower (quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by 45-60  days, MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments). However, monthly outflows could be as much as Rs. 450 Cr./month; MSEB's  monthy collections not improving - are in the range of Rs. 900 Cr./month   MSEB, and GoM clearly do not have the resources, in the short run (3-5 yrs.)  to meet these obligations; hence Central intervention is needed. In a grid of 13000 MW (Maharashtra grid size), absorbing an additional 1440  MW (Phase II) at one go is difficult; however if we take Western Region, grid  size is 42000 MW.  Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier.   To this if we add Northern and Southern grids, we can probably evacuate out  another 500-700 MW through the interconnects.  Hence, there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level. Additionally, it is not just solvable at that level, but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country, and hence is a boon for the govt.,  and should be treated as such.  Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee, which will cover our partial  payments.  However, this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country's credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  Petroleum sector (where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 O&G blocks), telecom sector (where a new policy has been announced  months ago, and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing). It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks,  including export credit agencies of US, Japan, and Belgium (an EEC member). It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks (Indian lenders to  the project include IDBI, ICICI, SBI, to metion just a few) Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector, where there  is urgent need for funding (especially te new initiatives in transmission) There is a timeline for solving this, since our project is coming before  year-end 2001, and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take  place at the SEB and state level.   Win-Win Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved, south needs power badly.  Hence it is a  boon to have this power made available in the timeframe.  With Central govt.  intevention, it is possible to solve th problem to everyone's mutual benefit. 1440 MW (incremental Phase II) is only 3.4% of the capacity existing in the  Western Region, and can be easily absorbed. Win-Win Solutions exist by: Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity (including those from the petroleum sector -  IOC or GAIL, interested due to LNG trml.) to the equity mix at par Back-ending tariff and other financial re-engineering solutions that could  involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt. et. etc.  Bottom Line:  Time is of essence; we need to get someone to negotiate with.  Please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  Central, State govt., and SEB representatives so that we can work on the  solution. Without active participation from PM's office, we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the SEB, GoM, and various Ministries of GoI.  Hope this helps.  Regards, Sandeep. 
beck-s	 Daren, I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you  are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to. For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set  up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.   The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal  was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using  is Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032  ).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.

beck-s	 FYI  This is a reduction in total capacity from 528,000 to 400,000 at Station 809.  HPL has typically been running about 180,000 to 200,000 mmbtu through Station  809 in August.  We can pull more gas off of the A-S line at Swan Lake to keep  our throughput around the 175,000.    My original conversation with EPFS was that the capacity would be limited to  around 400,000 mmbtu total during the maintenance.  Station 809 will be down  through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move  without 809 running.  I will visit with EPFS on Monday and see if we can get  the volume bumped up (to 400,000) and adjust on Tuesday as necessary.  If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Some of you are leaving early so we are taping you from 11-12 Friday morning while others are being taped after the program is over.  I'm sure I've forgotten something so you'll probably get more e-mails. However, this should take care of the primary stuff.  I'm really looking forward to seeing all of you and to hearing your thoughts in the workshops.  more later,  john    - Schedule_map.doc  John D. Martin Carr P.

Phillip Randle Desktop Support Specialist x39665    -----Original Message----- From:  Kaminski, Vince   Sent: Tuesday, May 01, 2001 5:17 PM To: Randle, Phillip C. Cc: Kaminski, Vince Subject: Installation of new programs  Phillip,  How can I install new programs on my laptop, without  the administrator's privileges?  One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow  me to install it.   Also, I have my private statistical software I often use when I work at night during business trips. I would like to load it as well.  Vince 
beck-s	 Ted,  Question 1)  The investments in CALME and APACHI are booked on an accrual  basis.  I have had several meetings with Commercial and Accounting    representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are  effectively reinvested back into the Assets.  Therefore, the   Market Values  that are reflected on the MPR are actually Book Values.  The Book Values are  typically adjusted the last week of the month   and are 1 month behind as the  Internation groups wait until the GL is closed before communicating the  updated values.  Question 2)  Thanks for the heads-up on India.  I spoke with Sheila Glover  and we are now aware of the details behind Rediff.com.  We need to ensure    that these positions are not accounted for on the DPR by India so that we do  not double-report the P&L.  The long-term solution is to   establish a  communication line for future investments.  Between Sheila, Donna Lowry, and  I we can develop a plan.    Question 3)  The 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by Jeff  Kinneman for Jim Easter.  During our last conversation, Jim told Jeff that  these   are Strategic investments and should not be reflected on the MPR.   There is still some uncertainty/confusion as to when an investment is  classified as Merchant.  We could insist that all publically traded  investments not included in the Equity books would qualify.  Having said  that, I would like to know if the Gas Authority of India, Ltd (GAIL) and  Europe's investment in MG are considered to be Merchant investments.  I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week so please include  David Maxwell on any responses.  David and I will stay in touch so as to make  adjustments as needed.  Thanks, Todd         From:  Ted Murphy                                                              06/22/2000 03:07 PM

beck-s	 For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal  (Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as  Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.   Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and  I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do  you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the  Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.  For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and  16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June  13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than  planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.  For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing  reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know  Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk  to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.  Let me know if you have questions.

Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy  2) completeness and 3) coverage  of the areas we want to explore.  As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil  reserves are 1,000 billion bbls.  Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would  add only 0.1 %.  While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not  looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time  frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.

beck-s	 Hi Vince, I was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the  full mailing list. Basically it suggests that the  copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000.  However, given that the portfoilo has also  changed from the 1st of August it is difficult to asses the actual change due  to the option only.

beck-s	 John:  Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed  jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and  semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a  simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.   The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual  jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a  poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we  noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3.  You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis).   Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,  12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.  We will forward the results as soon as we finish.     Please call me or Claudio if you have questions. Paulo Issler 
beck-s	 Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created  and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.  Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system  (which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would  create).  Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no  meters, so they are not set up.    The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I  need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is  this the same point???  Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.   Thanks, Faye

Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps.  The structure of this particular swap is:    semi/semi Act/365F > > YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2 > p = payment month > The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will  notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as  opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).  Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by  swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.    Looking forward to your comments.  Best regards,  Martina x34327

beck-s	 The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures  in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of  events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include  customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.    ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this  memo.  The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the  threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to  $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and  events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.  1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer  events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events  with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public  Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman  2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract  negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department  will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they  can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department  will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program  and ENA.  3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting  documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a  detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please  submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR  department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the  form.  4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of  the Chairman for final approval.  Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for  various local sporting events and concerts.  If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance  planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie  Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.  Thank you for your cooperation.

beck-s	 After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few  discrepancies with the Tufco volumes.        HPL   PG&E  5/8   137.500   139.583  5/11   103.750   100.833  5/19   108.333   8.333  Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19  discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that  it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what  flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and  corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this  decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL  4.649.

beck-s	 David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the  problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will  investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity  should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense  to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less  transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be  systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the  responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince

beck-s	 Daren,  The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any  activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the  flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to  put in a deal for this flow?    Thanks.  Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have  adequate flow into Stratton. 
beck-s	 Vince,  I shipped you the paper along with my note to Don.  However, I wanted to share with you what I feel are the remaining "to dos".  Specifically,  1.  We need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original transformation of Enron.  Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.  2.  We need to complete/beef up the network strategy section.  3.  Finally, the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to "hammer home" the basic principles underlying the transformation.  What do you think?  Hope you have a great weekend.  John  John D. Martin Carr P.

I fully understand.  The only glitch is that I will be in Europe next week, leaving this Friday and coming back next Sunday. I'm visiting several companies and universities. Is it an option for you to schedule your visit to Stanford the first week of November, so that we can get together and talk about the research program etc. ?  On another matter now. I have been in contact with Stinson regarding the program funds. I am under great pressure from my Department to finalize Giuseppe's RAship and I am way beyond the deadline. I understand that Paul Racicot will fund the project and Stinson is doing anything he can to make this happen.  May I solicit your help and intervention to Paul to have the process expedited? I look bad to my colleagues here for not honoring my commitments to the students I had promised to support and the pressure on me is mounting exponentially!

beck-s	 Dr. Kaminski, I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May, but not from monday, probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed). Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4 I am sorry.  And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business, organized by my advisor Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups interested in e-business and especially procurement? The link is as following. http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/  I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email... My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu) wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him during the summer, while I am staying there. His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?) and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace... XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk .. system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system, e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc... many technical aspects of e-business... He wants to do some kind of technical case study that is beneficial for both ENRON and him. He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the summer. (And to be frankly, this will be good for me too, because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..) Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?  Thank you..  Sincerely, Jinbaek   - FCP-invite.pdf 
beck-s	 To:  Enron North America Corp.  From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon   In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20 implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20 continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20 people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets= ,=20 and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20 within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the= =20 corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th= e=20 following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the= =20 Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.  1) Coverage/Origination:  To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product= =20 technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20 businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated= =20 under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups whic= h=20 focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and g= as=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a= =20 broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20 including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an= d=20 mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,= =20 textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20 Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.  Downstream Coverage/Origination  As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha= t=20 the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both= =20 ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand= =20 its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20 solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron= =20 Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function= =20 will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener= gy=20 commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti= es=20 but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic= als,=20 plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional= =20 capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels= =20 groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper= =20 will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20 leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three= =20 sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage= =20 activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f= or=20 the provision of innovative=20 products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio= n=20 of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t= o=20 lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20 responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20 chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers= =20 Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=  the=20 coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t= he=20 provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20 heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile= s=20 and glass manufacturing industries.     Midstream Coverage/Origination  a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o= n=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern= =20 Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi= s=20 group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus = on=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The= y=20 will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20 opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the= =20 leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20 Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort= s; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f= ocus on=20 the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20 emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc= hant=20 power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked = =20 Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will= =20 continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20 Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur= ing=20 opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20 restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav= e=20 asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20 formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of= =20 Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join= =20 this newly formed business.  2) Commercial Transactions:=20  The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20 Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of= =20 transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex= ecuting=20 transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity= =20 of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20 Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20 Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical= =20 Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.  The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,= =20 execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction= =20 with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of= =20 which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This= =20 dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service= =20 and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20 resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to= =20 the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:  a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and= =20 Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20 include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy= =20 Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of= =20 Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today= =20 from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20 origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr= ial=20 origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20 Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is= =20 established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay= =20 Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing= =20 two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant= =20 Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni= or=20 members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a= nd=20 John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the= =20 Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We= =20 anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few= =20 weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20 Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu= de=20 Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition= =20 of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.  Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and= =20 Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary= =20 responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will= =20 continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior= =20 commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua= l=20 responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20 Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai= n=20 largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20 Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located= =20 together.  We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag= e=20 and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri= al=20 markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe= en=20 the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20  Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor= th=20 America by working with us to implement these changes. 
beck-s	 why are these volumes flowing?        
beck-s	 Jeff,  I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's  organization and the Research Group.   Date:   April 27 - April 29 Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado   As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction  project currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this  effort which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic  optimization and stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).  The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish  transfer  of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project  in the future.  We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to  have on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The  effort of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in  terms of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who  often have highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.  I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and  Friday  morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote Friday afternoon to more general topics.  Vince

beck-s	 I'd be interested to see who else is sponsoring the conference and who the  other panelists would be.  Since it is a first year conference, the success  of it is highly dependent on the people who are pulling it together.  Since  the deadline on the sponsorship form is Sept. 8, they should be able to give  us an indication of other participants.  Do you want me to call Suresh to  find out - he's been emailing me every other day about how interested he is  in working for EBS anyway.  The timing of it is good - the week after  everyone comes for Super Saturday.  I'd also be interested in what Tom says.  I'd only do a Gold sponsorship - I don't think we need or want to be on more  than 1 panel - either the corporate finance or sales and trading.

beck-s	 Hello Vince,   I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, Mrs. Shirley notified me  that you were out of the country.  Look, I need another favor.  My wife, whom  you met last summer, and I  have been living in The Woodlands about a month  now.  We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as  a speech pathologist or a K-6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a  teaching job in the Houston Independent School District. However, I would  prefer that she taught locally, in The Woodlands.  I need to know if you know  of anyone we can contact to get her in The Woodlands School System.  I would  greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again.  I am attaching her  resume' for your perusal. Thanks A Million Vince!!!  Sincerely,  Datren Williams EES x 58654

Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load  to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of  three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If  anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to  call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I  will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you  can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on  vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to  the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and  HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do  this.  Thank you,  Mary  
beck-s	 Steve,  I spoke with David ealier today.  He is planning a meeting with Jim Tour to  due diligence the technology.    I would like to put together a team to drive MEC's strategy, including a  consolidation in Houston.  We would trade this commitment for warrants in the  company and a right to participate in future fundings.  Effectively, our team  could help drive the strategy for the company and due diligence a possible  investment at the same time.  Thanks, mark     Steven J Kean@EES 07/26/2000 05:11 PM To: Mark Lay/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Rex Shelby/Enron Communications@Enron Communications@ECT, Mike  McConnell@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON@ECT, Fabricio Soares/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: MEC    I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3  years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation  from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest  in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough  to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you  all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend  some time with them.

We spoke with Harvey and  Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.   There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early  development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one  thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on  the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as  part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our  resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that  sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.  Mark x37408

Set out below are the results of these runs.  The interfaces for Enron North America (financial for gas, weather, and pulp  and paper) were error free. The interfaces for ENA Global Products--Financial resulted in two invoices  not being accepted by SAP. This was due to a SAP error that has occurred  about three times in test. However, the SAP team cannot duplicate the error  in order to correct. They are still trying to find the root of this problem.  The two transactions which were not picked up by SAP were resent successfully. The interfaces for ENA FX Financial uncovered a breakdown in the process. The  payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the Accounts  Payable Dept. For July 5 and today, the AP Dept. forgot to process the  payment program resulting in nine payments (7 US $, 1 Canadian, and 1 GBP)  not  being paid. We were able to get all payments out today through SAP  except the GBP payment. The GBP non-payment was discovered by a counterparty  calling and stating that they did not received their funds. The US$ and  Canadian non-payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements  and found that the funds were not disbursed. For future interfaces, Bernard  is to call Treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the  payments for this entity were received by them.    Bob

I am currently a research Fellow with UCL conducting research, and building forecasting models for the statistical prediction of North Atlantic Sea  Surface Temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads (1-12 months ahead of forecast period).  I have recently applied this model to the North Sea in order to aid long-lead forecasts of Fish Stocks (see SAP-symposium, 4-6 December, Bergen, Norway),  and have recently been applying similar models to the North Atlantic Oscillation,  an atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over UK/Norway and NW Europe, particularly temperatures, rainfall and windspeeds  (see enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on the NAO in Vigo, Spain)  As you will see from my CV, I have 2+ years experience consulting in several areas of geoscience to the oil, gas and minerals industries and have good programming skills, both on Unix machines and on PCs.  I am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and  initiate a permanent career path.  I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further  with you in the near future.

beck-s	 We are for the most part finished with SEC VaR.  We are missing October and  December Brent Crude Commodity Positions.  When we get these numbers we will  reissue this report, but they are not likely to be different enough from the  guesses we inserted to make a difference.   Total VaR is the highest I have seen at $92 million.    One reason is that trading commodities VaR remains very high at $66 million  (though it is down from the $81 million of November).    The other reason is that trading securities VaR is by far the highest it has  been at $63 million.  Merchant Assets (with a VaR of $29 million) and total  return swaps (with a VaR of $56, up from $24 in November) are at all time  highs.   Bacchus and Riva (both originated in December) conspired to increase total  return swap VaR.  Nevertheless, the biggest culprit is Cerberus (a fixed for  EOG shares swap we put on in November).  Cerberus contains ten million  unhedged shares of EOG.  The value of the shares increased from $42 in  November to $55 in December, raising VaR substantially.  Regards,    Eugenio 
beck-s	 Vince/Stinson,  The note below gives us the authorization to proceed.  I have received no  comments from Wade on my signing, but I have his approval for the study, so I  will proceed on that basis.  Since we do not have any format of confidentiality agreement from Jim, let us  use the one signed by the legal team for the Japan study by Henwood.  In this  reference, could you (Stinson) get this from either Heather Mitchell, or John  Viverito (who is the lawyer involved with Japan, reporting to Alan  Aronowitz).  We could use that as template and proceed before Friday on that  basis.

I was not  able to download my messages in time for the calls, but I will be on going  forward.  While I am still on vacation, I have been in conversation with Vince and the  Research Group following up on the Henwood study we had spoken about.  We  have received a formal proposal from Henwood, and they are wanting  authorization to go forward.  The study will get us the despatch forecasts  for the next 8-10 years, and will deliver the results by January end, per  Henwood.  Vince and I have reviewed the proposal, and feel that we should proceed.  We  will be fine tuning the assignment as we go forward.  The big issue there is  the data for the model/s, and at this point Henwood is relying more on us to  provide the data.  We spoke to Henwood yesterday, and I will be on another  call with them on Friday.  I need your confirmation on the following:  That I have your approval to proceed ahead with the study  That the study shall be paid for by DPC, and if so, is it OK for me to sign  the authorization being sent by Henwood We will need a formal confidentiality agreement to be in place by tomorrow  (Jim - if you have a particular format, please let me know) I am leaving the issue of hourly rates and cost to the Research group since  they have more experience in dealing with groups like Henwood.  They feel the  costs are reasonable, and I will leave it at that.  We will need to collect data from the different sources we have in India, and  I have proposed that there be a formal session in India between Henwood and  the ENE team in India in the week between 10th and 15th.  This is important  to insure that there are no disconnects, and that there are no illusions on  the quality of the data that will be available.  It will also help us  formalize the scope and better define the issues.  In order to meet the  deadlines, the data will have to be in place by January 15th.  I will call Jim later today (I had called but you were on a call).  I am here  till the weekend when I leave for India.  Please let me know if this  arrangement is OK.  Regards, Sandeep.

The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19  position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.  I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of  numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page.

beck-s	 Sally  Here is a rough draft of my notes from our visit yesterday. Please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to  communicate.  My suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit  with Brent off site. Maybe over a cocktail.  I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned  What you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking  him to fill in the details with actions over the next four to five months.  1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next  level and by focusing and delivering these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others  and most importantly himself.  2)  You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by  insuring that he will "take care of the business, completely and totally."  No hits to the P & L,  zero tolerance for  incompetency and complacency.  You can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence  in his performance  Additionally he must identify and develop his successor.  Get a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work  Also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully  in this effort as long as he does his part and keeps you informed.  Call me if needed.  Tom       - Sally Beck Notes for Brent Price August 2000.doc

beck-s	 Greg,  Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.  1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.      Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and       experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent       Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old       shoulders.       One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is  between      maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks.   2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of  using the skills of Tony Mends.     Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very  smart     and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that  relies     on processing huge volumes of information.  Vince

beck-s	 Hi:  I am the newly hired Safety and Environmental Supervisor at EGEMINSA,  Panama.  Please let us know if we can be of assistance to you or Sally in any  way.   Greetings. 
beck-s	 Dear Vince,  I am writing to bring to your attention a GSIA student, John Gordon, who is currently being considered for Enron's Associates program.  My understanding is that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as a late addition to the program.  While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an ideal candidate if you are willing to make an exception.  He is a terrific finance student with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. Since John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional background reading about finance and energy.  John is personable and outgoing.  Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would have already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at play here.  I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.  A copy of his resume is attached to this email.

beck-s	 Vince  Thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday: I want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of VAR.  We need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions, for example, are easily made, supported and reviewed.   It became clear after last Friday's events, that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle VAR here, particularly at "pressure points".  I am putting together the scope of a "general overhaul" of the VAR process, including method and administration, to which I hope we would all buy in, so be assured of our co-operation.

beck-s	 Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has  changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran  into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she  would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not  confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want  950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a  change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin  Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for  the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat  !!!  
beck-s	 Vince,  This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not hurt my feelings by "slashing away" with a red pen.  I think that I have put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still pretty crude.  Help me "refine" the work to create something we can both be very proud of.  By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know as soon as I have a final deadline.  Your friend,  John  p.s. Hope life is a bit calmer for you.  By the way, I'm reading an interesting book entitled "The Four Agreements" by Miguel Ruiz that documents the Toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of reality that we all create.  You might enjoy it.  - Enron_Paper_1_16_01.doc  John D. Martin Carr P.

beck-s	 Dale,  Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you= =20 mentioned=20 another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  compa= ny=20 employees on a case-study.  The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the= =20 purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us= =20 to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model=20 internally.  Please, let me know more about this option.  We are primarily interested in a long-term natural gas model and the databa= se=20 for North America. =20 Unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite, we don't= =20 have resources to spend too much time on it.  Of course, a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model. I shall talk to them about it.  Vince      "Dale M. Nesbitt" <dale.nesbitt@worldnet.att.net> on 11/13/2000 06:00:05 PM To: <john.goodpasture@enron.com>, "Vince. J. Kaminski"=20 <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: =20 Subject: MarketPoint License Agreement   John/Vince:  I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.  As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire bundled product, which includes  ? North American gas, short and long term ? North American electricity, short and long term ? World gas ? Western European gas ? World oil  We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea= n gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business.  As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil= l want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20  the fully bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for=20  the software license plus the data license for a total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20  the fully bundled price.  I think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from MarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to = another model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga= s decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward.)  I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou= r approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam= e time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business.  If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo= u begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20  day training seminar. Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20  day training seminar. Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks later.  Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting tha= t I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

beck-s	 Kim,    After yestersday's meeting, I've come up with an idea which is applicable to  the zone EF and seems also to be applicable to the broader area. The model assumes that if  there are positive spreads of energy products between pairs of locations, we can always find the possibilities of  swaptions. This assumption, as  discussed with Jim and Sean, is a reasonable approximation. I suggest that  the prototype be built up at this model if you think that it is rational.  If you interested in the model, I  will explain it to all of you.   Best regards,  Youyi 
beck-s	 In an effort to be more proactive, we have contacted each supervisor, whose  employee received a "needs improvement" ranking.

The report contains a list  of "needs improvement" employees and their status. Please let me know if you  have any questions.   Regards, Frank deJesus

We met last year at the Sydney EPRM conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which you spoke.  As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management. We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):  North America - TVA - Ontario Power - Cinergy - Bonneville Power  Europe - Enel - ATEL - Electrabel - EDF  Nordic - Vattenfall - Fortum - Sydkraft - Statkraft - Birka Energi - Norsk Hydro  Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100 delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk management for the energy sector.  The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around using our software.  This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.  I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the highlight of the conference.  The subject could be:  *    a general energy risk related topic *    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in the energy markets *    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide  Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation, food and drink.  What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging views.

Interface number one (8:40 AM)  was error free. The second interface (Noon) created duplicate invoices for  those sent in our first interface. The problem that caused the duplication  was that the flag in UNIFY that prevents invoices from being sent to SAP  after they have already been interfaced did not work. The problem was  corrected before out third interface at 3:15 PM. In the 3:15 interface, one  error occurred --- a counterparty was set up in Global as intercompany that  should be third party. This error will be corrected before our next interface  on 7/6 AM.  Overall, I was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast  the SAP and UNIFY teams responded to our issues.

There may be changes made to the set flow  periodically, but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of  the Copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their  system.  Whenever Entex asks for a new set point at the new Woodlands city  gate, our set point at the new Bammel interconnect should align with that  same set point so as there is no swing service on the Copano pipeline.  Our  instructions should only come from Entex to change the set point, and should  be confirmed with Copano.  We are not to provide any instantaneous swing  service on the Copano Lake Creek lateral.  Any swing provided by HPL for the  Woodland's load will be made into the Copano 12" (formerly KSC) line as  historically done.  There may be additional capacity needed on the Lake Creek  lateral because of the revised set point, but that is something that Entex  has negotiated with Copano independent of HPL.  Still fuzzy?

Innovation/Entrapraneurship No Basis  Communicating Goal Setting No Basis  Team Work / Communication Excellent.  Very easy to work with and get along with.  Business Instincts Excellent.  Krishnar is consistent in asking to help out and asking what more  he could do to help us out.  Analystical Technical Excellent.  Krishnar has a very strong grasp of what we are doing and how it  should be done.  Overall Excellent.  My interactions with Krishnar have been limited but positive.   Krishnar is always positive with a positive attitude to get the job done.  Strengths: Very strong analytical skills with a desire to add value.  Areas for Improvements I don't understand Krisnar's role (is leading all research people on our  floor or just some) well and have had limited interaction with him.  {all has  been positive when it has ocurred} This suggests that Krishnar might spend  more time define what his people are doing and getting feedback about their  performance, and developing the project scope better.

beck-s	 Hi Karolina,  Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time  difference, why don't we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?   My number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I  can call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.  The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the  capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but  in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout  the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for  the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each  plant's aggregate values are reported.  I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL  query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making  appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I  can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine  at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,  so it may be available now.  Let's talk and maybe we can help you out, Michael  >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>> Michael,  I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I  am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems.  I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack  and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each  station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea  Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations  according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station  Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:  For each hour, for each generating station:  "marginal cost" [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] -  VOM_cost [o/MWh]  This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a  marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above  calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea  Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and  TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.  Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which  outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?  It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market  values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since  privatisation.  The following points come out 1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB 2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end  1998 when the ratio was c1.5x. 3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has  been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal  significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in  share prices in the last year  Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of  water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market  value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a  little.  On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result  has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I  await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be  more modest than the last one !

beck-s	 Bob, I want to thank you for your response time in getting Cody a draft of the amendment for them to look at this morning. Cody will be out of their current obligation for this gas on February 11th, I will firm this date up  here in the next couple of days. Cody has requested that we strike the Gas Daily Price for gas brought on any day other than the 1st day of the month. This  language is mentioned in Article 2. Contract Price. 2.1 Price. I have called  Darren Farmer on the Texas Desk and explained my situation to him. He  passed on to me that this is not a problem since I will know the date and  volume this package will start flowing to HPLC.  Please e-mail a copy after these changes for approval to be sent overnight to Cody. Thanks!

beck-s	 Dear all,  If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus  planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they  have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.  I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared  between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support  Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if  there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in  Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below  you will find the results of that research.  In short the conclusions are these: The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support  Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem. In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus  matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000. Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression  problem occurs.    The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed  and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a  variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and  will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss  further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.  Regards, Kim

Once we have a meeting of minds on the set of issues, we can discuss further how best to collaborate and accomplish our goals.  I believe both sides would benefit immensely.  MIT faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive some answers you are looking for!

beck-s	 Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need  details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on EnronOnline.    In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for  electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top  25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals  electronically.    Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.  thanks Sheri ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT on 06/14/2000 09:46  AM ---------------------------       From:  Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny                                                              06/14/2000 09:46 AM
beck-s	 Stinson,  I'm not sure who was going to handle this project - Tom Moore or Laine  Borgman.  So, by this e-mail, I will ask the appropriate person to respond to  you.  I have also given Tom's name and e-mail address to Ms. Geman.   They will just need to change in Article 17 of the Software License Agreement  the response time from 2 to 3 days and the Software License part should be  done.  The only thing that would leave then is Ms. Geman's response regarding  the Escrow Agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm  (who would be holding the source code in escrow).  I'm not sure whether Ms.  Geman has responded to Tom about that or not.  I have sent electronic copies  of all of the documents to both Tom and Laine to finalize once Ms. Geman  responded.  Tom can be reached at:  x55552 Laine can be reached at:  x56470   Thanks, Karla

Your responses will make planning a bit easier on this end.  Also, please get me your "one-page" background statement as soon as possible.  I am attaching Michael Froehl's to give you some guidance (thanks Michael, I thought I was going to have to prepare mine first).  Let me also tell you that the television producer has requested 15 minutes of each of your time either the morning of the 23rd before the luncheon or after the workshops to do individual interviews.  They will then work these individual shots into the final edited program (bring your best TV smiles).  By the way, I have been assured by the producer that we have final say over whether particular comments are edited in or out of the final product so we can all relax, this is not live TV.  I'll be out of town the end of next week but hope to have all my plans put together the following week so please respond to both the questionnaire and the request for a one-page background/positions/ideas write-up.  Thanks guys and I'm looking forward to seeing you all very soon.  John  p.s.

We  enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with  Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as  well.  We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and  additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January  19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We  plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are  considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either (i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to  serve retail customers, OR (ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas  for further investments.  However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy  Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to  suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind;  so please let us know.  We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but  here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:  Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is  in the annual report? What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure? Who are the customers and how are they acquired? What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron? What are the international expansion plans and capabilities? Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?  If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent,  will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?  After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to  schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly  involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in  the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to  call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.  Regards, Retail Energy Services Tiger Team Ram Dennis Jason Omar Steve Clay   
beck-s	 Shona, Brent and Sally, This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by  Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296  this morning.  Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk  Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving  global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into  another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk  Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its  cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by  being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from  the ECT Group on Friday.  Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge Enron's cash flows when  so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a  good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily  by 7:30 am.  Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for  changes in book heirarchy.   Sheila

beck-s	 Folks,  Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the  petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged  drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and  possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these  assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the  estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other  facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.  Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial  complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to  experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties  identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado,  Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine  whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.   Thanks,  Charlie

Further, I have tentatively set up the Thur. return flight to Austin at 3:38 p.m., and that can be modified as desired.  >Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree >Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names). When I made the room reservation last Mon. 6/12, it turned out that these hotels showed no vacancy (is there a conference in town?), so the nearest I could obtain is the Hilton Houston Plaza (6633 Travis) some 3.5 miles away from Enron.  (If it is important that I stay at the closer hotels, Shirley might ascertain whether Enron's travel agent can obtain a room there.)  I take this opportunity to request of Shirley that, subject to your approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available for the room where the 11:30 luncheon meeting takes place.  Also, since I would like each participant to have his/her own copy, I would ask her to advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend, or alternatively, Shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when I bring the "master" copy in Thur. morn.  I look forward to seeing you Wed. and Thur.  Best Regards, Ehud  ==============================================      Ehud I.

beck-s	 Jeff,  We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.   The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince                                            ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India                       Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001                      By ANGUS DONALD                       Tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern India                      yesterday after a power grid breakdown.                        Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the                      capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored                      by the end of the day, according to power grid  officials.                        The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Assocham), a                      leading business organisation, expressed "deep concern"  and called for a                      mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "cripple the economy".                        The power failure across eight Indian states, including  New Delhi, disrupted                      train services, water supplies and the telephone network  and forced                      hospitals to switch to emergency generators.                        The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides  electricity for 226m                      people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana,  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,                      Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu  and Kashmir.                        A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh,  India's most                      populous state, caused an overload of power on other  lines, which then                      failed as well.                        Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were                      damaged. New Delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before                      its own power supply could be engaged.                        "We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is  most likely to be a                      technical failure, but we will investigate why it  happened," Suresh Prabhu,                      the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust  of India.                        India suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to                      upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big  problem. Thirty per                      cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according  to analysts. In New                      Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen.                        Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh  and Delhi for                      hours.                        Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing  industrial demand                      would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's  inefficient power                      sector. "The slow progress, particularly in  strengthening the transmission                      and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will  contribute to                      worsening the power supply situation further."

Its "myth and reality" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west Indian                      state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it  pays the Texas-based                      company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating  plant at Dabhol is                      India's biggest single foreign investment.                        Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times                      greater than that charged by other independent power  producers (IPPs).                      The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the                      dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel. The state also pays                      a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month,  reflecting the                      huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of  consumption.                        A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that                      damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former  official of the World                      Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is  emerging "as the East                      India Company of the 21st century" - a reference to the  British trader that                      colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th  century.                        The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power  sector. The UK's PowerGen                      and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently,  frustrated by long approval                      procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher                      returns elsewhere.                        "India has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six                      percentage points," says Gerry Grove-White, former India  general manager                      of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat  to China Light &                      Power of Hong Kong.                        India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity                      must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since  1992, IPPs have                      added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under  construction. This is                      insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic                      growth.                        Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation,  winning fast-track project                      approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant  fuelled by expensive                      naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a  Dollars 1.87bn plant                      of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas (LNG),                      will be completed this year. Only two of seven other  fast-track proposals                      have achieved financial closure.                        From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating  in Maharashtra's                      then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating                      terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister  of the successor                      government, says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable.                        Enron, whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists, wants to maintain                      good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment. Enron views                      India as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of                      power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities,  such as energy, gas                      and bandwidth.                        To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy  between power                      surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed  this year. It is building                      an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas. And it is                      laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country                      desperately short of this new economy commodity.                        In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight  contract. It is supported by                      many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor                      perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and  industrial hub, as an                      unreliable destination for investment.                        Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor, which                      threatened to "dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea" - is  under pressure from                      radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options  are limited.                      Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state                      that would have to compensate shareholders.                        Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility  and Enron's main                      client, is obliged to dispatch or "off-take" 90 per cent  of Dabhol's output. Yet                      MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take  has averaged 60                      per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has  been paying a lot                      more while consuming a lot less power.                        One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough  new regulator has                      told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the  tariff would be                      Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But  with off-take a                      third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and  often higher. In                      October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take  was about 49 per                      cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2,  run on cheaper                      LNG, starts.                        These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only  half of a 30 per                      cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the  balance and                      mandated bankers to find a buyer.                        Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs,  which have failed to                      deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared  they would never be                      paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt                      management of power.                        Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic  pricing means                      industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as  transmission and                      distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and  technical losses, is                      overdue. "Given the limited resources, money would be  better spent on T&D                      rather than on new plant," says Oliver Blackaby,  managing director of N M                      Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the  privatisation of its                      distribution network.                        For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to  satisfy the                      competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay  Bhatnagar, chief                      executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade  magazine, one of the                      key lessons learned from phase 2 is "having flexibility  to deal with                      externalities".

beck-s	  FYI...ONLY !   Presently, I have scheduled  a 10.0m buyback at this interconnect due to the  plant being down and   the status is day to day.   The 10.0m buyback begun Wednesday, April 5th.    Gary, please let me know how you want this interconnect allocated { ie:   force majeure & allocate total   flow to the base ticket ; Sitara # 148390}. 
beck-s	 Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of  our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data  along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price  will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the  web or via automated processes.    Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to  date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define  additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely  what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the  actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to  generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure  Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and  expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data  is available via D&B Connect.  Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a  longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing  with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your  perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of  customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his  boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long  term preferential contract that we are looking for.  Let's discuss further.  bryan      Mary Solmonson 05/05/2000 19:25 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stuart  Ffoulkes/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Dun & Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading  I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several  issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better  solution for the money.    Option 1 The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to  monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.  Option 2 I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If  you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :    2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores  that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per  record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently  with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive  alternative          (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).   2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be  provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a  weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has  not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates  than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to  transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost  for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score.   Option 3 D&B Connect Product.  D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated  reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that  enables the  most effective integration of customer information and  third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and  information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate  identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete  relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of  referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so  that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your  organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B  Connect is scalable.     Cost Typically ranging from  * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000  * CAM Online - $50,000  * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data  With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.   Questions/Issues  1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron  customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained  that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers,  but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available  externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this  understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be  imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be  negotiated.  2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?   Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score reference  above were explored as an example.  3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?  4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S.  companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of  default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This  rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.   This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this  score in a batch manner.  5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit  analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is  probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if  the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased  usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

beck-s	 We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.  Megan 
beck-s	 sure it works -- I just need to schedule the nanny to stay late  -- I will  ask her this evening which night she can stay -- would be fun to see you  both.  I saw a lot of Brent the last time he was here, but haven't seen you  in a while.  I will call or email you tomorrow with a definite.  B         
beck-s	 Kim,  I spoke with Bill Bradford, VP in Enron's Credit Department, and he offered  to field your questions regarding Credit.  He will be in the office this  week.  You can call him at 713-853-3831.    Regarding Nymex traders, what kind of trader are you interested in?  Larry  Gagliardi trades Nymex crude products.  Let me know if you need his number  again, or if you think someone else would be more helpful.  good luck  ken ______________________ We are still interested in talking to someone in the Risk Assessment Group  about credit rating systems.   Could you get us the name of the contact who trades directly with Nymex? 
beck-s	 That's fine.  I didn't want to change anything until I heard from you guys.  See ya!  John  At 11:06 AM 11/28/00 -0600, you wrote: > >John, > >Thanks.

beck-s	 In the West, the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on  control (and sometimes conflict -- somewhat like prison guard vs. inmates).   Nevertheless, in Japan, it has until recently been based on cooperation (more  like a coach and team).  The Japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the  nation as a whole and have begun changing it.  This process is disconcerting  and has powerful emotions attached to it.  I thought you might find this article interesting, since it shows some of the  complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to  Westerners.  Regards,    Eugenio

beck-s	 Executive Summary:  SB-7X gives Dept. of Water and Resources given legislative authority to  undertake short-term power purchases with no price cap through Feb.2nd New legislation (AB-1X and SB-6X) would seek (1) long-term contracts with 5.5  cent cap and (2) creation of California Power and Conservation Financing  Authority The long-term contracts proposed in AB-1X are likely to be subject to  significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the Feb.2nd expiration of  SB-7X. The authority proposed in SB-6X would have bond issuance powers to finance  new generation capacity and conservation measures Negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility  bailout--utilities and state government split over debt obligations of  utility parents State borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state  treasury; SoCal Edison misses more payments Bush Administration opposes price caps, but is supporting state efforts to  split PG&E into separate gas and electricity companies in order to assure  continued gas supply Absent urgent passage of a bailout plan or an agreement on longer-term  contracts, utility bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario.  For further information, contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510).  1. Legislation Passes- Short-Term Measures  SB-7X passed the California State Senate easily.  As we said yesterday, the  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  Department of Water and Resources until February 2nd.  The Department will  have $400 million available to finance power purchases, but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $1 billion by next week.  AB-1X has evolved into a longer-term solution and in its current form, would  authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into long-term  contracts (as opposed to the 15 day contracts in SB-7X) to buy power at a  price cap of 5.5 cents per kw/h.  This legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by SB-7X, when negotiations between generators, the utilities,  and the state are likely to resume.  2. SB-6X- What Will the State Do With the Bond Authority?  A second piece of legislation currently under consideration --SB 6X--has  created uncertainty in the markets.  This legislation will create a  California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with bond issuance  authority.  The uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address  the problem of the $12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities.   The current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such  as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency. Yet the  legislation also says "the authority may issue bonds, exercise power of  eminent domain, and enter into joint power agreements and buy, own, and sell  land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project."  The general  nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds  to finance past debts, or using eminent domain or the bond authority to  finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch.11 proceeding.  While neither  Davis nor Senate leader Burton are talking about a full $12 billion bailout  at this point, the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to  circulate in the legislature.  One of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand  repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the Governor's office  that  there will be a government-supported debt workout in the near future.  3. Bailout Could Depend on Parents of Utilities Absorbing Losses  The big problem -- and one which have kept the Governor nor the utility  companies from opting for this solution -- is a massive battle over how much  of the  outstanding $12 billion in back debt the holding companies of the two  utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal. As we have reported,  something like half  of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister power-generating  companies within their holding company structure (the partial de-regulation  allowed the utilities to split into power-generating and power-distributing  companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other side)  --  and public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite  well. Davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this  debt, and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their  corporate structures; we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or  issue  bonds to deal with the rest.  As one very senior California political leader explained, getting the utility  holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves  is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread  public outrage about a "bailout" of private price-gouging companies with  taxpayer money. Since 75% of Californians currently blame the utilities and  the PUC for this crisis (and only 10% blame Davis), this is a crucial  political stance for the Governor.   But, of course, absorbing anything like $6 billion in debt would be quite a  shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power-generating branches  of the two utilities, and they began spreading the word that they were quite  willing to accept bankruptcy. Thus by mid-week, both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court  that would be a worst case solution for all sides: The country's economy  would  suffer from the resulting credit shock, the Governor's political future would  suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a  bankruptcy judge, while most private sector legal authorities believe the  utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during  bankruptcy  procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of  the debt in the end. In addition, they would most likely face a state  government  determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in  a major way.   Senator Burton's SB6X legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically  to make this point quite explicit. It would set up a "California Power and  Conservation  Financing Authority," with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent  domain. It would finance new power plants, and "consider the feasibility and  public  interest of the state acquiring, operating, and maintaining transmission  facilities currently owned by investor-owned and municipal utilities."   As we write this, all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the  bankruptcy ledge to safe ground, and there is no question the tone has  shifted  in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to "maybe we've run this thing  out as far as we can." But as we have noted, the chance for miscalculation is  still quite high. There is no solution agreed to at this time, the stand-off  over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities'  holding  company is continuing, and the technical fact of default still makes it  possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate  accelerated payment.   5. Default Update- Thursday  SoCal Edison- $215 million default to California Power Exchange.  After Edison failed to make a $215M electricity payment yesterday, the  California Power Authority began seizing long-term contacts and reselling  them to recoup some of the money owed to generators.  PG&E said it expects  its trading privileges at the Cal. Power Authority to be suspended today,  leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources.  While the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted PG&E's and SoCal's  ability to buy power, the Department of Water and Resources will be able to  pick up some of the slack, at least in the very short-term.  The state itself may be getting into risky credit territory.  The proposed  California Public Power Authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $1.3  billion from the state General Fund in advance of this year's expected fiscal  surplus, with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future  revenues.  With near-bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes, it is  unclear where the revenues would come from.  The amount borrowed and terms of  repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating  agencies.  5. Bush Policies  As we reported on Wednesday, the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved in the California crisis.   President-Elect Bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments,  which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root  of the current supply shortage.  Bush and his top officials appear to be  unanimously opposed to long-term price caps.  However, there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration,  according to a source close to a top Bush economic advisor.  There is  significant concern that PG&E's credit problems could cause gas suppliers to  stop shipments of gas through PG&E's pipeline.   The risk would be that the  pipeline could "go dry", causing significant and possibly dangerous  disruptions in California residences and businesses.  To prevent this  problem, Bush is working with Davis on a proposal to split PG&E into separate  gas and electric companies. The gas company would be solvent, but the  electric company would go immediately into Ch.11 following significant  defaults.

beck-s	 To All EMSA students,  Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the Enron Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).  As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of President and CEO of Enron Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on at Enron and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a fascinating demonstration about Enron On-Line ( Enron's revolutionary idea that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now traded).  I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (Enron's new college recruiter) will be here, along with other Enron representatives, to meet and visit with you about career opportunities with Enron and discuss questions you might have about the energy industry in general.  Also, Enron will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day (Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of each of these companies. I know that Enron invites comparison, as they have obviously been very successful with their style.  Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, Enron, and especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms. Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought Enron to OU. We need to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we appreciate Enron's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The new "Participation Point  Policy" will be in effect for this and attendance and non-excused absences will be noted.  For your information, this week is the week to sign up for Enron interviews, through the Career Services website. Enron is scheduled to be here on Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday when interviewing with Enron.  Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments, please let me know.  See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at "An Evening with Enron".

beck-s	 Sandeep,  I am meeting Jeff on Tuesday, 1:30.  The best number to reach me (outside the office) is my cell phone (always on): 713 410 5396. My home number is 281 367 5377.  Vince     Sandeep Kohli@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/06/2001 08:30 PM To: Vince J Kaminski@ECT cc:   Subject: Reminder  Vince,  Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk  to Jeff Shankman on Monday.  Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava,  who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for  promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is  also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real  asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young,  it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.  I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in  Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would  be a good number to call you on.    I look forward to working with the team in Research.  Thanks again,  Regards, Sandeep.  
beck-s	 Thank You     Vince J Kaminski@ECT 03/27/2000 01:02 PM To: Tasha Lair/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re:    Tasha,  Yes, I think Li Xiao deserves the bonus.  Vince Kaminski     Tasha Lair@ENRON 03/21/2000 02:24 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject:   Vince,  Linda Vargo asked me because I am the administrator of employee referral  program to contact you on whether or not Li Xiao is eligible for a bonus on  his referral of Alex Huang.  I have informed Linda that the decision up to  you.  If you feel that Alex Huang was hired as a result of Li bringing him to  the attention of Enron then the bonus is due.  Linda and yourself have  communicated via e-mail on this issue in early February and it appears from  that correspondence that Li did encourage Alex to e-mail his resume to you.   Please advise as to whether or not you want to award the bonus.  Thank You     
beck-s	 The purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday  with members from Commercial and Volume Managment concernig the Entex account:   Effective January 2000, Thu Nguyen (x37159) in the Volume Managment group,  will take over the responsibility of allocating the Entex contracts.  Howard  and Thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the  account over the next few months.  Entex will be Thu's primary account  especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations  process and the contracts.   Howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be  available for questions or as a backup, if necessary (thanks Howard for all  your hard work on the account this year!).     In the initial phases of this transistion, I would like to organize an Entex  "account" team.  The team (members from front office to back office) would  meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the  scheduling, allocations, settlements, contracts, deals, etc.  This hopefully  will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before  the finalization process, but to learn from each other relative to your  respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as  well.  I would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as I  believe this is a critical part to the success of the Entex account.    I will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1/2000.   If anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me or stop  by.  Thanks in advance for everyone's cooperation...........   Julie - Please add Thu to the confirmations distributions list

beck-s	 Vince,  I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with John Lehoczky and a PhD student.  We trying to apply recent advances in Monte Carlo for American options to value Swing and other options with multiple early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets.  I know in general that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts, both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such instruments?  We would like our examples to look realistic.  We also want to make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.

beck-s	 Daren:  You put this in, do have a clue?  Julie  ---------------------- Forwarded by Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT on 03/13/2000 04:30  PM ---------------------------     
beck-s	 This is to have written record of nom on 3/21/2000 and following.  The nomination into Eastrans is 75,000 MMBtu, but since PG & E cut HPL's contract effective 3/21/2000 to 44,482 from 50,000, the redeliveries will be as follows:  44,482 to PG & E 21,518 to Mobil Beaumont 3,000 int o Cartwheel at Carthage 
beck-s	 The difference is $4,391. You can send more if you would like to add to the tax-free money fund. Thank you Keith Hazlewood  Edward Jones P.O. Box 9479 The Woodlands, TX 77387 
beck-s	 Fernley, Generally, this seems to be fine.  I think that Steve and I would like to  clarify the credit limit review issue.  Please see him for some semantical  changes to that one line.   Regarding the expected/maximum exposure calculation,  I believe that this is  incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own  interpretation.    WE LOST $18MM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - NOT $5MM.  I think  that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as  opposed to what writedowns need to be taken, but it all better add up to  $18MM.  Regarding the additional exposures, my impression is that our true  expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to  terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost.

Some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still  draft and I expect firm numbers in the next few hours.   My aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to Joe Sutton,  but I would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and  whether or not this format is appropriate.  Regards  Fernley          
beck-s	 In my absence, Bruce McMills will be the commercial DEFS contact for Tuesday, August 8th. 
beck-s	 Congratulations on your promotion!  I'm very happy for you.  It's good to see  the recognition for leadership in commercial support roles.  Regards,  Susan

beck-s	 Hi guys,  it was nice to work with each of you for the last couple of weeks. It was  great time and I enjoyed every single day here. I am very much impressed with research team in Houston and looking forward to  strengthen our co-operation even further.  Have all great time and not a very hot summer. hope to see all you soon.  many thanks,  Slava 
beck-s	 I think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in Desk assignments  and responsibilities.  With that said, I am listing some of the current  issues that I have seen, that will need to be addressed quickly.  Most of  these issues are none of my business, but since I see unpathed gas I thought  you two might want to dicsuss these issues.  Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we  stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get  this assigned?  I can find old    notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let  me know.  Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for  ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1.  MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and  Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with  transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it  stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I  thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:   1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left  unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed  appropriately.  Someone   needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero,  that were nominated for January.   2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This  issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot  allocate was is   not pathed and nominated.     3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point  specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203  10,000).  This is a pathed    pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the  rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this  transaction, we are not legally covered.    Carlos was handling this pipe in  Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan?  HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December  and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back  next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.    Pat  -   The following  was my recollection of the assignments for Dec 1 to  the present.  You might want to confirm with Mary Smith and then you can  proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned  issues.  Hank Eisenhours duties were split :  Mandey -   Handle all long term HPLC expense issues:  undeveloped contracts,  December flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues.  Carlos  -  All offsystem transactions for ENA and HPLC in Unify and all  offsystem paper and electronic noms on Intrastate Pipes.  Ami and Stacey   also handle some.  There is a lot of confusion here.  I found unpathed gas  for December.  We'll need to address this one quickly.  HPL Transports were all split by zone.  Each Logistics rep is responsible for  pathing all meters in their assigned zones in Unify.  HPL Operational seems to be left unassigned.   I think most of the desk assumed that Carlos took over Hanks  responsibilities.  The assignments above are my recollection only.

beck-s	 On Monday we have to file a "transition plan" with Louise Kitchen for NETCO. She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)  Tks - Bob 
beck-s	 Carol, thanks.  Anne:  we need to send this list to AEP to ensure they agree that this is the  extent of our "Books and Records" obligations at Close.

What I have at  present is a report from our SCADA system that must be run manually each day, to get a report of Yesterday's Volumes, beginning and ending at 7:00 a.m.  The problem is, until  I can revise it, the report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers, and I need to create a new one with only the HPL stations.  I also want to set it up for automatic creation, to run at approx. 8:00 a.m. daily.  It would then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board, such as  is currently being operated by George Perrine.  I will be coordinating this effort with George in that regard.  Until I have completed the entire task, however, I will try to send you a daily (5 days per week) report created manually, showing the previous day's volumes for our monitored HPL stations.  I am shooting for starting this tomorrow.      I have also been discussing this with Royal Edmondson of our Gas Supply Dept., and he wants us all to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information  between all interested parties.  He will be getting back with you on this.

Users named  are approvers for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Originator  Jennifer Frazer Trader/Financial Linda Clemmons Trader/Physical Jeff Shankman (will delegate to desk director) Sr Trading Manager Jeff Shankman Sr Operations Manager Sally Beck Administrator  Mary Solmonson  Originators will be the primary users (80-90% usage)   Followup Item: Mary Solmonson will finalize the User names for UAT signoff.  3)  Use Cases and Actors (user types) It was decided that capturing the requirements as Use cases will not be done  with the GIA business users.   Users stated that all types of users will have  access to all reports.  The functionality for each report will be same for  all user types.    Selection critieria and report content for each user type  will be controlled by a security  function.   Use case may still  be used by  the Technology team, when required, to help engineer a better technical  architecture.    4)  User Signoff of requirements document for Phase I deliverables: Signoff for non-administrative functions:  Jennifer Fraser Signoff for administrative functions:  Mary Solmonson  (addtl comments not discussed during yesterday's meeting) User change requests  to requirements after signoff will be evaluated for  impact to schedule and cost.  Need signoff for Phase I deliverables before  Phase I project schedule is finalized.    5)  New user requirements reviewed: Find Like Prospects (required for Phase I) Peak Daily Volumes (required for Phase VII)  Followup Item:  Lynette Malone:  Changes to requirements discussed in yesterday's meeting  need to be applied to the Requirements document   6)   Administrative Requirements Changes to administrative requirements are still outstanding.   Users are  meeting Friday, Feb 18 to discuss their requirements.    Based on the outcome  of that meeting, administrative deliverables for Phase I will have to be  reviewed again and cost and schedule will have to be re-evaluated.    Administrative requirements include GIA region administration,  Data  cleansing,  Administration of products/internal companies/deal nature to  identify deal activity captured in the Entelligence database.   Followup Item: Mary Solmonson:  Define changes to administrative requirements.  7)  User Preferences Requirements for User preferences are not yet defined. User preferences will  NOT be a Phase I deliverable.   Mary Solmonson said User preferences will  probably be deferred until Phase VII.

beck-s	 Hi Vince, The following is what I wrote to Molly as she prepares the contract for me to  work with Enron. I thank you for allowing me to work with Enron and will do all that I can to  make you happy with my candiates and performance. Thank you for you support Vince. Will check in soon, Jeff ******************************************************** Sorry about the mix-up on the email Molly. I hope you get this one.  As most good corporations like Enron have predefined contractual arrangements  to do Executive Search business I will be happy to abide by your terms and  rules. And to be quite honest- Enron is about the "best it gets" so, I prefer to not  draft a contract this time or for this relationship- I will wait for yours to  be signed by me.  The only stipulation I request of you is that upon  contractual performance, Enron Accounts Payable please wire my funds to my  account as I have a multi-currency account denominated in USD/Canadian or  British Pounds (which ever fits you as I may need to pay my counterparts in  the UK)...other than that I have no perplexities. I will send you my wire instructions later, either my bank in California or  in Bermuda. As I live in California and do contingency search, I must go off of my  client's "good word" on occasion and luckily haven't had any problems so  far...I always honor California Verbal Contract Law -if I do not draft. I think you fee payment of 20% is generous and the industry standard of 30  day guarantee on replacement is fair. Obviously there is no deposit on any  contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be  filled only then will I ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my  overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on Enron. As Enron has the in-house power to probably not need this service then  obviously a deposit will not be required. If you wish me to send my standard agreement then I will, but you have made  yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do. I therefore  will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions. I thank you and Vince for allowing me to work with Enron and pledge to you my  best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts. I am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very  best service. Thank you very much for this opportunity Molly, please send my your contract  so, that I may sign it and send it right back to you immediately. I am  looking forward to working with Vince and you. Thank you again, Jeff Wesley  Ps- I can utilize to resources of Management recruiters International USA and  Robert Walters of the UK to aid in my service to you.

I'm available to  speak throughout the day at 713-345-6976.  I can also contact you at your  convenience.  Thanks,  Joe Short       
beck-s	 It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts.  As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.  Thank you very much for your support.

beck-s	 Folks:  I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for  Wednesday,  December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from  3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me  know by  day's end.  Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston  will start  with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of  his work  and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have.  Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for  audiovisual  or other equipment.  This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the  subject of our meeting:  [...]   topics to be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are:  1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential operators to digital data, etc.)  2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which existing methods encounter stability problems.  There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which you are interested, I am willing to focus on them.

If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for  yourselves, please let me know.  This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area  of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and  attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).  We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the  seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester  season for schools).  A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be  talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about  the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

beck-s	 Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for  co-foounder/collaborators and angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I  call the system "LifeTrak") and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic  depicts an overview of the effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as  participants and member organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.   The groups fall into two natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.   In the middle is the system and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the  donor/recipient LifeTrak cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a  place to begin discuss and talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed  and supported and where the revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and  license fee.  I hope we can get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to  his other commitments, I have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more  at a later date.).

This is a second  tanker on which very few details are available . The LNG group is working as we speak to provide some information for Joe Sutton before his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon. There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte on Monday to send me one and was not told that he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest substitute.   Vince     John Sherriff 05/16/2000 12:20 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision     Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John    Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince    John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the  Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.  I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far  away).  Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.

beck-s	 On Tuesday, March 7th, Tejas took gas from us at Oasis Katy and gave it back  to us at Tejas Laporte to help us out during an outage for $.02/mmbtu.  This  transaction has not been scheduled correctly.  There are two deal tickets in  Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal:  #213145 covers ENA selling  the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.  Deal #213370 covers the  transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.  I have edited this  ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.  There needs to be a Tejas expense contract  at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25,000mm received there on the 7th.   These volumes are currently sitting on the Laporte OBA.  Jackie-  if you would work with Carlos he should be able to walk you through  getting this scheduled correctly in all systems.  Thanks. 
beck-s	 Tanya,  As we discussed in the last meeting, to simulate secondary power curve we  need correlated jump sizes. This is totally different from the current  secondary price curve simulation which assume the perfect correlation and  also totally different from the secondary GAS basis curve simulation which is  based on the hedging ratio.  There are two more issues on my side I need to resolve: 1. I want resolve the power basis curve issue.  Currently all power position  on these basis curve are actually price positions.  We are hard coding this:  if power basis we add basis to corresponding region curve.  I am trying to  remove this hard coding by asking loading the price curve for all these basis  locations.  2. Same is true for all those Power F curves.  These curves looks similar to  those basis curves.  Currently we just directly map these F curves to the  corresponding region curves.  I would also prefer to load the price curves  instead of the price differences.  From research, I need those jump size correlations.  Clearly, all these involve many new development, unless we want to use  simpler way to simulate secondary power curves.  Regards,  Winston      -----Original Message----- From:  Tamarchenko, Tanya   Sent: Monday, April 16, 2001 9:17 AM To: Lew, Jaesoo Cc: Gorny, Vladimir; Jia, Winston; Kaminski, Vince Subject: Re: clustering for power  Jaesoo, as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please, implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves  the following:  1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want  to use and which Enron's curves belong to each region. 2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each  region. This decision can  be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might  be other considerations. 3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core  curve.  Winston, can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo  with clustering done by SAS? Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this?   Tanya. 
beck-s	 Joe -  As a follow up on our meeting last week, I'm working with Rick Causey and  CAOs for ENA and Enron Europe to identify potential candidates and to refine  our job description for the local hire we want to recruit permanently.  Rick  wants to be closely involved in those decisions.  Would you please forward to  me some of the handouts you had with you or may have updated by now that  address the business environment, Gantt chart/timeline, office scope, timing  of business transactions etc. to aid in communicating Tokyo needs?  I'm not  sure if you sent anything to Sally, but I don't believe I've seen anything  yet.  Thank you,  Cassandra.

Vince:  Thanks again for meeting with me today and I am pleased that you are  interested in discussing this opportunity in more detail.  Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.  As discussed, the  Enron Media / Advertising idea is being developed under EBS, but should  develop into its own business unit.    Enron Media / Advertising: - Advertising Risk Book - Physical Trades, supported by excess inventory from Cable Networks, Radio,  Network TV, etc. - Media Buying Service  - Alliances with Advertising Agencies to sell Enron's "eyeballs" from our  customer / server - ISP relationships i.e., US West - Agencies could endorse EBS to their customers (Ford GM, Procter & Gamble,  etc.) and become an Extended Enterprise for EBS and our EIN applications   - Enron's Capital, to fund Content Development for the networks and  Hollywood, which in turn would provide content for our pipes with licensing  and syndication rights. - An Enron On Line B to B opportunity (You may want to review the following  sites: DoubleClick.com, Agency.com, AdAuction.com)  Mark and Kal:  Vince and I are meeting on Tuesday, March 28th @ 3:00 PM to further discuss  the development of the Enron Media /Advertising concept .

Gas Control was called on both these meters and    informed of the new numbers and asked to call Channels Gas Control to  confirm.    10:00am    Sam from Gas Control called and informed me that the Bayer plants  didn't want to take any gas from HPL  due to the water content. The tail  gate   still had the intraday change in place and so does Midcon apparently  so were rolling the move another day.  Lee said yesterday that he didn't    care were they get the gas. We will true up pops for the tailgate on TUES.  3:30pm  Bruce PGE   cutl again.   9dwe   was cut from 10000 down to 6988   9g96   was cut from 45000 down to the 41298 Bruce parked the gas for us.

New point total was 55176.  Called Gas Control and informed them of   the new  total and asked them to confirm with Channel's gas control. 10:00 pm Again Sam called and said we need to keep Milles/Bayer at the Tail  gate due to high water content.  So we did.  We will need to update pops.   1:00 pm               Marilyn from Oasis called with some cuts.  A 10000 and  a 5000 package was cut going to   ANP  TA0020.   I called Mark and  he said t  l move   the 10000 back haul to HPL which I did.   The 5000  Duke gas we  moved over to 5896 and will move to back to HPL on our 202 contract.   Marilyn   said there will be a 1% fuel and a 4 cent change but  we could pay  the fuel at another time or use it against the imbalance so she confirmed the  full   5000.    New meter total is 49765.  4:00pm                Cindy PGE called with more cuts   96d5 was cut from 16259 to 16100   9g96 was cut from 45000  to 36215.  Cindy said that they would not park the  gas this time for us.  I called Eddie to inform and he said he would call    Cindy and dazzle her with his charm and wit and fix the problem.  Well that  didn't work so we ended up moving it from TECO on the Mid TEX line   to 8740  on HPL.

beck-s	 SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems.   Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your  staff's salary is.  I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR  department to also give me the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most  likely are not what they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using  estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.  Here's what you can do:  1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to  average, etc.  You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that  position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average:   Sr. $4,961  Spec $3,964  Staff $3,026  Sr. Clrk $2,548  Clerk $2,264  Asst $3,162  Your list would look something like this:   Assistant Average  Clerk  Very High  Sr. Clerk Low  Specialist Low to Average  Specialist Average  Sr. Specialist Average to High  Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)  You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.  Next Item - TRAINING!!!  Here's what you can do:  1) List your staff and the type of class they need 2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what  type  of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or  Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip) 3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.  Next Item - Headhunters!  Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.   Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the  year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these  items, I will make sure it is added to your budget.   Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will  review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully  this helps you some.

beck-s	 To All Employees:  This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:  -- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.   -- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.  -- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.  -- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.  These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.  As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.  For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.  I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.  When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.  On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

beck-s	 Julie,  Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.  Vince  ************************************  Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.  1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture the same type of market evolution of prices over time. 2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during different time slots represent different economic commodities. Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2 (article number 3).    - aus_2_3.doc

beck-s	 The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.   Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the  hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.   Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at  the ASE.  Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since  arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own  devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday  night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the  ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently,  Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.

beck-s	 Vince and John,  I wanted to send you a quick note and once again say thank you for attending  the Cal Berkeley presentation last week.  I am sorry for the low attendance  on campus, however I did want to send some refreshing news.  I just received  the resumes of students who would like to interview with Enron.

beck-s	 Darren, plan is to have the necessary contracts in place under the new NETCO name so we can do business on all key pipes. Regarding the Intrastates I suggest you think about the key ones so we have them on the list and get basic contracts in place once we have a new name and parent. Also what services you want on each so we get all the necessary contracts done.   I'll get you some budget info shortly, tks - Bob   -----Original Message----- From:

I  realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but  it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some  of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349.  The agenda will be as follows:  12:00 - 1:00 Lunch 1:00 - 3:30   Presentations 3:30 - to close  Discussion  RAC/Research Presentations  The following topics would be of interest to EES:  1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)  - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,  - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for  Enron,  - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect  to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.  2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for  the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)  - - the selection of curves  - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and  - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.  3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these  figures derived? (RAC)  4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to  accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)  - - promotion payments,  - - accounts receivable  - - committed capital  - - and other factors    EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes,  however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more  fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us.  Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed  models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or  Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go  through the process of how the various pieces are put together.

beck-s	 FERC Acts To Remove Obstacles to Address Western Energy Crisis  **Omnibus order mobilizes FERC's entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority **To adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities **Streamlines regulation of wholesale market, energy facilities siting and  licensing **Promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand-response bidding **Order doesn't address price caps **Meeting with Western state regulators/officials set for April 6, 2001 in  Boise, Idaho  FERC moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed California and Western energy markets.  FERC proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the West by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification, licensing, and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce.  FERC quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity, as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions, as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines.  The order, which sets new  precedent in its broadness, also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the West as well as promoting the necessary wholesale-market  portion of demand-response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side.  FERC asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by March 30, 2001.  Effective immediately, FERC said in a statement, *the Commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales,  expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into California  and the West, including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications, and urging all licensees to review  their FERC-licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity.*  Among the actions FERC takes are to: 1) require the California ISO and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the Western Systems Coordinating  Council (WSCC) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term; 2) waive prior notice requirements for any on-site or  self-generators that sell at wholesale within the WSCC area; 3) grant blanket  market-based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand-response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads; and 4) broadening and extending  through December  31, 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities (QFs) to increase the availability of generating  capacity.  FERC seeks comments by March 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid, including an  increased rate of return on equity (ROE) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either June 1, 2001, or  November 1, 2001.  Other areas that FERC requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the Federal Power Act, and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction.  On hydro issues, FERC requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at FERC-licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources.  In its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure, FERC  asked for comments - again by March 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the Western interconnection, including the  increased ROE for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001.   Increased ROE, FERC said, will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by June 1, 2002, or November 1,  2002.  FERC seeks comment on a proposed 10-year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short-term and a 15-year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights-of-way that can be of  service by November 1, 2002.  In his dissent to the order, Commissioner Massey argued the order focuses on  "quick fixes," and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in California.  The order also "fails to address price relief," noted  Massey.  Massey also called for a full Federal Power Act (FPA) Section 206  investigation of California issues, which would allow for the possibility of  refunds.  On transmission incentive provisions, Massey lamented that the  proposed ROE increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  FERC policy under Order No. 2000.  The financial provisions, he said,  appeared to be "just throwing money at the problem."   While generally  disappointed with the order, Massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order.  Many of the suggestions in the order are the "same  actions as authorized last May," said Massey.  "They were good ideas then,  and they are good ideas now," he concluded.  For his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted,  Chairman Hebert said the order was designed to "squeeze every additional MW  of supply available" and to encourage the conservation of MW, and stressed  that FERC is "doing all it can in its power to alleviate Western problems."   He said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  California, but noted that generation/transmission siting, and conservation  are generally state issues.  FERC's *removing obstacles* order is posted on its web site at: http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower/EL01-47-000.pdf  Citation: FERC issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western United States and asking for  comments was issued on March 14, 2001, Docket No. EL01-47-000.  A detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows:  Electric Transmission Infrastructure  Within 30 days, the California ISO and transmission owners in WSCC are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way.  FERC proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by July 1, 2001 would receive a  cost-based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10-year depreciable life.  Projects in service by November 1, 2001, would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10-year depreciable life.  FERC would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in WSCC of 11.5%, based on the ROE FERC approved for Southern  California Edison.  System upgrades that involve new rights of way, add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by November 1, 2002, would get a cost-based  rate reflecting 12.5% ROE, or a100 basis point premium, and 15-year  depreciable life.  Facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid, which go into  service as required to accommodate the in-service date of the new plant would  get a cost-based rate that reflected a 13.5% ROE, or a 200 basis point  premium, if in service by November 1, 2001 and 12.5% ROE if in service by  November 1, 2002.  For increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments, for example, installing new  technology, FERC proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional MW of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point-to-point rate.  FERC requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply, or  alternatively, to roll these costs into the average system rate.  Extension of Waivers for QFs  FERC proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for QFs - applicable throughout WSCC - to allow increased  generation through December 31, 2001.  The waivers were to expire on April  30, 2001.  The proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility.  The waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in WSCC with respect to their fuel use requirements  under FERC regulation section 292.204(b), would be extended to December 31,  2001.  Additional Capacity From On-Site Generation  FERC will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within WSCC.  Through December 31,  2001, owners of generating facilities located at business locations in WSCC  and used primarily for back-up or self- generation who would become subject  to FPA by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under FPA section 205.  FERC also authorizes  such power to be sold at market-based rates.   FERC waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales.  Quarterly reporting is  required.  Allows Demand Response Bidding  FERC will allow retail customers, as permitted by state law, and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale.  FERC is granting blanket authorization, consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on-site generation and requires  similar reporting.  FERC's December 15 order on the California market directed, as a longer-term  measure that the ISO pursue establishing an integrated day-ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue.  FERC seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this.  FERC says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal, commercial, technical and  regulatory issues.  Safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand-response bidding programs.  Intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs.   Requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales.  Contract Modifications for Demand-Response Bidding  There may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand-response arrangements with their wholesale customers.  As for mutually  agreeable QF interconnections, FERC will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand-response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements.  Clarifies that  demand-response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs.  Interconnections  FPA section 210(d) allows FERC to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order: 1) is in the public interest; 2) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital, optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources, or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies; and 3) meets the requirements of FPA section 212.  FERC requests comments on whether it can use this authority under FPA section  210(d) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load.  If  the exercise of this authority may be warranted, FERC seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the WSCC  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action.  Longer Term Regional Solutions  FERC believes an RTO for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of Western RTOs is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long-term regional solution.  Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity  FERC has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve California and the West.  Requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis, including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $10 million, and for prior  notice authorizations to $30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to California; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems.  Hydroelectric Power  FERC staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation.  Requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  Commission-licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources.   Comments should consider: 1) methods for agency involvement; 2) ways to  handle and expedite Endangered Species Act consultations; 3) criteria for  modifying licenses; and 4) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades.  Oil Pipelines  FERC will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the California market.  Conference with State Commissioners  FERC will hold a one-day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from Western states to discuss price volatility in the West  as well as other FERC-related issues identified by the Governors of Western  states.  By notice issued March 16, this meeting is scheduled for April 6,  2001 in Boise, Idaho.  [Source: FERC 03/14/01 order, Docket EL01-47-000, and news release.]  - TEXT.htm

beck-s	 Mon, 18 Sep 2000 18:42:47  Your  subscription to  the FRBNYRMAG1  list (Federal  Reserve Bank  of NY Research Publications) has been accepted.  Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below. Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcome messages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list.  To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list, just  send  mail  to   FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM.  This  is  called "sending mail to the list," because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV  makes copies  for  all  the people  who  have subscribed.  This address  (FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM)  is   also  called  the  "list address." You must never  try to send any command to  that address, as it would be distributed to all the  people who have subscribed. All commands must be sent to the "LISTSERV address," LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. It is  very important  to understand  the  difference between  the two,  but fortunately it  is not complicated.  The LISTSERV  address is like  a FAX number that connects you to a machine, whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting  you to a person. If you  make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted  to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly  realize that you used  the wrong number and  call again. No harm will have been done. If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call  someone's voice  line, the  person receiving  the call  will be inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The fact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to the voice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop does not mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number. People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way with mailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  or thousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect a lot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the list address.  You may  leave the  list at  any time by  sending a  "SIGNOFF FRBNYRMAG1" command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. You  can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to  confirm the receipt of messages you send  to the list. If you do  not trust the system,  send a "SET FRBNYRMAG1  REPRO" command and LISTSERV will send you  a copy of your own messages, so  that you can see that the  message was  distributed and  did not get  damaged on  the way. After a while  you may find that this is  getting annoying, especially if your mail program does not tell you  that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from FRBNYRMAG1. If you send a "SET FRBNYRMAG1  ACK  NOREPRO"  command,  LISTSERV   will  mail  you  a  short acknowledgement  instead,  which  will  look different  in  your  mailbox directory. With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an  acknowledgement  you  can  read  later. Finally,  you  can  turn  off acknowledgements completely with "SET FRBNYRMAG1 NOACK NOREPRO".  Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a list  of the  available archive  files by  sending an  "INDEX FRBNYRMAG1" command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. You  can then order these files with a  "GET FRBNYRMAG1  LOGxxxx" command,  or using  LISTSERV's database search facilities. Send  an "INFO DATABASE" command  for more information on the latter.  IMPORTANT: This list is confidential. You should not publicly mention its existence, or forward copies of information  you have obtained from it to third  parties. Please  note  that the  "GIVE"  command is  automatically disabled for all archive files.  More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  REFCARD" command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM.

This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the E-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a "winner" when the shakeout hits, full-force.  Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emerging markets.  An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.  As competition intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.  Few eCommerce markets--whether e-tailing online exchanges or others---will be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts.  This conference will combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with the latest thinking about the unique features of E-commerce, to identify successful strategies for surviving a shakeout.  Questions to be addressed include:  - Are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets applicable to eCommerce?  What are the early warning signs of an impending shakeout?  - Which eCommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout?  Will there be single or multiple winners?  - Which companies are likely to survive?  What strategies will the winners  use?  There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most contribute to prospects for survival.  How important are first mover advantages and building brand equity?  What do incumbents have to do to prevail?  Which business models are most robust?  How important is the ability to manage strategic partnerships?  These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia and Wall Street.  _____________________________________  AGENDA  ************************************* DINNER & REGISTRATION - THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19  5:30 - 6:30p Registration and Reception  6:30 - 9:00p Dinner  SURVIVING THE SHAKEOUT: FUNDAMENTALS, FADS AND THE FUTURE (John Hagel of 12 Entrepreneuring; co-author of the best-selling books NET GAIN and NET WORTH)  ************************************* CONFERENCE - RIDAY, OCTOBER 20  8:00 - 8:30a  Continental Breakfast & Informal Networking  8:30 - 9:15 INTRODUCTION: UNDERSTANDING THE BOOM AND BUST OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (George Day, Co-Director of the Mack Center for Technological Innovation and Boisi Professor of Marketing, the Wharton School and co-editor of WHARTON ON MANAGING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES)  9:15-10:00 APPLYING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST TO THE eCOMMERCE FUTURE (Adam Fein, President, Pembroke Consulting)  10:00-10:30  BREAK  10:30-11:30 IDENTIFYING WINNING AND LOSING INTERNET BUSINESS MODELS (Raffi Amit, Goergen Professor of Entrepreneurship and Director, Wharton E-Business Initiative (WEBI); and David Reibstein, Woodside Prof. of Marketing, Wharton School and Director, Marketing Science Institute)  11:30-12:15p TECHNOLOGY INVESTING, 15 THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TRUE (Stephen J.

beck-s	 Per discussions that hopefully most of you have or will have with your  respective managers, you have been selected to be a part of a team to address  various issues associated with reconciling and clearing 1999 UA4.  The scope  of the team will be to work as a team, on production months where the UA4  number per our accounting systems is considerably larger in comparison to  what the pipeline balancing reports has as unaccounted for.  This team will  be dedicated fully to this effort and will need to be prepared to contribute  whatever hours are needed to get the desired results.  Yvette will be  locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week.  This  room will be a "war room".  Everyone is expected to report to the "war room"  on a daily basis and should expect to be there unless something EXTREMELY  pressing causes you to have to leave or people need to go back to their  offices to retrieve data or information.  The expectations are that this  group will work to identify any volume discrepancies, adjustments, etc. and  be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no  later than Mar. 24, 2000.  This team is effective as of tomorrow, Mar. 16,  2000 at 9:00 a.m.    Yvette- please try to locate a room by then and notify the above team members  of the location.  In the case that you are not able to find a room right  away, please have everyone go to Brenda's office in EB3748 at 9:00 a.m.  The items on the radar screen to address in resolving volume issues are:  1.  King Ranch 2.  Gulf Plains Plant 3.  Gulf Energy Imbalance 4.  Hanover Treaters 5.  South Texas Treaters 6.  Tejas Gas P/L Imbalance 7.  Channel A/S Line Unaccounted For 8.

Vince/Kim:  I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license, and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that direction after he handed it to you.  Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development, gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades, bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs.  I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more successful, and I look forward to working with you.  We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May 1.)

beck-s	 Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers  Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:  National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).    The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected:  1.
beck-s	 Kevin,   the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can  deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the  memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to  know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.   You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that  setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some  template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template  for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the  results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.  Vasant

beck-s	 Shona -  To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template  was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group  is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your  request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised  reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until  you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L  notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday  should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should  help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business  unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.  Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation  explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that  commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is  responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the  commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops  for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these  explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit  controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance  obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit  controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback  (as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like  me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just  let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their  explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long  and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and  should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based  on the market moves, etc..   Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.  Regards, Cassandra.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron on 12/07/2000  09:48 AM ---------------------------

I certainly  appreciate the value-added that you provide in your research.I had a quick  question for you regarding any anticipated Japan central bank intervention at  the 15,000 level in the Nikkei. If I am understanding the mechanism correctly, BIS reserve requirements fall  below certain threshold and banks can no longer lend money and meet BIS  lending criteria due to improper reserve base. And this roughly happens at  15,000 level?  Reason I ask is Goldman Sachs put out an article suggesting that  break-evenpoint for bank holding of stocks is roughly 12,000-12,500 a  different index level than the one you have mentioned.    I can appreciate the difference between reserve liquidity and actual  break-even on equity positions, but just wanted to clarify this point with  you, as we are trying to gain a complete understanding of how a trigger would  effect Japanese capital markets. And so, as I currently understand it, there  are (2 ) trigger levels to watch:  15,000 where banks fail BIS criteria and hence cannot extend new loans with  BIS stamp of approval. Clearly ctl bank would have incentive in restoring  this or else financial system would be thrown into turmoil.  12500 where banks begin to take an actual loss on equity holdings  Is this right?    Thanks Maureen, take care, Darren  
beck-s	 Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John     Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince    John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the  Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.  I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far  away).  Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you  please let me know where you stand now?  I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.  Look forward to connecting with you Vince.  John     
beck-s	 Hi Iris  We started off with about 105 companies, which were Enron Europe's UK power  and gas desk counterparties. I'm not sure where you got the figure of 500  from - maybe this is the entire Enron Europe counterparty list, which  constitutes the next major effort for end-July.  From this list of 104, only the 72 in the spreadsheet had information in  Amadeus. The other firms had no information available, most likely because  they were too new.

It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such  counterparties.  However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72  of these European counterparties.   Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400+ other  counterparties?

beck-s	 In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.  Stack Manager Changes  Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.  In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.  Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.  Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.  In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.  Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.   Website Changes  New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.    The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box.   Price of Limit Orders   Modify Limit Orders  Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.  Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.  Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.  Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.  In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.  Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.   Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.  If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

beck-s	 Vince Thanks for the quick response.  Agree on #5  just bear in mind it says SCOPE  not implement so it is more of a development of a project. RE; MG I will keep Tanya apprised of travel plans and give her the option to  be in or out as you two see fit.

My understanding is that currently we are  receiving the positions aggregated to a daily level.  Also, I talked to Tanya about visiting MG in New York. She is leaving for  vacation on the 26th of July  and can go for a day to NYC prior to this date.  I think that it makes a lot of sense for her to visit MG and to kick the tires. I asked her to coordinate the trip with you: it makes sense for both of you to go together. I may join you depending on my availability.

beck-s	 Dear Ms. Beck,  A couple weeks ago I sent you a letter and resume regarding the possibility of a summer internship.  As I know how easy it is for things to get lost in email, I am sending them again.  The letter follows and the resume is attached.  If this job position will not work out or if I should contact someone else, please let me know.  I will also try to call you to follow-up within the next two days. Thanks you for your time.  Sincerely, Natalie Carnes  **************************************************************************** ***********************************  Dear Ms. Beck,  I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.  As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective. This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer, I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.  I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world. The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you!  Sincerely,  Natalie Carnes  - Resume4.doc 
beck-s	 Hi Sheridan,  How are you?  I hope that you had a good vacation.  Vasant and I looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting.    I shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose.  The comments follow.   Finally, I shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model.  It appears that you are proposing a state-space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified.  The next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points.  Traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project.  Also, you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node.  Thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward.   If some  of these values turn out to be negative, zero-coupon, risk-free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization.   Next, we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project (based on the variance of the returns) .  We iterate until  convergence.  Finally, we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the PV of the gross cash flows (including debt) to determine if the  project merits further consideration.  Comments/Clarifications  1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of  nature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk  capital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm  anymore.  2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a  project with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity.  3.  It seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate, which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the  variances).  It is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence.  Also,  our project has a finite life and the market-based assets will have infinite  lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant variance?   Is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment?  4.  Finally, our criterion is to subtract from the average PV the investment  and also the risk capital.  Setting risk capital to zero, this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate.    Gas Field Case  To facilitate your thinking, we are providing a gas field example below.  We invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field.  A profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning.  Production will be autocorrelated, as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves.   We assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value.  There are fixed and variable operating costs.   It might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem.  Do let me know if you have further questions.  Rakesh 
beck-s	 After meeting with AEP this morning, some issues are revolved and new one  added.  Resolved:   Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals,  intramonth transactions  will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.   Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.   The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.   Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back  into Sitara.  The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.  New items   A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains.  AEP/Enron evaluating options.   New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP.  Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.   Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.   All items on the Energy ops issues list were discussed.  AEP to fill in point  person for there side.   Agreement reached to use this format and add items as needed.  I will issue a revised transitions issues list tomorrow afternoon, after my  energy ops meeting.

THOUGH SHE'S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED, AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE. GET THIS:  CBS will be forced to discontinue "Touched by an Angel" for using the word God in every program. Madeline Murray O'Hare, an atheist, successfully managed to eliminate the use of Bible reading from public schools a few years ago. Now her organization has been granted a  Federal Hearing on the same subject by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, DC. Their petition, Number 2493,  would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of the gospel our Lord and Savior, and the airwaves of America.  They got 287,000 signatures to back their stand! If this attempt is successful, all Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will be stopped. This group is also campaigning to remove all Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools!! You as a Christian can help!  We are praying for at least 1 million signatures. This would defeat their effort and how that there are many Christians alive, well and concerned about our country. As christians we must unite on this.  Please don't take this lightly. We ignored this lady once and lost prayer in our school and in offices across the nation.  Please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard. Together we can make a  difference in our country while creating an opportunity for the lost to know the Lord.

Could you, please, advise me what is the best hotel where we could stay  overnight, close to your location?

beck-s	 Grant,  I agree. We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice. I think we extended a very  generous offer to him and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to Enron.  Vince        
beck-s	 Clem--- The trader said this deal needed to be renegotiated, and I am waiting  to hear what happened....I sent him an email today to remind him that I need  an answer a.s.a.p......I'll let you know as soon as I hear.  Thanks, Mark x33396     Clem Cernosek@ECT 01/09/2001 12:09 PM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mark McCoy/Corp/Enron@Enron, Edward Terry/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: HPL Meter #985892 South Katy Gas Unit No. 2 #1  Daren:  During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's  pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and  Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under  contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective  11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934;  Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000.   Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL  Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either  (1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000,  (2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs  approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Print,  sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).    ______________________________________________  Deal/Deal Ticket#/Customer (Buyer/Seller)      OR    _________________________________________________________  APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss   In addition,  since Deal #466305 expires on 11/30/2000 and gas is still  flowing, Logistics needs either (1) Deal #466305 extended, or (2) a new deal  to cover December 2000 and any other future months that this production is  flowing into HPL's pipeline.    _____________  New Deal #    Thanks, Clem

beck-s	 Ted,  We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many  thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to  validate some  inputs before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both  London and Houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.  A few comments.  1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston  (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs. The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to  multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).  2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated  positions and prices on a regular basis.  3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:   a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its  portfolios. This is the liquidity risk        resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the  underlying positions.  b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating  the position numbers (i.e. look                       into the details of specific transactions).  From what  I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk        management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option  prices (and deltas). They get some                       option prices by calling brokers.  4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the  inputs are right). But, as I have said,      VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.  Vince

beck-s	 The following comes to mind:  Describe the inputs to VAR and the sources of the inputs Discuss Enron's timing of running the VAR calculation Explain the diversification effect Explain that only Officialized books are included in the VAR calculation Explain how Enron uses the VAR for risk measurement, portfolio performance  analysis, individual trader analysis Address Risk Policy limits related to VAR A comparison of Enron's risk appetite, measured in VAR, vs. other financial  companies would be interesting How does Enron'e use of VAR as a risk measurement tool compare with our  competitors? Explain why the VAR engine would have different positions than our benchmark  reports. Discuss Component VAR Discuss useful analyses Enron can implement utilizing VAR (Sharpe ratio, VAR  efficiency, etc.)  Hope this helps, Mike

beck-s	 Thanks for the update.    No point in pushing Andrew back though, that's the point of an audit.  Louise     To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron, Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron, Sally  Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Status - "PCG wish list"  I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list.    We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our  list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous  occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think  primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a  lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date.   Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier  a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob  Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.    My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be  re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the  PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the  list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start  and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push  Andrew back as far as possible!    Please let me know if you have any questions -   Sheri  
beck-s	 Vince, for your use as per our discussions  - - - Mike ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT on 12/09/2000=20 10:32 AM ---------------------------   =20 =09 =09 =09From:  Mike A Roberts                           12/09/2000 10:33 AM =09  To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: =20 Subject: Stephen Bennett   Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research=20 group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment= =20 criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as = a=20 Senior Specialist.  After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly = an=20 "under hire."  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more = of=20 a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of= =20 this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20 error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "promotion.= "  At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20 designated as "Professional Meteorologist."  In fact, the most recent simil= ar=20 hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist= ,=20 who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While= =20 functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20 classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20 professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20 proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin= al=20 uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20 category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected= =20 at this time.  Although a "new-hire" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20 experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20 Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20 Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20 needing no further training and only minimal supervision.  Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro= n=20 values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20 responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager= =20 level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather= =20 briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio= n=20 as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly= =20 briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a= =20 master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20 other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.  Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  = He=20 designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research= =20 web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather= =20 derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and= =20 liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion= =20 and major upgrade of this web page.  These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg= ular=20 duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail= ,=20 to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.  Recently, with the= =20 advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntaril= y=20 on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As hi= s=20 supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I d= o=20 not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations=20 assistance.  In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was= =20 Enron=01,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - = a=20 meteorologist, coupled with Stephen=01,s desire to work for our company in = spite=20 of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professiona= l=20 title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly= =20 demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving= =20 of this immediate and retroactive promotion.

As we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11/3 we currently have nine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11/3, we probably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currently holding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this is like a game of dominos).  However, Enron could interview off campus, but that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the employer.  If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11/3 for just Comp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.  Our Recruiting Coordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work for Enron.  Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know what their preferences are.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000  Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn't know the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don't have time to look it up.)  Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband's cell phone (512) 657-1555  You can always try Cara's cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn't really figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you'll probably have better luck leaving a message at the hotel.  Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at 4:25 P.M.  Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas.usta.com

beck-s	 PRC Representatives Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are  the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:     As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts)  and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is  essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct  a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The  pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and  available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a  secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts  feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or  Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.   The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the  completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system  is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your  Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated  correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are  unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or  Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.  Supervisors You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the  Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate  this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at  your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not  conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the  rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.   Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at  x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to  provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have  been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final  cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are  responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be  representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind  that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will  ensure that the final PRC is a success.  Associates/Analysts You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received  your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this,  please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system  and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many  people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your  reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of  reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will  also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the  opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you  have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may  hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do  not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.    An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000  at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and  Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be  communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be  communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the  Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should  contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly  Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a  successful final PRC

In addition to traditional Analyst recruiting focusing on  Finance, Economics, and Business majors, the Analyst program will add a new  addition to it's rotational program - The Global Technology Track.

Therefore, we would like to create a recruiting team  that represents all aspects of Enron including both IT and Business "swat  teams" to help attack campus during career fairs, presentations, dinners, and  other events searching for the ideal candidate.    In the next week you will receive an invitation to the Cal Berkeley Planning  Session and Kickoff.  At that time we will review strategies, profiles, and  events to ensure that Enron is able to attract the top candidates!  Please  make every effort to attend.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 3-3589.  Thanks,  Ashley Baxter Global Technology Track Recruiter

beck-s	 Please increase deliveries into Eastrans from HPL to 20,000 MMBtu/dy effective 5/9/01.  The redeliveries will be 17,000 MMBtu/dy from Fuels Cotton Valley and 3,000 MMBtu/dy into PG&E at Carthage Tailgate.  Also note:  On 5/9/01, actual deliveries from Fuels Cotton Valley into HPL will be larger than the nomination of 17,000 MMBtu/dy.  This is occuring because the other outlet from Fuels Cotton Valley is down for maintenance. On 5/10/01, actual deliveries will be less than the nomination of 17,000 MMBtu/dy in order to balance the nomination versus deliveries from 5/9/01. No over-delivery or under-delivery charges per the Transaction Agreement will apply during this two-day period.

beck-s	 Chris,  E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather  group.  Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense  for Research to charge his expenses to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to  different sub-units of GM.  Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London  with Mike Roberts. We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

Exxon's issue is that  the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for  transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to  PGE.     Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:   1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line  attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.  2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis  elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects  to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.  3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco  can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes.   4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate  the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue  to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must  pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.  Solution:  1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884  that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.  2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL  Meter #986884.   3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset  volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.  4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack  Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.  If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please  let me know at X-36650.  Thanks, Clem

beck-s	 Neil,  You must have already gotten my earlier mail of clarification.  Going  forward, I agree with you that we should start the assigment early rather  than late.  However, I would not necessarily like to wait till even Feb 5.  The bids for  LNG must go out by the 15th of Feb, and we need to do a lot of fuel based  analysis before then.  Hence, if it is possible for Anshuman ot be available  before then, I would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps even as early as Monday  or Tuesday if possible ??  Regards, Sandeep.

We have a significant  resource problem here in India, given we have a renegotiation about fall in  our laps. Anshuman is one of our key analysts and we are very proud of his  abilities and future potential for Enron. Once we have Dabhol off the "life  support system" we could look at a longer assignment. As far as the present  one month assignment is concerned, I would rather go for an early start say  5th Feb till 5th March. Is this convenient to you and Jeff.

We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep every few days).  Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request).

Vince      Tom Arnold <tmarnol@lsu.edu> on 04/25/2001 09:15:09 AM To: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com cc:   Subject: Potential Prospect   Hey Vince,  Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion.  I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course. However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.  This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?  His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.  Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much.  Tom Professor Tom Arnold E.J.

beck-s	 Paul,  Vince and I spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the  trading analytics.   There is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a  two day time period.   I think a reasonable start would be the following:  1.  Obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been  implemented in order to verify profitability, and P/L volatility of each. 2.  Review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare  these to projections for trading income. 3.  Review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a  change of ownership would not have adverse consequences, i.e. are there  guarantees of continued access using the current systems? 4.  Review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets?   It is far from  clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the  current limited "electronic" liquidity. 5.  Review, at least qualitatively, the current trading strategies being  used.   Try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these  strategies will disappear as other's implement similar trading models.   What  is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage. 6.  Review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will  be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and  outdated. 7.  Try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading  technology to Enron's other markets, given the illiquidity of these markets  as compared to the financial equity markets.  If there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis, we would  probably want to run their system on a test set of data.  Let me know if you have other suggestions.  --Stinson

beck-s	 The mapping problem mentioned below is a power desk problem only.  The  mapping problem is purely between the interface of the gas and power trading  systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas trader's gas  book.  There was one instance when a gas trader's transactions were  incorrectly bridged to a power trader's gas book through EOL.  The root of  this problem was with the EOL bridge not the interface mapping.  The procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication  to IT regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book.  If for some  reason the mapping does not occur, the position will be mapped to a 'dummy'  default desk.  We will be alerted when positions are loaded to the 'dummy'  account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure  that positions do no get lost in the system.    If anyone needs to further discuss the problem we have been having and why it  is only the power world that is affected, please give me a call.    Thanks, Stacey (3-1870)

beck-s	 Notes for this Week's Report:  *  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal  count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately  2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.  *  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily  EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in  November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from  714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has  decreased steadily in December.  *  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by  about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the  average daily EOL volume has decreased about 40% since November.  However,  the average daily Non-EOL deal count has only decreased by about 10% since  November, from 88 to 79 deals per day.  *  US West Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 71%  since November, from 187 to 54 deals per day.  However, the average daily  Non-EOL Deal Count has decreased by only about 21% since November, from 171  to 136 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume has  remained steady.  *  US East Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 24%  since November, from 167 to 127 deals per day.  However, the average daily  Non-EOL Deal Count has actually increased by about 3% since November, from  230 to 237 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume  has increased by about 20% total.  These recent trends in Power may indicate  a shift in on-line power transactions from EOL to our competitors.  *  LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in  September, 398 in October, to 444 in November.  In December,  LPG's appear to  have levelled off with 449 deals completed in December.  The total monthly  EOL volumes have increased similarly as well.  *  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.   The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total  in October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for December was only about 83%  of the total in November.  *  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 47% since  November, from a daily average of 242 to a daily average of 357 for December.  --------------- The following files contain a graphical view of the average deal count and  volumes per month by Commodity for EOL and OTC transactions since the launch  of EnronOnline.

The US energy major says that the Godbole committee=01,s suggest= ions=20 were unacceptable. In response to a query from ET, the company said in a=20 statement that the  =01&published terms of the Godbole report do not repres= ent=20 an acceptable basis for further discussions.=018  The statement said that i= t=20 would be meeting the committee next week as =01&a matter of courtesy=018. = =01&Since=20 the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei= r=20 thoughts, we will not present any proposals,=018 the statement said. Accord= ing=20 to highly-placed sources in the government, the company has informed the=20 Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May 11. Earlier reports ha= d=20 indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May 5.=20  According to sources, Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives= =20 of its lenders and shareholders. The Godbole committee, that studied the=20 current power purchase agreement, has called for cancellation of the presen= t=20 tariff structure, renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract, removal o= f=20 dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned, deb= t=20 restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power=20 purchase agreement. These suggestions, it seems, may not be acceptable to= =20 Enron. The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole= =20 committee to renegotiate. The committee has been given a month=01,s time to= =20 renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA.  The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of 5 mmpta is far in= =20 excess of what is required by the plant (only 2.1 mmpta of which 1.8 mmpta = is=20 on take or pay), it should be separated into a distinct facility whose=20 capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge, not as take or pa= y.=20 It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow= er=20 generation. Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF.= =20 Instead, the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro= n=01, s own Metgas. =01&It is important to distribute the cost over the entire=20 capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant,=018 says the=20 committee. Similarly, it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the= =20 harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers. On the LNG= =20 contract negotiated by Enron for long-term supplies, it has said that since= =20 the LNG market has witnessed great changes, particularly as far as prices a= re=20 concerned, the power company should take advantage of spot buys and=20 renegotiate the contract accordingly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday, May 04, 2001=20 Enron ready to take part in PPA talk ,  Nitin Yeshwantrao  The Enron management has finally agreed to  participate in a 'discussion'= =20 with the Madhav Godbole-led re-negotiation committee set-up to facilitate= =20 the  restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the= =20 US power major and the state government.Officials of Dabhol Power Company= =20 (DPC), a subsidiary of Enron, alongwith their team of shareholders and =20 lenders will arrive here on May 11 for talks with the  nine-member Godbole= =20 panel.Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation, a k= ey=20 Mantralaya official told The times of  India that the team had expressed=20 willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the=20 imbroglio.  Enron's response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the= =20 controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks, with the board of= =20 directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a=20 termination notice to MSEB. The state government, on its part, too adopted = a=20 confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 crore rebate charge on DPC fo= r=20 defaulting on power supply.However, the sudden change of heart by the Enron= =20 management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le= d=20 by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) which had recently opposed t= he=20 move to pull out of the project. This was in contradiction to the stand tak= en=20 by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes= =20 on disbursement of funds to DPC. The Congress-led Democratic Front governme= nt=20 had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to=20 renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o= f=20 both the parties.  Last week, the state government constituted a nine-member panel of experts= =20 under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole. Godbole had written to the DPC=20 management inviting it for talks to re-negotiate the PPA on May 5. For the= =20 delayed response from Enron, the meeting has been rescheduled to May 11.The= =20 issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the= =20 LNG facility from the power plant, renegotiating LNG supply and shipping=20 agreements, redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a two-part=20 tariff. The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar=20 denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra=20 government to sell power to third parties. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, May 04, 2001,=20 DPC team to appear before Godbole panel on May 11=20  A battery of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials and foreign lenders will= =20 appear before the Madhav Godbole renegotiations committee on May 11 =01&as = a=20 matter of courtesy,and not for presenting any proposals.=018Simultaneously,=  the=20 DPC has made it clear that the published terms of the Godbole report do not=   =20 represent an acceptable basis for further discussions.

Based on feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required.

beck-s	 Stinson,  Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.    You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the "Business Conduct" and  "Drug Policy" language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.      Bonnie 
beck-s	 In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how  it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the  credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk  are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a  reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses  RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key  problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made  by risk management groups.  differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many  of your ba's don't.  when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be  officialized market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market  risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we  make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.  how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized  it does not pick the book up. Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it  picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are  moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the  previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer  used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit  will pick up 0 on a go forward basis. Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names. Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the  counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names  need to be used so they flow properly to credit.  what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions  not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info. As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names  are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first  day it has 0 positions.  If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at  X35856.

beck-s	 Vince,  Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read  it once before I forward it for internal approval?

beck-s	 To the great and powerful Research Group:  As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1. We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial  credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of  market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick  Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The  questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.   We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a  long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee  and announced the upgrade.    I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and  will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they  will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well  as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk,  operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.  Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.  Ted  p.s. - there is still lots of interesting opportunities to extend the  paradigm

He will probably need to come in the night before (the 16th) and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.

The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is: 713-654-1234.  He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them to me and I will have a check cut.

beck-s	 I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the  call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying to  conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I  mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me  compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to  quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent  information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in  many extra hours to help us out on this project.  I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.  Regards,  Craig  
beck-s	 We have scheduled a user test for Clickpaper on Saturday, July 22nd starting  at 8:30 AM on the 29th floor of the Enron building.    First, a reminder to Edward and Bob to make sure the ENA Paper group is here  (commercial only plus, at a minimum, John Jacobson).  It is up to Edward and  Bob to decide if London personnel should be here but I would recommend a  few.  They will be the "users" in the test.  We will have a script for them.   The goal is to test the site and the capability of the trading floor.  I will  explain more about this to Edward and Bob next week.  Also, Bill Bradford or his designee from credit needs to be here to review  the functionality of the credit check.  Also, Ted Murphy or his designee  needs to be here to review control.  If the test is a success, we will wipe the system clean Saturday and will  create actual customer profiles we have received in the system on Sunday.   Monday we will review everything one last time for Tuesday launch, July 25th  launch.  We will provide lunch for everyone so get to me the names of who is committed  so I can plan.  Please respond with any issues or questions.  Thanks.  GP

DAGOGO KALU TEL/FAX 448453342783  ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO  REQUEST FOR AN ASSISTANCE  Dear Sir,  With due respect and knowledge of your good reputation, I decided to contact you for this matter that need urgent attention.  I am COL. DAGOGO KALU.  I was the commandant of the West African Peace keeping Force & Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) until I sustained a very serious injury that put me off the military camp for about 3 months now.  Honestly, I have full trust for your honesty hence I write this letter to you.  During our recent mission to Sierra Leone, a diamond rich West African country to cushion the war between the rebels and the ruling Government, we ran into 2 boxes (consignment) right inside a thick jungle where we believed was a hide out of the rebels.  As we opened the boxes, one that is smaller contains numerous sizes of raw diamond.  The Bigger box contains about US $15.2 Million, which we believed to be the total amount of diamond sold at that period of time by the rebels before we invaded the place.  Myself and my two other colleagues took the boxes away.  I took the bigger box containing the US $15.2 million to Cotonou Benin Republic which is the nearby country and deposited it with one Security Company for safe keeping to enable me think wisely on what to do with the money.  The smaller box containing the raw diamond I gave it to my other 2 colleagues, which they accepted in good faith.  A month after this, the rebels lunched a counter-attack on us where I sustained a very serious gun shut wound on my right leg.  A lot of our boys died but few survived.  At this moment, I am receiving medical treatment here in London.  This is why I need your help urgently.  I need a Foreign Company I will present as the Beneficiary of the huge amount and also pay in the money into their account.  Your Bank account must be a good one where we shall not pay much as tax.  You shall also serve as the general overseer and guardian of this fund and all the investment of this money will be under your care until I recover fully.  I will give you all the details of the transaction immediately I get your response.  You will also get a suitable percentage (%) as your share.  All the documents of the DEPOSIT OF THE MONEY are intact with my wife.  I have already finalized this arrangement with the Security Company so there is no problem at all.  Please you can reach me through my Direct Tel/Fax No: 448453342783 where I am receiving treatment.  In your reply, state clearly your direct telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and more confidentiality.  Further details will be given to you once I hear from you. I await your urgent response soonest. Best regards, COL.

beck-s	 Molly:  for your information, I received this reply from Anshuman today.  As I mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from Neil  McGregor, there is no possible way that Anshuman could be in the US to work  on February 5th.  Until I receive all of his documents, and the necessary  information from you regarding his position in the US, I do not have the  information to send to the attorneys for the visa application.  Once they receive the paperwork, they will need to prepare the documents in  triplicate, and send to me.  At this stage, I will send the documents to  Anshuman in India and he will need to make an appointment at the US Consulate  in order to have the L1 visa stamped into his passport.  He will not be able  to come to the States to work without this visa in his passport!  All of this  could take approx. 3-4 weeks to accomplish.  I think March would be a more  realistic timeframe!  Please let me have your thoughts. Thanks  Margaret   ---------------------- Forwarded by Margaret Daffin/HOU/ECT on 01/25/2001  09:45 AM ---------------------------

beck-s	 I have reviewed the Entex actuals and adjusted Gas Control's Entex factor for  the month of May.  I have found that Entex estimates have been overstated by  approximately 10.0 Mmcf/Day.

The attached file has the changes that need to be made.  Please let everyone  on this mailing list know once the changes have been made.    If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

beck-s	 Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.  We will discuss  this issue tomorrow.  Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new  version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting  list to get into  IT group's door.  Currently, they are struggling with the  Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the "Prudency"  model after the "Credit" and before anything else.  So, it's uncertain when  they can begin these two projects.  Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major  difference exist between the new and old versions: 1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full  evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the  "Spread option" and "Swaption" evaluation.  I am working with them on it. 2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.  Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the  new version with the current one.  Thanks.  Vincent

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk  September 15, 2000 Raymond Cote Vice  President, FinRad Inc.  Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a  Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that  combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and  financial institutions.  Abstract:  Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little  attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank  liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After  introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a  framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then  shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools  leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers  concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement  framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Though the controversial multinati= onal has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), info= rmed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light & Power and others=  to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the best cours= e for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force m= ajeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly=  weaken its case. The committee points out that the many "infirmities" in t= he DPC approval process brings into question the "propriety of the decision= s".   It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India's policy-mak= ers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of techno-economic a= ppraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts. The=  committee says it is "troubled with the failure of governance that seems t= o have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on ma= tters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broad, across dif= ferent governments at different points of time, at both the state and the c= entral level, and across different agencies associated with examining the p= roject and at both the administrative and political levels. It strains beli= ef to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigne= d responsibilities is purely co-incidental".  Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate=  these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary i= n the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry int= o the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial in= quiry would delay the negotiation process and "not serve any purpose". Ther= e may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating=  tariffs or facilitating Enron's exit, but the report certainly provides th= e Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that it needs to = start an investigation.  CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the d= eal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the pol= itical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the CVC=  can establish whether there are lapses on the part of "government function= aries including political executives" and ensure "appropriate action" again= st them. If it is indeed able to establish "undue influence" in signing the=  contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently again= st the public interest without any monetary liability.  The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who = have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that = Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated,=  regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MS= EB) financial distress. Also that DPC's extortionate tariffs are not merely=  because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, = but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enr= on's contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw mate= rial (ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply e= stimates and several legal requirements and permissions.  In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930=  crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 25= 3 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per = cent of the capacity is used for DPC. There's also a Rs 100 crore extra bil= ling to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thes= e facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging = more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the governm= ent of India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. I= t has also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel co= nsumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the power = purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed=  it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage oppor= tunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra.=20  The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four differ= ent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: a rate=  of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan= s, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dollar as=  reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculating=  Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges=  has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough negoti= ation and public pressure on the political establishment.=20  The Godbole committee has established that DPC's tariffs can easily be halv= ed if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the doll= arisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (which is=  in fact hampering MSEB's reform particularly in power distribution) are sc= rapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tariff=  would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system= . The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if = the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it sh= ould free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Mah= arashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all pro= jects negotiated by government: "The public has a right to know what is bei= ng contracted on their behalf" and has recommended that all documents, incl= uding contracts related to all Independent Power Projects (IPPs), particula= rly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within two month= s.  Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state governme= nt were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations wi= th power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption = of power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations sh= ould be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. Thi= s should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance (Patalganga), Mittals (Bh= adravati), the BSES (Saphale) and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= -------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL = EXPRESS, April 23, 2001   =20 DPC board set to authorise president, Enron MD to issue notice of terminati= on, Sanjay Jog  =20 Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement  The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has already tak= en an aggressive posture, has proposed to authorise the Enron India managin= g director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil = McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement (= PPA) and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the st= ate and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).  The board of directors, which would meet on April 25 in London, also plans = to appoint Mr Cline as its "true and lawful Attorney-in-fact" and authorise=  him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts a= nd financing agreements and their amendments and modifications.Top sources = told The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline and/or Mr McGr= egor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to t= he state and Central governments and MSEB under clause 17 and schedule 11 o= f the PPA.  "In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obligatio= ns under the PPA, the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour ob= ligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of th= e Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee, th= e company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conci= liation and arbitration proceedings," the company resolution said. "Consist= ent with this recourse to contractual remedies, the company now seeks the a= uthority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices purs= uant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the PPA from time to time and at any t= ime upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such = notices as determined by the company," the resolution added.  According to the resolution, the directors, the company secretary and offic= ers of the company and each of them acting individually, are authorised and=  empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take s= uch other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution,=  in the name and for and on behalf of the company. Against this backdrop, t= he state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issui= ng termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual ob= ligations under the PPA. The state government and MSEB sources said that su= ch a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate (pen= alty) of Rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of=  power on January 28 and February 13.  The state government and MSEB, which reviewed its position on Saturday at a=  meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, are of the view = that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio= n notice to the DPC. The DPC's move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its "true=  and lawful Attorney-in-fact" deserves importance especially when the state=  government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit = cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit=  states.  Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out = or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the=  ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs 64 crore or the equivalent in fore= ign currency in any financial year. Furthermore, Mr Cline would be in a pos= ition to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relati= ng to the day-to-day operation of the company's business or exercise its ri= ghts and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the fina= ncing agreements ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= -------------------------------------------------------------BUSINESS STAND= ARD, Monday, April 23, 2001 DPC seeks OK to exit power project , Tamal Bandyopadhyay & S Ravindran=20  The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is seeking the approval of it= s 25 lenders to pull the plug on the $3 billion power project in Maharashtr= a tomorrow (April 23).The meeting has been convened in London at the initia= tive of the company. The meeting is crucial as the DPC board is meeting on = April 25 in London to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to = the Maharshtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). =20 DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders.=  While bankers said the lenders' meeting is about the second phase of the p= roject, which is still under construction, state government officials clari= fied that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project, = the lenders' decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also. The = second phase of the project involves 1,444 MW generation capacity, whereas = Phase I of 740 MW is already operational."According to the loan agreement, = even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract t= hen DPC can do so," highly placed sources in the lenders' consortium said f= rom London.=20  This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a p= reliminary termination notice.Following the notice, there is a cooling off = period of six months for both parties (the MSEB and DPC) to find a mutually=  acceptable solution, which may take the form of a re-negotiated PPA, sourc= es added. Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled = with lenders. The Monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders includ= ing multilateral funding agencies like Japanese Exim Bank and OPIC. The sec= ond round of meetings schedule for Tuesday will be only with the global loa= n arrangers ANZ Investment Bank, CSFB, ABN -AMRO, Citibank and the State Ba= nk of India (SBI).Two representatives each from the Indian lenders, IDBI, I= CICI and SBI have already left for London.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------------------------------------------------------- AFTERNOON, April 23, 2001 Enron winding up operations in India?=20  Marred by controversies since inception, the US-based energy major Enron-pr= omoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) board will meet this Wednesday, April 25,=  in London to decide the fate of its 2,184 MW project in Dabhol, including = winding up of its operations. "The top most item on the agenda is to empowe= r DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up operations in the country,= " state government sources told PTI on Saturday. When contacted, DPC spokes= person declined to comment on the agenda of the London meeting and added, "= I will not like to comment on speculations."=20  Sources said a team comprising three top officials of Maharashtra State Ele= ctricity Board (MSEB) including chairman Vinay Bansal would attend the high= -profile board meet. Bansal told PTI that MSEB has decided to give a "fitti= ng reply" and present its case concerning the Rs. 401 crore penalty that th= e loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating requi= red power within the stipulated time as per the Power Purchase Agreement (P= PA).=20  This London meet comes two days after the international and domestic financ= ial institutions sit together (April 23) to discuss DPC's future course of = action in the wake of non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs. 223 crore by M= SEB and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty.Over the payment of=  dues of December 2000 and January of Rs. 102 crore and Rs. 111 crore respe= ctively, sources said, both the state government and MSEB had offered to ma= ke a "protest" payment as per the PPA, but DPC, India's first fasttrack pow= er project, refused to accept on that condition.=20  Currently, Enron India holds 65 per cent in the US $900 million DPC project= , which includes MSEB's 15 per cent while General Electric and Bechtel hold=  10 per cent each. The controversial "now on now off" project began in 1992=  but ran into rough weather after the Shiv Sena-BJP came to power and was s= crapped only to be revived after renegotiating the PPA. Fresh trouble arose=  in October last when MSEB began defaulting over the "enormous" billing fol= lowing which DPC invoked the state and centre's counter guarantee and also = recently sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the polit= ical "forced majeure" implying inability to conform towards any financial c= ommitment. =20 DPC had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50 = per cent but according to Enron Corp's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skillin= g the company would be interested in talking to potential buyers for its st= ake. Skilling, according to an international financial daily, said the mult= inational continues to see strong growth in North America, Europe and Austr= alia indicating a possibility of exiting from India ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------------------------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Monday, April 23, 2001 State for consolidating all DPC arbitration notices, Sanjay Jog  =20  The Maharashtra government has decided to appeal to the Centre for consolid= ating all arbitration notices served DPC for the "continuous default of con= tractual obligations" and name a common arbitrator for the state government= , the Centre and MSEB.The Maharashtra government team led by the chief mini= ster Vilasrao Deshmukh, at its meeting with the union finance minister Yash= want Sinha and union power minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday, also proposes = for the appointment of a non-Indian arbitrator with a view to cutting the c= ost substantially.  During arbitration proceedings initiated by the DPC after the repudiation o= f Dabhol phase-I by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995, a non-In= dian arbitrator, Mr Kumara Swami was appointed as an arbitrator after a sug= gestion by a senior counsel Fali Nariman. State government sources told The=  Financial Express that it would write a letter to the DPC regarding arbitr= ation proceedings after Monday's meetings. The state advocate general Goola= m Wahanwati will be suggesting a suitable arbitrator for the state and cent= ral government and MSEB.=20  The advocate general will also suggest solicitors and Queens Counsel, who m= ay be engaged in London for this purpose. Incidentally, Mr Prabhu, who was = present at the "janata darbar" organised by the Thane branch of Shiv Sena, = told reporters that the Centre would provide necessary assistance to the Ma= harashtra government to find a solution to the Dabhol imbroglio.Furthermore= , the state government would formally appeal to the Centre to nominate its = representative on the proposed committee to negotiate with the DPC in a ser= ious bid to reduce the per unit cost and assess the possibility of sale of = Dabhol power to deficit states. The government has suggested the names of H= ousing Finance Development Corporation chairman Deepak Parekh and former un= ion energy secretary EAS Sarma, who were members of the Godbole energy revi= ew committee.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------------------------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, April 23, 2001=20 Maharashtra to set up experts panel on Enron=20 =20  IN order to resolve the imbroglio over payment crisis between the Maharash= tra State Electricity Board and US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power=  Company, Maharashtra will set up an expert committee for negotiations even=  as the multinational is contemplating winding up of its operations in the = country. "We are now going for negotiations and will form an experts commit= tee in which Maharashtra expects the Centre to participate," chief minister=  Vilasrao Deshmukh told reporters after attending a condolence meeting to p= ay tributes to late Nasscom president Dewang Mehta here on Sunday. "All the=  four parties -- namely the state, Union government, Enron and MSEB -- shou= ld come together for negotiations; otherwise it cannot be a complete exerci= se," he added.=20  Deshmukh and the MSEB team are scheduled to meet Union finance minister Yas= hwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday in New Delhi to disc= uss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same. "I am meetin= g Sinha and Prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send represent= atives for the negotiations committee," he said. Deshmukh's meeting with th= e Centre comes at a crucial stage as DPC's lenders would be meeting in Lond= on, on the same day, to decide upon the future finances of the controversy = marred 2,184-mw project in Dabhol.=20  Moreover, the DPC board is also scheduled to meet on April 25 in London to = decide the fate of its $900 million project in Dabhol, including winding up=  of its operations. The meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agend= a, which was to empower DPC managing director Neil McGregor to wind up oper= ations in the country. DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on t= he Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non-pa= yment of dues amounting to Rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due=  for the months of December 2000 and January 2001.=20  Asked whether the Centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing togethe= r of the arbitration and conciliation processes, Deshmukh replied in the ne= gative. Deshmukh said MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal along with two senior offi= cials would attend DPC's board meeting in London. Bansal had said on Sunday=  that MSEB would present its case concerning the Rs 401-crore penalty that = the loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating req= uired power within the stipulated time as per the PPA. Currently, Enron Ind= ia holds 65 per cent in the $900-million DPC project, which includes MSEB's=  15 per cent, while General Electric and Bechtel hold 10 per cent each.

Sarma, hdfc chairman Deepak=  Parekh, teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official=  Vinay Mohan Lal-has recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron pow= er project deal saying it signified "the utter failure of governance that s= eems to have characterised almost every step of the decision-making process=  relating to the Dabhol project". The report, which was submitted to the Ma= harashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook, is se= verely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar (with the Congress th= en), the 13-day bjp-led Union government which reworked the deal in 1996, S= hiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra head= ed by Manohar Joshi  "The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every s= tep of decision-making relating to the Dabhol project." Madhav Godbole Comm= ittee Report  An investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three governme= nts The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron=  to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to the co= mmittee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and sta= te, and across different agencies. "It strains belief to accept that such w= idespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coin= cidental," the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implemented i= f something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also felt=  that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to o= rder a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress le= ader: "Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra a= nd put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector."  The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: "If the Enr= on decision has at all been detrimental, it is because of the haste with wh= ich phase 2 was cleared by the Shiv Sena-bjp government. Now with the state=  having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing i= s to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it'= s not an issue of corruption but that of perception."=20  Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the=  Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was=  cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Re= ddy: "Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over Tehel= ka." Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting coul= d send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from Maharashtr= a, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted with the expr= ess purpose of politicising the Enron issue. "I think I know Vilasrao Deshm= ukh's gameplan," says an MP from the state. But some MPs like Congress' Pri= thviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy that's surrounded the deal: "I= 've maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examin= e this".  The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to=  a techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electric= ity supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have=  been avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort to= wards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to=  arise, the exhaustive 93-page report points out.  "I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared = the project minutes before it quit," says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan.=20   The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberal= isation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now an est= ablished power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 1992, Enr= on signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to set=  up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects.  Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed = a writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron= . The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated de= al.  "Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very sam= e manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competiti= ve bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group stu= died the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepte= d by Dabhol, is unprecedented." Says Chavan: "I would particularly like to = highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre end= orsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned."   Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,60= 7 crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of po= wer had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal= , the payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first year= -and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtra ex= chequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.  The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabh= ol plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive al= ternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a preliminar= y stage. The report notes: "...if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pu= rsue these projects, they might not have remained in their preliminary stag= es". It adds that the members were of the opinion that "the mseb and the Ma= harashtra government erred seriously, based on information available at tha= t time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor even when its capa= city was reduced." The failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity = of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It quotes the ce= a as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonab= le, no further examination was required  Strangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with t= he BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the = deal.=20  After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi, ap= pointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises, actu= ally managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained inexplicabl= e. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also said that "si= nce no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't necessary= ." Says the committee: "This only adds strength to the suspicion that the c= ea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all. Indeed, give= n the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on June 24, 19= 94, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December 23, 199= 4, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discu= ssed at all.''  The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously question= ed. "The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no mention of = any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million to $2,501 = million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committ= ee," the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: "It is strange that t= he Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly=  renegotiated the deal." The committee further spells out the losses incurr= ed through the deal. "Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the finan= cial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profit in = 1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."=20  Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent w= eaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, a=  top bank official had said that "after a detailed review of the analytical=  framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion tha= t the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justifie= d" and that in "our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb s= ystem in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic = plant dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be=  replaced by the higher cost lng power."  Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged = from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian offici= al, Ajit Nimbalkar: "I recently met with the World Bank and have been follo= wing the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank opinion c= an be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the media from h= ere on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington= ."  The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Mahara= shtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the first = time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of suc= h a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the better p= erforming boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and = distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue sur= pluses on an accrual basis.  Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's in= dustrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electri= fication. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. "This impr= ovement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation underta= ken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was b= eing considered," the report points out. Following a policy of cross-subsid= y, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.  But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn= 't been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 199= 5-96 to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly fiv= e-fold to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise = per unit-from 15 to 41 paise-an increase of 173 per cent. "The increase in = the subsidy claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap princ= ipally because of the increase in power purchase costs," says the committee= , adding: "Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb c= ould be financially healthy."  But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come=  up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related = documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do= wn the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power = outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, a= nd thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality on= ly with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The ques= tion is, can that be achieved in an unstable political environment?

This was largely due to the disconn= ection drive on defaulter connections -- pegged at nearly 20,000 disconnect= ions a month -- which resulted in compliance by consumers.

For instance, = MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31, = 2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making=  it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power station= s recorded the highest availability percentage at 86.1 up from 84.6 per cen= t last fiscal. Plant load factor is up to 72.78 per cent, compared with 71.= 7 per cent in 2000.=20  The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten=  years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligib= le for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines = issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs 12.5 lakh. Al= l other power stations in the state, without exception, also fulfill the el= igibility criteria for the cash award, a senior MSEB official said. Similar= ly, the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of any stat= e electricity board to get the ISO 9002 certification.=20  A senior MSEB official said: "Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much inte= rference in its day to day functioning.

beck-s	 fyi - see Joel's status report below and my comments.  What I would like to  do is start hosting a monthly meeting to give a status update on our  projects.  What do you think ?  ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 10/10/2000  09:32 AM ---------------------------   Mary Solmonson 10/10/2000 09:33 AM To: Joel Henenberg/NA/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Re: September Status Report    Good.  It is nice to get a recap of what's going on.  A few comments....  1) Can I see the OPM vision document?  2) MKM Phase I - what's included?  what's the business benefit?  3) MKM - Decommisioning of Phoenix.  I think you might be getting a little  ahead of yourself here.  First you will need to integrate MKM with EnPower,  Unify, and Sitara.  What are the plans for that?  I also think the delay in  the Calculation component could be a problem.  For instance, we currently use  spreadsheets to calculate the average prices and then key them into Unify  (maybe Phoenix).  We do this because we don't have the ability to key  anything into either Phoenix or MKM.  How will we do this if Phoenix goes  away?  I want to make sure the process is thoroughly thought through here.  4) MKM - Support of both Phoenix and LIM is a duplication of efforts and  costly.....   The plans here need to go back to the vision.  Where is the  step by step plan of getting to the vision?  5) GRS Support - The most important interim priority is not reflected here  which concerns me.  Because Reuters accuracy is so poor, the most critical  thing we need is the ability to select an alternate source for pricing, such  as CQG, for the downloads!  6) GRS Support - OPIS validation.  This is a business issue and I'm not sure  this should be reflected in your status report, but you do need to make sure  Steve gets on this.   Clearly from this, I think good coordination and project management is still  lacking in the Rates/MKM world.  Is Stuart calling the shots (Phoenix  decommisioning) or are we?

beck-s	 Hey Tom and Sally,  I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen  yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal  loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future  enhancements.   Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the  process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help  make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for  early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process  rolling.    The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not  like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the  look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as  possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the  last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue.   Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually  said we did an excellent job.    Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical  Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market  where we could make money, where Enron has enough volume that we could really  relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids,  Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justify  the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as  additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP  data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics,  exporting data, and finally automatching.  Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with  the site and our progress to date.  Brad 
beck-s	 Hi Vince,   Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for  each region from David Hoog's Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they  explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's  outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve  to mark the non-firm position.  My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to  sell his product internally to the desk.    Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define "non-firm"?   The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's  outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of  non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a  unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.   Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the "non-firm curve for the  region"?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units.  Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.  Thanks,   Vasant

Thank you.  Produced  Friday, December 29, 2000.  Our panelists are Elizabeth Dater, Louis  Holland, Barbara Marcin and Brian  Rogers.  LOUIS  RUKEYSER: Good evening. I'm Louis Rukeyser. This is Wall Street Week.   Welcome back.   Well, folks,  now you know why they call it black tie.   Much of the  world of investors regards 2000 as a year of mourning -- for  profits past, for  bubbles burst, for bulls de-horned and for certainties  crumbled.  And let's face  it: It wasn't always fun.   As Winston  Churchill put it, "I'm always ready to learn, although I do not  always like to  be taught."   Virtually  nobody except the non-stop pessimists -- who are still stone  losers over the  past decade -- foresaw the viciousness of this year's  declines -- although the  year was contradictory, even there.  For example, is  this a bear market?   Well, yes and  no.  Even from their  highest heights in early 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial  Average and the  S&P 500 have declined far less than the twenty percent that  traditionally  has defined a bear market.  But for the  formerly high-flying technology stocks personified by the  Nasdaq, this has not  only been a bear -- but the growly of all time.  Nasdaq, which  never does things moderately, fell nearly 40 percent this year  -- and is off  more than 51 percent from its March 10th high.   That makes this  not only the worst year ever for the 29-year-old Nasdaq, but  the biggest  decline for any of the three major indexes since the S&P 500  lost 47  percent in 1931, during the Great Depression.   So devastating  was this latest, and most severe, tech wreck that any attempt  to put it in  perspective -- by pointing out, say, that Nasdaq has been the  bullish  phenomenon of the past decade -- and that it gained more than 85  percent in  1999 alone -- is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history  to today's  bleeding tech investors.  Are they right?  Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically  promising up-trend, or is  it truly the end of a booming era?   Were the  downward catalysts of 2000 -- a fierce Federal Reserve, a steeply  weakening  economy and a nation driven to embarrassing self-doubt by the  Election That  Would Not Die -- passing phenomena or auguries of enduring  change?  We'll try to  get you some meaningful answers tonight -- in the company of  four  sharp-shooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our  viewers  significant money in 2000 while the markets -- and most of their  competitors  -- faltered.   We'll review  what really did happen in 2000 -- to the economy and to  investors -- and we'll  see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in  the year ahead -- in  which, not to put too fine a point on it, Wall Street  owes us all a lot!    But, first,  let's see how the best-performing got better -- and the  worst-hit got  hysterical -- in a characteristically mixed ending to a  thoroughly mixed-up  year.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average ended on a stronger note, despite a  final-day sell-off,  gaining more than 150 points to close the year at  10,787.99 -- making this the  Dow's first losing year since 1990.  Most indexes  followed the Dow's upward lead -- with the conspicuous  exception of, you  guessed it, Nasdaq, which ended the year at less than half  its March  peak.  But the elves,  filled with the holiday spirit -- or something -- continue to  insist that  better times lie ahead both for the Dow -- where our haloes go,  as usual, to  those who voted neutral three months ago, since when the Dow is  up by just a  bit more than one percent -- and for Nasdaq, which we now  insist they also  predict -- to see if that can improve their worst overall  yearly record since  they were created.  There were  minimal changes in the bond and oil markets, and the dollar had a  mixed week  -- as the long-suffering euro continued its recent rebound.  And if your  investments this year are giving you palpitations, try munching  some of those  holiday sweets you've been trying to put out of your mind.   A new report in  the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that  chocolate may  protect against heart disease.  The theory is  that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent build-up of  blood  platelets.  Brian Rogers,  what's it going to take to build up investor psychology in  Wall  Street?  ROGERS:  Well, Lou, I think what we've seen is a very natural transition this  year away  from some of the higher-flying sectors of 1999. And I think  investors as we  enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression,  what the Fed does  with rates, and I think an awful lot will be determined,  at least in the first  part of the year, on what happens to mutual fund cash  flows.   RUKEYSER:  When will we know that? A week or two from now, or will it take  longer?    ROGERS:  I think we'll see a lot of indications in January. I think the Fed  will meet  several weeks into the new year. I think we'll see trends in  mutual fund cash  flow data evident by the end of January. And then we also  have the January  effect I suppose we can look forward to, to see how the  first month of the  year shakes out.  RUKEYSER: So basically, if things don't look a heck of a lot  better by  mid-January, that's going to be a bad sign.  ROGERS:  You can take the rest of the year off at that point.   RUKEYSER: Thanks for your encouragement. Barbara Marcin, what do  you think?  What's it going to take to pep up the investors?   MARCIN:  Well, I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of  profit and  growth priced into the market here. And I really think that what  happened this  year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really  led the market  down. It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks  which boomed so  much last year. And last year you could have a reasonable  return which would  look very mediocre if you weren't invested in those  stocks, and this year if  you have a reasonable return, it looks very good,  because the telecom and  technology stocks declined so much. So I think it's  really just been a matter  of resetting expectations, and I think we can  still have a good market here  with a broad number of stocks attractively  priced.  RUKEYSER: So it was a good thing that those jazzed-up fly boys  came down to  earth, huh?   MARCIN:  Well, I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market  certainly,  yes.  RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, Brian mentioned the Fed. How important is  the Fed in  all this?  HOLLAND:  Well, I think the Fed made a big mistake. I mean they raised  interest rates,  you know, 6 times in 15 months. You know, basically the  economy, inflation was  not an issue at the time that they were raising it.  And now of course they  took money out of the system because they put a lot  in at the end of '99 for  Y2K issues, and now they've taken it out. So really  I think they've dropped  the ball here, and I think that they're going to  have to cut rates here over  the next month or so.   RUKEYSER:  How much impact will that have? Wall Street expects them to do  that  doesn't it?   HOLLAND:  Well, I think it does, Wall Street expects that. But I think,  again, to  see it is to believe it, and I think to the extent that Greenspan  has sort of  been a follower, he has not been a leader. So I suspect that any  positive  action here will be received relatively positively.  RUKEYSER: You mean the markets have led him.   HOLLAND:  That's exactly right.   RUKEYSER: And they're now leading him to a rate cut.   HOLLAND:  Exactly.   RUKEYSER: I  see. Well, I hope Mr. Greenspan understands that. Beth Dater,  what do you  think?  DATER:  Well, that's an interesting point, because I think typically the  stock market  is driven by the economy. What's sort of interesting about the  last  year-and-a-half is that to some extent the economy has been driven by  the  stock market and the wealth effect. And so I think what's going to be  really  important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can  adjust to  a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more  like eight  percent than 25 or 30 or high double-digit gains.   RUKEYSER: The consumer didn't seem to be too sanguine this  Christmas.   DATER:  No, the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here.  And I think  the question will be, back to Brian's point, what will happen  when the  consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual  fund  business. It's something to watch very closely I think.  RUKEYSER: There was a fall off in the rate of net input into  mutual funds  last month, which is not surprising. What do you think? Why  should people  turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds  now?  DATER:  Well, I think there's, I think that consumers also have to adjust to  the  fact that, you know, the same 25 stocks aren't going to carry  everything, that  there are areas of diversification, such as fixed income  and value and other  styles of investing, where one can still receive good  returns over time.    RUKEYSER: All right. Now, before we look ahead with our winners  of the year,  let's review where we've been in a year most investors would love  to forget.   The Dow Jones  Industrial Average was the year's first victim, falling nearly  2,000 points  after peaking in mid-January at a record 11,723 -- but then  gained most of it  back, ending with a loss of just over six percent.  The S&P 500  peaked later -- in March -- but recovered less, losing a bit  more than ten  percent for the year.  But the true  carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq, which was butchered by  more than 39  percent.  In contrast,  both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes  -- which track  all the common stocks traded there -- eked out small gains  for the year --  while the small-stock Russell 2000 was down by just 4.2  percent.  Even a bad year  for stocks and a hint of inflation couldn't revive the  fortunes of the  investment world's longest sufferers -- the gold bugs --  whose favorite metal  continued to tarnish. And silver did even worse.  The strong man  of the year was the U.S. dollar, which easily outperformed  all other major  currencies, with a particularly dazzling gain of 12 percent  against the  yen.  Meanwhile, the  U.S. economy continued -- as it has now for nearly ten years  -- what has  become a record expansion -- but new doubts about its durability  arose as  growth slowed in the third quarter to just 2.2 percent and the  fourth quarter  seemed even weaker.  There was a  slight whiff of inflation midway through the year, helped along  by a stunning  rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by  Fed officials, who  last year took the Y2K threat too seriously. By November,  there was some  relief -- consumer prices for the past 12 months had  increased 3.4 percent,  ahead of the pace a year ago, but off the summer  highs.  Continuing to  defy old-fashioned economic textbooks, unemployment remained  low, even as  inflation blipped -- and the economy chugged forward. U.S.  unemployment  reached a three-decade low at 3.9 percent, and as of the last  monthly report,  in November, was still holding at just four percent.  Even the  ever-edgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation -- and with  the  prospect of a softer economy, the ghouls rejoiced. The yield on the  30-year  Treasury bond was driven down to 5.46 percent -- more than a full  point lower  than where it was a year ago.  But short-term  rates -- which are more-easily controlled by the Federal  Reserve -- climbed  nearly as much as long rates fell. The average yield on  taxable money-market  funds is now up to six percent.  The year's big  international economic story was oil. From below $11.00 a  barrel just two  years ago, oil climbed over $37.00 this past September  before retreating to  today's $26.80 -- a little more than a dollar higher  than a year  ago.  For the fourth  year in a row, the U.S. trade deficit is setting a record in  2000 -- and next  April will mark a full quarter-century since the U.S. last  saw even a monthly  trade surplus.  And where do we  go from here? The Conference Board's index of so-called  leading economic  indicators has been anemic throughout 2000 with outright  negative readings in  four of the past five months.  Brian Rogers,  which of these numbers, if any, is the one to watch in the  2001  markets?  ROGERS:  Lou, I think the most important thing will be what happens to  corporate  earnings in the first half. Things have been sluggish in the  second half of  this year, and I think as we enter the new year corporate  profitability will  be the most important thing affecting how investors view  markets.   RUKEYSER: And what's your guess on how that will turn out?    ROGERS:  I think we'll have a decent profit year, but when I say decent, Lou,  my best  guess is in the five to seven percent range, and not much more than  that, from  a corporate profitability standpoint.   RUKEYSER: Do you think the markets are expecting that?    ROGERS:  I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that, which  makes me  think we might continue to have some, again some choppiness in the  first part  of 2001.   RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, what are you going to keep your eye on?   MARCIN:  I'm going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels. You  know, we  had three forces which slowed the economy this year: the Federal  Reserve  raising interest rates, high oil and gas prices, and really a sharp  drop off  in consumer confidence as the stock market fell, and that slowed  spending a  lot. And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers  really  stopped spending, that could spiral a little bit more into companies   incorporating that and having layoffs, and really then we could get a   recession. So that's what I'm keeping my eye on.  RUKEYSER: Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this  whole  expansion.   MARCIN:  Yes.  RUKEYSER:  There are some signs they're flagging a little, but you want to  see how  much.   MARCIN:  Yes.   RUKEYSER: What's your guess?   MARCIN:  I think that, right now I'm not predicting a recession, so I'm not  predicting  that they're going to flag that much more. We just had, this week  the third  straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence. And I think  that perhaps,  come the new year, we can regain it, but that is what I'm  concerned about.    RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, how about you?   HOLLAND:  I agree with Barbara. I think the consumer sentiment has  deteriorated, and I  think that there's probably a greater than 50-50 chance  that we're probably  going to have a recession. It's sort of the old notion  of the Federal Reserve  pushing on the string in order to get the economy  going by reducing rates or  injecting money into the system. And I'm not so  sure that the system will  swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling  into recession.  RUKEYSER: So you think the Fed has waited far too long.    HOLLAND:  I think so.   RUKEYSER:  Do you think there's a chance that they'll cut more than a quarter  percent  next month?   HOLLAND:  I think it's possible that they could have an interim meeting to  cut, and I  think it's very possible they could cut a half a point.   RUKEYSER:  Beth, can you cheer me up any more?   DATER:  Well, I think it gets down to interest rates, because I think that is  what  will ultimately influence the consumer confidence. I'm a little bit  concerned  about the dollar in here. I mean I think that we have had a huge  amount of  foreign investment also into our capital markets here, and if the  dollar were  to weaken substantially, that might be at risk, and we might see  some  repatriation of some of those foreign investments.   RUKEYSER: All right. Now comes the moment of truth when we turn  the  spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago.  In what has  been for decades the toughest competition in investing -- the  lists cannot be  changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months --  it was a tough year  even for our certified geniuses -- though the average of  all our panelists  continued to beat the performance of the S&P 500, let  alone the sagging  Nasdaq.   You can check  all their records on our web site. It will be up after  midnight tonight. As  you'll see, the five who actually defied the odds, and  made you money in 2000,  included the four stalwarts here tonight.  Brian Rogers,  to show what a weird year it was, you were the second-closest  of all our  panelists, behind Marty Zweig, in predicting the Dow's 2000 high  and close --  though even you were too optimistic by nearly 800 and 1,000  points,  respectively. That was good this year.  But in the  far-more-important, actual money-making part of the competition,  you excelled  -- with a portfolio of specific recommendations that, according  to  calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets, was up a  whopping  42.5 percent, aided by three timely short sales and a near-double  in Bergen  Brunswig. Congratulations!  ROGERS:  Thank you.   RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, with both you and Brian here, it's clearly the  value  players' night out. While your prediction that the Dow would get above  14,000  turned out to be ridiculously high, you came within 11 points -- 11  points --  of nailing the precise Dow low of 9796.03. And better still, your  portfolio is  up more than 40 percent in this generally-grim year -- thanks  to the best  single pick of any panelist, Everest Reinsurance Holdings --  which rewarded  you with a 222-percent gain. So thanks, Barbara, for bringing  us so much  value!   MARCIN:  Thank you.   RUKEYSER:  Lou Holland, welcome back to your fourth year-end appearance, the  most of  any panelist here tonight, and you earned it. While your high, low  and close  were way off the mark -- a familiar song this year -- your  portfolio was up  more than 28 percent, powered by the more-than-doubling of  Washington Mutual.  Way to go, Lou.   HOLLAND:  Thank you.   RUKEYSER: Beth Dater, this is your third year-end program. And  your cautious  approach to investing in 2000 -- including putting 20 percent of  the  portfolio in three-year Treasury notes -- paid off with an average gain of   more than 7.5 percent. In 2000, that looked awful good. So congratulations,   Beth.  DATER:  Thank you, Lou.   RUKEYSER:  But enough with the compliments -- however well-earned in a year  like this  past one. There's a new, and we hope different, year ahead -- and  what have  you done for us lately? For starters, in our annual triumph of  hope over  experience, let's hear from each of you the true inside word on  the highest  close, the lowest close, and the final close for both the Dow  Jones Industrial  Average and Nasdaq in 2001. And this time, gang, let's all  get it exactly  right.   Brian?  ROGERS:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,500, a low of 10,000, and a  close of  11,900. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 3,000, a low of 2,000, and a  close of  2,250.   RUKEYSER: Barbara?   MARCIN:  For the Dow, I have a high of 13,000, a low of 10,500, and a close  of 12,000.  And for Nasdaq, a high of 3,200, a low of 2,500, and a close of   3,000.  RUKEYSER: Lou?   HOLLAND:  For the Dow, I have a high of 12,936, a low of 10,100, and a close  of  12,504. For the Nasdaq, I have a high of 3,090, a low of 2,101, and a  close of  2,842.  RUKEYSER: Beth?  DATER:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,175, a low of 9,781, and a  close of  11,740. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 2,834, a low of 2,404, and a  close of  2,734.   RUKEYSER:  Okay. Well, one thing is for sure -- and this is my only  personal,  unqualified guarantee of the night: At least some of them will be   wrong.  But, if you'd  like to see the full predictions, with specific stock  selections, from all 22  of our panelists, all those lists will be included  in tonight's transcript --  which you can get for $7.50 by writing to  Year-End Transcripts, Wall $treet  Week With Louis Rukeyser, Owings Mills,  Maryland 21117 -- or, you can order  on-line, for $10.00, by visiting our web  site at: pbs.org.  And now, let's  see what these fabulous four think are the very best buys for  2001.  Brian?  ROGERS:  Lou, Aon Corp, Cypress Semiconductor, Disney, Exodus Communications,  Fortune  Brands, Hasbro, Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Fund, Motorola,  Octel, Ryder  (System), Sprint (FON Group), and Unisource Energy.  RUKEYSER: Barbara?   MARCIN:  I'm keeping the two from this year's list that did not perform, and  that's  Cendant and Mattel, and I'm adding Compaq, WorldCom, Lucent, Loral  (Space  & Communications), AT&T Wireless, and Motorola.   RUKEYSER: A little tech in there, hmm?   MARCIN:  Yes.   RUKEYSER:  Tech's going to have a little comeback you think?   MARCIN:  That's right. Tech and telecom maybe.  RUKEYSER: Some of those bleeding people will be very happy to  hear that from  a cautious person like yourself. Lou?   HOLLAND:  Okay, I have Carnival Corp., CEC Entertainment, Ceridian Corp.,  Clorox  Company, Chase Manhattan Bank, Cognos Inc., Intel -- one of your  favorites,  Louis -- Home Depot, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, and WorldCom.   RUKEYSER: My favorites are the ones that go up. The ones I hate  are the ones  that go down. You know what Will Rogers said, there's nothing  hard about the  stock market. You buy a stock, and when it goes up, you sell  it. If they  don't go up, you don't buy. Beth Dater, your list?   DATER:  Lou, 25% weighting in 3-year U.S. Treasury notes. The balance equally  weighted  in Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, Cisco Systems, Intel, MedImmune,  Mellon Bank,  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Royal Dutch Petroleum,  Schlumberger, Wal-Mart, and  Westwood One.  RUKEYSER:  Hearing as much financial services as I do, is that an interest  rate  forecast as well?  DATER:  It's an interest rate forecast, and also it's a call on valuations,  which I  think are still very interesting in that area.   RUKEYSER: How about some of those fallen giants that you've  picked? That  suggests to me that you don't think it's the end of the world.    DATER: I  do not think it's the end of the world. And I do think it's a time  of some  uncertainty and it's a time to think of preservation of capital  first and  foremost, and therefore, I'm going with some household names at  this point.    RUKEYSER: Especially some that have been knocked so far down  that...   DATER:  Exactly. The valuations are coming into reasonable levels.  RUKEYSER: Brian Rogers, let's hear from you on interest rates.  What do you  think?   ROGERS:  Lou, I think we'll see a normalization of the yield curve this year,  so I  think we'll see short rates fall. The Fed will cut rates probably a  couple of  times. And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in  calendar  year 2000. I think that game is probably mostly over would be my  best guess.    RUKEYSER:  And short-term rates you don't think are going to fall that much?    ROGERS:  No, I think short-term rates will fall causing the yield curve to   look...  RUKEYSER:  But how much do you think they'll fall?   ROGERS:  I think they'll fall at least 50 or 75 basis points this year.   RUKEYSER: Okay. If we can get that over the next two weeks, that  might help  some of your inflows into your mutual funds.  ROGERS:  Well, we'll be happy then.   RUKEYSER:  Thank you all very much. There we do have to stop. I hope you'll  join me  next week twice -- first, for our regular program when my guest will  be the  incomparable Abby Joseph Cohen -- and then for a very special,  hour-long  "Louis Rukeyser's 2001 Money Guide" -- when my guests will include  four  world-class industrial titans -- true shapers of our future in the year  -- and  the century -- ahead.  Meanwhile, this  has been "Wall Street Week." I'm Louis Rukeyser, wishing you  a happy -- and  infinitely more prosperous -- New Year.

beck-s	 Hi Vince and Happy New Year Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to balance my commitments here.  Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.  As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.  I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this time he will not miss it.

beck-s	 Hi Vince,  Thank you for sending me the email from Don Reid regarding the Turkey FX and  CPI curve.  I received the same email last week and the request has been  taken care of.  In fact, he had a very short time line for the request  and  had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid.  If the deal goes  through RAC, I'm sure we'll get another request for the curve, but for now,  Don said that he doesn't need a forecast from us.    Regards,  Farouk Z. Lalji

I understand that you have spoken to my father, Scott Wells at Texaco, and he has informed me that Enron accepts interns only when a department asks for one.  I'd like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer.  I interned for Dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms for working in the gas industry.  I worked on the trading floor as a gas scheduler, and after only a month I was controlling the northeast CNG pipeline.  This helped because I really got to learn were many of the northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points.  Other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of the gas bought and sold that morning.  Throughout the day I would work on projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the trading floor.  It was all a great learning experience for me and I hope to use my knowledge again this summer for Enron.  I would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper Human Resource personnel so that I might be able to contact him or her in hopes of a future internship possibility.  I will be available to have a start date of May 15th and be available for employment until school resumes in late August.  Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from someone in your company at his/her earliest convenience.  Please feel free to call me at 940-323-0891, or email me at Rollins50@aol.com.

The idea of the latter is just to introduce yourself to the other panelists and give them some background on how you are approaching the issues we will discuss.  We will also provide copies to the attendees and use this material for our personal introductions at the opening of the panel discussions.  Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.

beck-s	 Brent and Sally,  After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it  would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.   Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for  doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together  towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in  to completing this database in a timely fashion.  Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business  would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1  2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we  begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture,  valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian  Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.  I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,  Todd   ------------------- Forwarded by D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT on 09/13/2000 03:22 PM  ---------------------------   Richard Burchfield 09/12/2000 06:20 PM To: D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian  Hudson/LON/ECT@ECT, Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Weather  Todd,  Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather  Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements  with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the  project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the  "Thunderball" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have  co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for  Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet  trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls  for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be  discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition  of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel  development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in  mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person  will manage the effort across teams.   Richard 
beck-s	 Hi Vince,  Last evening I received the Employment Authorization Card from INS, valid for  one year.  It seems Milenia Soto has submitted all the applications but for  some reason she did not receive the receipts.     I really appreciate your help and support.  With regards,  Amitava

I have put together  an initial list of attributes for our Research projects.   The list in in the  attached spreadsheet.   It would be great if you can set up these attributes  for us in the test environment.   This would allow us to make any obvious  changes before moving to production.   Let me know what your schedule would  be in rolling this out.  My brief comments in the spreadsheet may not be clear, so feel free to give  me a call at x34748 to clarify anything.

Hi everyone,  I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some=20 questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid=20 writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so=20 exclusive, this will have to do for now.  Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure=20 complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode= ls=20 for each contract. However, the JC Penny=01,s version can serve as a testin= g=20 platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to= =20 the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so= =20 some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get bac= k.=20  1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to= =20 regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and= =20 re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done alrea= dy.  2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input cred= it=20 rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contrac= t=20 period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me tha= t=20 the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating=20 transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies=20 changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some=20 constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a= =20 more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.  3) Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that= =20 the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different=20 business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we a= re=20 dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not= =20 get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom= ery=20 Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good.

beck-s	 Dear Sally,  Hope all is going well.  The following is a list of things I'm working on.    I'm midway through putting together the "straw-man" for the doorstep review -  which will consist of a proposal on what our goals are, what should be done  to meet those goals, who should do it, and when it should be done.  I hope to  have it ready for your review during the week of the 12th.  I'm working  together with Rick Carson on it, and also obtaining input from all the people  who participated in previous doorstep reviews. I'm working with Mike to determine what gaps we have in the DPR process  (certain info may not be complete, some books are not received on a timely  basis).  We have some thoughts, I just need to write them up and do a bit of  research to determine how to deal with these issues. I have a meeting set up with Jan-Erland for next Friday to discuss Japan.   I've been attending the conference calls, but need to establish my role in  the process.  I also received a message from Joe Hirl, and will set up a  meeting with him while I'm in Japan. I've made initial contact with India, and will start attending their  conference calls.  Milind Laad has asked me to fly down to see the office,  but before I do that, I need to get up to speed with what they have done  already. I've met with Eugenio and we have discussed the projects he works on.  He and  I need to structure what his future projects are and the resources needed for  those projects. I'll be in London next week (I leave this Sunday and will be back in the  office on Friday) working with Brent.  I expect he will be able to give me a  lot of information to help with the doorstep straw-man.  Patti is trying to set up a weekly or bi-weekly discussion for us, starting  the week of the 12th. Until that time, I'll keep you updated through e-mail  and voice mail.  If you need me, I have given Patti all my contact info for  next week.  Have a good week-end.  Shona

beck-s	 Hi guys  I need some advice.  Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions  of Exotica.  At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your  more up-to-date version, and I'm concerned that there may be RAC-style  implications.  I'm in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal  regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.  Do we need to get our heads together to "form a view" before we involve RAC  or the business groups?  Anjam tells Sharad that London Exotica was built using Excel 95, and that  neither he nor Zimin knows how to build/compile the XLA using later versions  of Excel.  Is this true?  If so, then we need to migrate to XLLs sooner  rather than later because of the maintenance implications.  Steve

beck-s	 Stinson, I had a discussion with Jim and he said that the company's name is  Mill three. They provide modeling tools for Tiered QoS and the like for  network planning.  He said that the code is written in C and that we should  be able to work with it. He will get us the contact name and we can get a  presentation for us.  Jim said that he arranged for this before he met me and  learned of our (EBS Research) role in this matter. I made it clear to Jim  that John Griebling had asked us to set up this group to do modeling and that  we are in the process of arranging for 4 OR modeling experts to reside in  Houston. From now on Jim and I will work hand and hand on such issues along  with you to make sure that we initiate development efforts as soon as  possible to utilize Krishna, Samer and Co. asap...  I'll take care of arranging a meeting with these consultatants ASAP.  My involvement in Hamachi is through Jim Irvine. Jim and I are working very  well together due to our engineering background. Jim has been a network  (communications) engineer in the army for about 20 years.  For Hamachi, there  were gap analysis that needed to be done w.r.t. network reach and when and  where the network will be available (EBS' and Hamachi's). Additionally, we  would look at when Tom Gros wanted pooling points up and running, we would  then look at Hamachi's pooling point sites and come up with requests to  change dates or third party involvements.  For the most part, our efforts has been to interview Hamachi network  developers about their plans and put the data together in a manner that we  can summarize for John. Additionally, we've had two meetings with Sycamore  (they have offices in Denver) on their products and Brett gave a presentation  on his effort to Jim, etc.... More details later when we meet.

We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate  this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around  him any longer.  I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.  We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in  practically every location where we operate.  A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false  security for both an employee and the company.  I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc  you. I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.  Vince      Dale Surbey 07/11/2000 10:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Steve Leppard  Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.  I'd value your thoughts on this.  Thanks,  Dale

beck-s	 Vince,  I must apologize.  I have not had time to look over the proposal in any  detail.  When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was  still pre-business plan stage.  He has since sent me some ideas and  information.  I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political  issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability.   Give me the weekend to look over the information.

The criteria for these individuals  are as follows:  PRC Representatives The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD  process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will  facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that  participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for  exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently,  Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion  track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on  promotion track to Vice President.   Commercial Staffing Leads  We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that  the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office  of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with  the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the  hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly  respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should  not be delegated to an HR representative. Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to  those of you who have responded. Charlene

beck-s	 Vince,  Last Monday, I sent the VP's an e-mail asking for their help (from them, or  from one of the people working with them) in providing a Technical Corner  article by today.  To date, Sandeep and Mike have responded but cannot do one  for this coming week.  I didn't get a response from the other three.  Do you  have something that could be easily adapted for the Monday issue?  And, any suggestions about how to motivate a VP would be appreciated.  My  usual approach is to ask politely, which usually gets a positive response.  I  know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work, but surely as  much as our people like to publish their ideas, one person out of  forty-some-odd would be able to do something in a week's time, right?  As always, I appreciate your help.  And, if you would care to share some  advice on how I can do this in a better way, I will always listen and learn.  Sam

(A purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in  sitara).    Per our conversation Friday, it sounds like HPLC does owe Mobil for his  gas, right?   Sale to Mobil: 1/2000 - Per the pipe statement provided by Greg Bonin for Centana volumes,  299,893   flowed in January.  I billed 299,893 and Mobil paid it.  Logistics said 19,893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to Mobil  because  the gas wasn't scheduled.  In addition, if the 19,893 were a sale to Mobil,  the   point would not be in balance in the system.  The source of 280,000 of the  gas  says they only sold 280,000mms and not any more. No other sources are in the  system.    I assume if the 19,893 wasn't consumed by Mobil, they wouldn't have   paid for it.   Is there storage involved here?  If so, whose storage and how  did it work?   There are sales in other months with discrepancies on Centana with smaller  volumes  than in 1/2000.  Once I understand what happened in January, maybe that will  help me with the other months.  Please let me know if there is any other information you need from me  relating to  the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this.  I  can bring the pipe statements to you if that would help.  Thanks, Kris

beck-s	 Hello, Vince!  Happy Thanksgiving!  Per our talk, here is a master list of Total Return Swap deals. I am giving  it a shot to compile everything in a spreadsheet ("Trigger Event"), please be  advised whether it is helpful.  Thanks!   Li   
beck-s	 Dave,  No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.  Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).  I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He  wants to come back  after 2 months.  My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite  competent. I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other  side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. "The  Return of Grant  Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth  opportunities (and that I am good manager).  Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just  re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required  to hire a VP.  Vince      David W Delainey 12/14/2000 10:29 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: PRC  Vince, can you provide for me a detailed list of 2000 accomplishments,  strengths/weaknesses and feedback against the criteria for the 2000 PRC.    I need that in the next week or so.  Thanks Delainey  
beck-s	 Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.   Stack Manager Changes  Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website.   If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.  To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.  
beck-s	 Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the  engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron  Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires  considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to  develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.   Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary  focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning EECC:  EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of  Enron Transportation Services.   NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to Enron entities and third parties. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the  EES Office of the Chairman.    These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth  opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our  employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes. 
beck-s	  Per our conversation, here is the model that I have for Simon.  The notes  that I gave you were from some work I did back in September as I was looking  for volume numbers.  The notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers.   Briefly, the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk.   Ideally, this would be anything that effects NPV of the  deal.  However, I think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the EAM volumes.  Even here, such a problem set  is quite large.  If you glance at the spreadsheet model, you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the EAM volumes.   If we are to do this rigorously, then it is necessary to tear apart EES's  business model, and although such an attempt to do so would be noble, the  scope of such an excercise may be too large.  We need a clear definition of  EES Operational Risk.   Briefly, from the EES deals that I have looked at, two things drive their  profit:  a long term bet that power prices will go down, and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements.  Each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet, as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on.  95% of the savings is  assumed to come from power, and 5% from gas.  (The effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given).  If we have data that show the realized efficiency gains,  then it would be simple [in principle] to determine a distribution, and hence  a distribution of EAM volumes, NPV's, etc.  At this time, I understand that  RAC has determined some of the realized efficiency gains, but my knowledge is  quite sketchy.  Jay Hachen may have more info.   If I get a chance, I will try to see if I can do a "proof of concept"  excercise, but I have a late January deadline on something else.   Another point:  even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model, EES has chosen to book things differently.  I do not have a thorough  understanding of their IT systems, but at least in principle, if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model, then we can do it in their IT environment  (data are data are data).  They may book efficiency gains through improvement  type, such as gains due to compressors, chillers, boilers, etc.  If this is  indeed the case, then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement.      If we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their IT  systems, then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system.  It  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by Excel  workbooks.  It can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries, but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks.   Finally, Don Hawkins does Operational Audits for Enron's physical assets.   He sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets.  I don't  think that he does it for EES, but you might want to give him a call anyway.  -Kevin K.  PS:  The EES lunch meeting has been moved to Wednesdays.  Jay Hachen will  know more. 
beck-s	 Hey man this is Stacy. I was checking out the HighSchoolAlumni website tonight and I saw your name and thought I'd write ya. Man I can't believe it's been this long. Last time I saw you was that night at A&M when you, me and John Agee went out drinking and running over signs. I was living up in Dallas for about 4 years but I moved back to MP about a year ago. I also got married and had a little baby girl in since then too. Anyway I just wanted to say hi. Hope I'm emailing the right person here. Mail me back man.   PS.. Maybe we can get Scotty T, Jim Richey, and us together for that fabled camping trip.

beck-s	 Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:  What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy - in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.  Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.  This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could "chip in" varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford it.  Thoughts?   -Cara  Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas.usta.com 
beck-s	 Mike & Mark,  Due to IT created production issues in Enron's mission critical applications  since the first of 2001 the following guidelines will need to be adhered with  several exceptions.  Guidelines:    In the Houston application environment there will be no production  migrations +- 5 days of the end on month.     Development teams will be moving to a more standard production migration  schedule. Schedule to be rolled out in     March 2001.     IT will be removed from production access with the exception of 1 or 2  senior developers per team.       Exceptions:   Production fixes will move into production as they do today.    Application enhancements that have been formally approved by the Business  and IT.    New applications that are in their start-up phase.    Current processes that require IT intervention in order for it to be  successful. Processes will be reviewed in order to    replace in the future  with automation.  All the Houston IT leads are aware of these guidelines and exceptions.   Richard 
beck-s	 Congratulation on your promotion it is well deserved.  Thresa 
beck-s	 Rick,  I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us  their progress implementing risk management practices.  Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for  banks (you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?  Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned (given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8, at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.  I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.  Vince

beck-s	 Good morning everyone:  Vince would like to schedule a follow-up meeting on Wharton as soon as we can agree on a time.  How does Monday the 18th look for you?  Vince is free from 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM and from 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM.  Please let me know if you are available during any of these times.  Thanks!  Shirley Crenshaw 3-5290 
beck-s	 Does it make a difference  if the information is communicated via a copy of  customer "force majeure" letter or should it only be communicated  via notes mail.     There are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial  to other departments, do you have a preference?       
beck-s	 Sally,  Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly  to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as  an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very  happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that  you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you  offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that  momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most  don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I  have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we  wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to  accomplish with their guidelines.  Please keep me up informed on this matter.  Thanks and good luck with the students.  mike
