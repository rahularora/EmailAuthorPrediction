farmer-d	 Hi, ? Am I to understand that not a single team in my adopted state  won a bowl  game?  ? I guess I will stay loyal to the CORNHUSKERS as they seemed to  handle being  pissed off about not playing in a better bowl. We need more meat  than the  big 10 can throw out. ? Well now it is down to next year again.....................   ? Did Cole get enough trucks from Santa ..................... or  did Jake eat  them? I'm sure it was fun. ? Ken 
kaminski-v	 Joe,   Thanks for your message. It would be difficult to rearrange  the meeting at  this point, given that it was  timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for  any other date at this point. We can still adjust the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work  on this with John and Ravi.

farmer-d	 Daren--  Bad news.....the Cleburne imbalance is out of control.  You might want to start some payback to Lonestar.  Lonestar's estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of May was 140.0 due them, now I guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of May shows 214.0 due them.  I am waiting to hear back from Lisa with Lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy.  Through the 16th, her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240.0 due them....the plant continues to overpull, our nom to the plant which is not all 45.0 due to Brazos' take.    Let me know what you want to do.  Mark

We need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ENE policies.  As you will see, the draft Agreement is made out with Enron in mind, even  though we have left the company name blank in the agreement.  Mohan - Last when we spoke (Friday), you were going to explore the tax  aspects of having DPC be the signing company.  Please tell us if that works.  Separately, you and Wade may need to consider how DPC lenders may look upon  some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of  it in lender domain.  Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be EIPL, ENE  Houston, or DPC.  We could also have a version where ENE Houston is signing  the contract on behalf of DPC.  Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly.  If you  would like someone in EIPL/DPC to be signing the contract, please let me  know, who the signing authority is.  I suspect, that even I could sign on  behalf of DPC or ENE ??  If so, I will be in Houston on Wednesday, and sign  at the time.  If not, you can assign someone to sign.

I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about the program and  I think that this will be  an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future.  I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.  Vince 
kaminski-v	 NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: NEAL WEINBERG on PRODUCT REVIEW OF THE WEEK Today's Focus: Videoconferencing picture clears up 03/14/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This newsletter sponsored=20 by W. Quinn ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  How to Regain The 30% of NT/2000 Server Space That's Wasted FREE! Get a grip on spiraling disk consumption and regain 30% or more of your site=01,s enterprise storage capacity. WQuinn's StorageCeNTral lets you: Monitor, track and control user disk consumption; identify & remove old files that clutter your drives; and control what types of files your users can write to your servers. Get a grip on your NT/2000 storage space -- FREE eval: http://www3.nwfusion.com/click;1022753;0;0;2;0;?http://nww1.com/go/1022753.= htm l ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Copy and paste URLs that break in two lines and remove extra spaces. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Today's Focus: Videoconferencing picture clears up --------------------------------------------------------------- By Neal Weinberg  If you=01,ve been turned off by the jumpy frames and poor audio quality associated with real-time videoconferencing, the Reviewmeister has good news for you.  There=01,s a new generation of videoconferencing end-point devices that provide business-quality pictures and sound for under $12,000.  We grabbed a box of popcorn and tested eight videoconferencing systems, using 384K bit/sec ISDN and IP connections.  In the category of videoconferencing appliances  that is, standalone systems that go in a conference room for group video sessions with colleagues or business partners  Polycom=01,s ViewStation MP was the clear winner.  The Polycom ViewStation provided outstanding video and audio quality. In addition, it was easy to install, configure and use.  In the category of PC-based products, which are especially good for virtual collaboration from your desktop, VCON=01,s MC800 was the hands- down winner, based on its high-quality components.  The beauty of these products is they allow you to have a real-time video image of the person you=01,re conferencing with in one corner of the screen, with the rest of the space available for data collaboration.  If you=01,re in the market for a system, be sure to get one with a Sony EVI D30/31 video camera; an unidirectional boundary microphone, like the Audio Technica; and a quality sound mixer. And look for remote administration and system management tools. For example, the ViewStation allows you to upgrade software, change settings, or change address book entries directly from the administrator=01,s system.  Most systems will allow you to transmit over ISDN or IP, but we found performance over IP was dragged down by IP=01,s overhead requirements. For the complete product review, go to: http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev.html  Of course, there=01,s more to videoconferencing than end points, so we whipped up an implementation guide that lays out the network topology, bandwidth and quality-of-service issues. http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev2.html  Based on our testing, the Reviewmeister says now is the time to start pilot-testing a videoconferencing system. Your chief information officer will love it when you tell him you can slash your company=01,s airline and hotel bills because you=01,ve got people from all over the company in virtual rather than face-to-face meetings.  Next week: We loaded Windows 2000 on a PC and a server and ran Gigabit Ethernet to the desktop. Guess where the bottleneck was?

beck-s	 To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the  contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been  involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real  key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is  talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional  eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job,  but we do need everyone thinking of "what if's."  Our risk books are complex,  with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of  the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the  day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our  meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our  approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on  (Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).  FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1,  and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that  I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the  Triple Lutz data room.    In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am  available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up  that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @  713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE  TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!

beck-s	 Sally,  The draft for your review and comments, as promised. The sooner I can get  this out, the sooner the trading floor gossip will stop. (no such thing as a  secret in Enron is there?).  Many thanks  Fernley   In view of the continued integration of a number of Enron global functions, I  am pleased to announce that the European Trading Support functions will, with  immediate effect, be consolidated into one operational unit. This unit, to be  headed by Barry Pearce (VP of Trading Support Operations) and based in  London, will include the European Gas, European Power and the Global Liquids  groups.  This newly created unit will work within the remit of Global Risk Management  Operations and will adopt the following core responsibilities in Europe.  1. Enhance communication and integration among all trading support operations  professionals. 2. Assure the proliferation of best operational practices.  3. Facilitate the allocation of human and systems resources.   4. Provide key training for all trading support operations personnel. 5. Co-ordinate user requirements for shared operational systems.  6. Work with ECT NA to oversee the creation of a global internal control  audit plan for trading support   activities. 7. Establish procedures for opening trading support operations offices and  create key benchmarks for   measuring on-going trading risk controls.        In this role, Barry and his team will ensure that all Enron operations in  Europe meet the extremely high standards of trading support we expect  throughout our organisation. Barry will report directly to myself and also to  Sally Beck in her capacity as head of Global Risk Management Operations.  Barry has been involved in the European Energy Operations function since 1993  and manages risk management administration, risk consolidation and reporting,  contract administration, contract settlements, cash management and trading  accounting for ECT Europe's physical commodity trading, energy derivatives  trading and financial products trading. He has been with Enron since 1992,  when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen.   Please join me in congratulating Barry in his new role and supporting him and  his team in this exciting challenge they have ahead.

kaminski-v	 Hi Eric,  Thanks for getting back to me - I believe there are a number of issues to  address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management  and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a (by no means  exhaustive) list:-  i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data  for this). iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.  Best regards,  Anjam Ahmad Research x35383

When you get a chance,  would you please send me those deal numbers.     Even though I can print reports such as the "Deal Volume Tracking Report" to  retrieve some of the deal numbers, Rita was concerned that there might be  other deals set-up in Unify, which we don't know about.

beck-s	 You asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the Analyst PRC  process...  I thought I would share a few things with you.  The primary  concern was that an individual was representing "our" people, and they 1) did  not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately  answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job  responsibilities.  Although I think the manager's in my group did an  excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts  rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy  about someone independent of our group representing them.    Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages  about the "third" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying  with the company, etc.  I think a good idea would be to provide some clear,  written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going  to work going forward.  It surer seems like it changes every 6 months...    Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sheri

farmer-d	 All:  Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.  The exception to this is as follows: If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.  Testing: Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.  Regards,  Stephen R.

He is very qualified for the work we are doing here (stochastic modeling,  curve building, option valuation,etc.) He programs in C and Matlab.  In terms of quantitative skills, Bill is better than Ren Zhang (Koch) I  talked yesterday.     The only down side Alex and I can think of about Mr. Koures is that we may not get him due  to a higher price tag.   Zimin

farmer-d	 Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I  have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda  needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.  The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.   The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial  Agreement.  Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it  really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to  HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.  Please advise.

kaminski-v	 Tara:   I am forwarding it to Vince for his approval.  It looks good although I have  three questions: 1) I presume that it is clear that Enron pays housing up to 1500/month.   Anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with.Utility bills are not  included unless part of the rent, right?  This should be clarified; as you  know, Houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket-book. 2) Economy class plane.  Can we even do that?  I thought Enron policy was for  a B-class ticket for flights over 6 hours. 3) 500lbs of transport.  I don't know if this is a big ticket item, but I  would give him less, 250 say, if it would save Enron considerable expense.  Regards, Grant.

kaminski-v	 Clayton,  I agree. This would happen when there is an insufficient pipeline capacity to move gas. The market developments you describe happen quite often and this is one of the reasons we want to have the model you are working on.  Vince  Vince      Clayton Vernon@ENRON 01/17/2000 09:30 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: one more thing  Vince-  I forgot to mention to you one other development I propose, a theory I call  "uncoupling" of basis. As an example, severe cold weather specific to the  Midwest can result in an elevation of spot market prices at Henry Hub, where  prices elsewhere in the Northeast are such that the basis appears to be less  than the commodity charge to ship gas from Louisiana to the Northeast. This  can happen when gas is not being moved in the spot market from Louisiana to  the Northeast at that time.  The notion of "equilibrium" cannot, in my view,  always assume "spot" gas is flowing along all nodes of the network.  Clayton  
kaminski-v	 Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly  Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting,  followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.  In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203  merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be  determined to be "workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next  steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are  provided below.  FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process  FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as  discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.  According to FERC, the draft Order:  -  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines; -  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses. -  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns; and -  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements.  The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal  Register.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the  Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC  should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC  should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did  mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis.  Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated  that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "efficient yet  sufficient".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.  Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would  improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt,  Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also  stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's  concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail  competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and  analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will  provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry.  Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said  that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their  own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the  RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to  preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more  mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably.  NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably  Competitive  In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and  deadlines for resolution/implementation.  In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000  compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found  that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the  ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve  market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an "imperfect  solution," yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls.  Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the ISO's progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.  In other action, FERC accepted NYISO's and NEPOOL's proposed Emergency Energy  Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service  to each other (ER00-3638-000);  Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOL's 64th Agreement Amendment proposing  the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).                                 == RECENT FERC FILINGS ==  (1) RTO DEVELOPMENTS  *  ISO NE submitted its changes to Market Rule 17, Market Monitoring,  Reporting and Market Power Mitigation, in compliance with the Commission's  July 26, 2000 Order.

beck-s	 Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out  The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment  from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability  to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and  I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting  this change  The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any  system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver  completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks  in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in  delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of  meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we  will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve  input validation processes on trade date.  Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to  deliver  Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy  is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline (  Houston 4 AM ) Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM ) Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline (  Houston 11AM )  James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible  changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in  addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of  delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in  delivering a trade date control process.  I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we  are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control.  Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

We are today implementing a flash P&L  process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start  today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions  and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of  flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston.    I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes  into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and  the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised  tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is  just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most  serious problem.

farmer-d	 Vance,  The issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system, per  Cheryl Jones, effective 2/00.  Therefore, any purchases at that point, for  02/00 forward, are UA4 and are probably having a negative impact on your  accrual.  I think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level?   There have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination, so, I  don't know where exactly the term Calpine deal is, physically.  Your  assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated.  Mary

farmer-d	 I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates:   Mar 11-31    15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045   April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.  An  outage occurred on the 5th, so the deliveries to Mobil didn't acutally start  until the   12th.  If you need anything else, let me know.

beck-s	 This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option  pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and  calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls  are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will  result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index  premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.  In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) -  which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index  -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to  reflect the difference in strikes.  If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.  Thank You,  Larry May

kaminski-v	 Vince-  Something very interesting about natural gas storage (from the class).  The industry is rapidly adopting what are called "Operational Balancing  Agreements," where the pipeline contracts with the producers and LDC's  (public utilities) to handle all "imbalances" in shipping, namely all  production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise.  Shippers then  always "book" what is scheduled to happen, and not what actually happens.   The end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions  are used to smooth out not only weekday-weekend seasonal patterns (the  well-known "parking") but to insure issues of wellhead output as well.  Cutting to the chase, storage facilities in producing regions are operated to  insure the integrity of the pipeline system, and estimated marketed  production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline's  receipt meter than is production less local storage.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  I'm really feeling like a blind mouse about this because I haven't (nor has  Christie, Mike and Mark) read Mr. Mehta's comments.  I believe that we would  be better equipped to discuss the course of action that should be taken, if  any, after we are well versed with Mr. Mehta and his perspectives.  Although, I do suggest that if we do decide to proceed, we should approach it  by addressing the issues Mr. Mehta discussed under a different premise, i.e.  sponsor a speaking engagement where one of the speakers' topics would be  related to Mr. Mehta's topic - allowing us to strategically tell our side of  the story without it appearing that this is a planned rebuttal.  We should  specifically invite those who attended Mr. Mehta's engagement, but not limit  it to this group.  Let's all discuss this once our group has read Mr. Mehta' comments.  Regard,   Cindy       
kaminski-v	 Everyone,  Several of us have talked about starting an ongoing meeting that we can use  as a platform to discuss various transmission issues.    I invite everyone to our first meeting, I have received names from several  different sources for the invitation list.  If any of you feel that others  should be present please let me know.  Vince has agreed that the research group will sponsor this activity and our  first meeting is scheduled for Friday, December 8th.,  from 11:30 - 1:00.   Please RSVP to Anita Dupont whether or not you will be able to attend and  your lunch preference for sandwiches or salads.  Anita's extension is 30329  and her e-mail is adupont@enron.com.

kaminski-v	 Kevin,  Per your request, please see below:  ****************************************************************************** *************************************** New Facsimile Machine Information  Please take a look @ the following and let me know, which FAX machine you  choose or if you need information on something smaller, then I will have the  Vendor contact you directly to finalise installation.  An Enron Director or  above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will  have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be  installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but  either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a "Loaner" should you have  a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep  when ordering the equipment.  If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail  to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the  installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail  "ECT Address Book".  If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.  If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha  Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.  If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via  Notes-Mail.   A note on the fax machines listed below: All the machines listed below come with a 2nd paper tray and Upgraded memory  {Maxed by model~See Below} as an Enron Standard from each Vendor. All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus  the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should  be noticeably quicker. Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the  Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only} Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included  in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges +  paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}  Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a  Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various  models.  If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some  considerations: No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine  placement on EB30 or EB31. Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG  compression {or equivalent}. Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models  quoted are loaded}. Maintenance is to be INCLUDED in Monthly Cost {Models quoted are covered}.   *********************  From Pitney Bowes   PB2050   COST: $95.00 per month on RENTAL Enron Specs: This model has 10megs of memory + a 2nd paper tray as standard.

Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 -  this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a  1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.    Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so  this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.    Let me know your thoughts.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit. o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember  correctly). Steve has a much higher value to Enron than Anjam.

kaminski-v	 Hi Shirley,   This email is in reference to your vmail regarding my rescheduling my  meeting on tomorrow at 2 pm with Vince.  That is fine with me because the  Credit guys (Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman) have had a change in strategy.   They have asked us to take some time to evaluate Moody's Riskcalc software.   Therefore I have had to put the Duffie project on hold for the last few  days.  However I am about two thirds through the Duffie documents and will  resume studying them as soon as I get through the lengthy RiskCalc documents.   Let me know if he still wants to meet later in the week  Thanks, Iris.

kaminski-v	 Vince:  I enjoyed meeting you last week to discuss my application to join your group.  Please keep my inquiry confidential for now.  If selected, I think your group would greatly benefit from my diverse  skill-set including modeling skills utilizing Excel, Access, and Bloomberg as well as graphing, statistical, and other quantitative abilities,  especially in the meteorology field.  I am particularly interested in being able to discover vital information  which may affect the markets (e.g. pulp/paper, interest rates, weather) as  well as arriving at a new variable which captures all market variables into  one which may be followed and forecasted for each of the groups.  Furthermore, I am truly committed to adding value to your group, including  making significant contributions, and am sanguine about my ability to ensure that these achievements are  well-received.  I have met many people at Enron thus far and am able to utilize these  strategic alliances by knowing who may be able to assist your group in the quest for information on different projects. By  accessing information quickly, both internal and  external to the firm, the group would be able to extraordinarily benefit from  this diligence  In addition, by seeking greater efficiencies in my work,  I have been able to be instrumental in accumulating additional  responsibilities.   Most importantly, I have the mathematical acumen and insight to ensure the  continued growth and prosperity of your group.  As a research-oriented individual, I am clearly interested in pursuing a  position in your  group. If selected, I would be able to bring my diverse experience, including  financial modeling and derivatives, from my tenure at Enron and CIBC World Markets.  I look forward to meeting with select members of your group.  Thanks, David 3-3528

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very= =20 specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20 transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20 site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se= ll=20 at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi= cal=20 eCommerce concept) into a true market.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20 dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are= =20 correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro= n.  Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20 opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20 Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a= =20 broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately= =20 be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20 wholesale, retail and broadband services.

To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these= =20 new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan= t=20 functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban= d.  Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi= ke=20 McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20 Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20 Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20 Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20 North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20 Committee.

Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before I make my final decision.  Thanks in advance,  Giuseppe Paleologo   -- Giuseppe A.

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince, Stinson  Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more clearly.  We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships  (RA) for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental requirement.  Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September, just before school starts.  I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please, let me know how you would like to proceed.  Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive  collaboration during the coming year and beyond.  Best Regards,  Nick   PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area in October.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DRAFT of letter to be sent from Enron to Stanford.

beck-s	 Just wanted to let you know a few updates:  1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.  We are going to prototype the  first window, Market Penetration.  The prototype will give us something with  sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on  functionality.   Hopefully, we will have something in 2 weeks.  2) The previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from  the prototype.  The estimates are $1.6M for phase I and $1.6M for remaining  phases.  3) Included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389K for the purchase of  customer prospect data from Dun & Bradstreet.  The $389K is an O&M expense  amount that was not included in the 2000 budget.  This amount combined with  other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D&B results in an overall  budget impact over the next 12 months of $278K.  I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request  of Philippe Bibi.  George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from  D&B.  Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate  better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D&B.  This  could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready  to go for implementation.  I believe I can give George some time to try  something, but when it comes down to it, $389K isn't that much money.   Therefore, I suggest that if we don't have anything negotiated in the next  three weeks, we sign the current proposal from D&B and move forward.    D&B  is currently threatening (a negotiation tactic, I think) to pull their  development resources off of this project until they receive a signed  agreement.  In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our  delivery of Global Entelligence, we can provide a letter of intent to keep  them moving or sign the proposal at that time.  Give me a call at 3-6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items.

beck-s	 Just to give you all a heads up...  Jeff Skilling has asked for a revenue number for EOL that represents what  Enron reports on our financial statements (including the Mark-to-Market value  of all of our open positions resulting from EOL trading).   We are  specifically looking for MTM value as of the close of trading on the 15th and  would like to be able to review the results by mid-afternoon (Houston) on the  16th.   We will need each desk to calculate their EOL-specific MTM value and  consolidate this information at the Commodity Group level (ie. U.S. Power,  Global Liquids, N. American Gas, etc.) and return it to the Product Control  Group (Torrey Moorer/Carrie Southard) by mid-afternoon on the 16th (Houston)  in order to combine the information into a report for delivery on the 17th.    We are primarily interested in the total MTM value of our open EOL positions,  but if it is possible to provide a breakout for the MTM value of EOL physical  sales, this would help us break out the revenue numbers.   If you have  questions, please contact Torrey Moorer at x36218.   Thank you! Sheri

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please  select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores  Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take  dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough  sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst  recruiting teams.  In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of  these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be  given for attending this workshop.

kaminski-v	 Hello Vince,  My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les Clewlow, who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at Warwick Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets - hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently come to my attention :  "The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.  and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.  Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at University of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK, where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach (spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.  Thanks in advancve  Bernard Murphy 
kaminski-v	 Goodmorning Liz ,  Hopefully your morning is going well.  Liz, we are currently moving up to the 32nd floor as you are already aware of. I had been speaking with Brenda concerning the move however , things has changed since then.  Liz , I need for you to understand the importance  of me knowing exactly when and where we will move.  First of all - the space , we have several machines that must move with us.  Secondly - We must make arrangements for our satellite , the cable may need adjusting.  Thirdly - I need to know where every copy machine is located on the floor and hopefully we are closest to the largest one.  Please Liz, these are most important. We prepare for morning meetings daily and we are the first to get  here to work,  so if any problems occur we try and tackle them beforehand.  Please I know that you are very busy however , this will really be helpful in making our move a success.  Maybe we can meet and discuss?                                                                      Thank You                                                                    Kevin Moore

Delainey, J. Shankman, and J. Lavorato.  Here is a brief overvi= ew=20 of the meeting objective:  Purpose To gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing=20 consolidated trade information with centralized access.  Background The definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information=20 originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into=  a=20 common database repository.  The idea of an Enron =01&Trade Warehouse=018= =20 originated from members of the London office and has been expanded to inclu= de=20 the Houston systems.  The need for a Trade Warehouse stems from the=20 requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal=20 information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.   Currentl= y,=20 deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product=20 process flows from mid to back office, and across product lines. The=20 information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easi= ly=20 accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products=20 within Enron. Given this current architecture, it is very difficult and=20 costly to access timely, quality-assured, and consolidated cross-product de= al=20 information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.  Proposal Houston will use the warehouse as the data source for EnTelligence and=20 numerous analytical reporting application systems.  These analytical=20 reporting application systems can include, but are not limited to,=20 Operational Pricing Module (OPM), EnronOnline, and Daily Position Report=20 (DPR).  Once the warehouse is in place, it may be used as the source for=20 additional downstream systems as well as Investor Relations reporting.  
kaminski-v	 As the Global VP/MD mid-year PRC draws closer, I want to take the opportunity  to stress to you the importance of  updating your profile information in the  GIS system.

kaminski-v	 Celeste,  We need to make sure that the interns in Vince's group are coordinated and  incorporated with the rest of the summer associates.  They should be offered  the same starting dates, I believe they are May 22, 2000 June 5, 2000.  I am  not sure about the June date.  Would you check and let Vince know.

kaminski-v	 I have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior  to a possible meeting with them.  Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy  2) completeness and 3) coverage  of the areas we want to explore.  As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil  reserves are 1,000 billion bbls.  Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would  add only 0.1 %.  While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not  looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time  frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the last.  However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon and I wasn't sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow.  The only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro plus the addition of "Unused information" at the end of the document.  The unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories, press releases, and random thoughts.  We probably won't use any of this stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful.  The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.  This may be best done through examples or in some other way.  I think that our audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don't interrupt the flow of the article.  If you'll make a pass at what you feel is appropriate I'll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what you are doing myself.  Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience.  You guys make a wonderful "lab".  Sally and I are driving to Louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then driving to New Orleans and back to Waco by Saturday.

Can the deal be extended  for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume  Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?  Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497

kaminski-v	 Dear all,  Please see attached spreadsheet - we will have to think of a way to automate  the position update - right now it's a manual process to convert the text  file that Andreas sends us to proper spreadsheet format and then pivot table  the results - only takes about 20 minutes to do this however.  Note that the  version 1a VaR model links via VLOOKUP to the spreadsheet attached (as you  know, we have to use VLOOKUP because MG does not necessarily have positions  in all forward months, whilst the pivot table only produces numbers for  forward months with a position).

kaminski-v	 Bernard,  Yes, I can  read a DVI file. You can also  cc my home address: Vkaminski@aol.com. I shall try to send you an answer to your question on weekend.

The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or the External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options - rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.  In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :  1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is "incomplete" (synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) - note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with 'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and Das and;  2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the price of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).   Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets - hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.

beck-s	 Sally,  Dolores Muzzy, Celeste Roberts' assistant was attempting to schedule a  meeting to discuss the Commercial Services program.  The reason that Dolores  is trying to schedule a meeting is follows: (1)  Celeste and I were scheduled to speak briefly at Rick's staff meeting on  Tuesday, April 11th as we had at Cliff Baxter's on March 27th.  However, we  were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the  discussion may have been extensive, Rick agreed that it made more sense to  schedule a meeting in which the Commercial Services program was the sole  topic of discussion.  (2) You and I had exchanged voice mails on March 27th, immediately after  Cliff's staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individuals  who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding  questions about the management of the program.  You indicated that you would  facilitate scheduling the meeting.  However, given that I had not heard from  you and Celeste had told Rick we would schedule a meeting, it seemed to make  sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of  the same individuals and cover the same questions.  I have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you  expressed to Dolores.  However, given that we told Rick that we would  schedule a meeting, we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip  through the cracks.  We will attempt to be available whenever it is  convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together.  If you wish  to schedule a meeting immediately, our availability is as follows:  Friday, April 14th from 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. Monday, April 17th from 9:30 - 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, April 18th from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. or 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, April 19th from 9:00 - 11:30 a.m.  If these dates don't work please don't hesitate to suggest others.   We look  forward to meeting with you.  Thanks  Charlene  P.S. My schedule gets pretty crazy so if you could let me know as soon as  possible what date works for you I can be sure to hold the time.  Thanks.

I am attaching a copy of the draft program agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston meeting a step farther by making this next session a more technically-oriented meeting.  There are two spots you may wish to consider:  1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had in mind for the case study. 2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.  I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.  I hope you can join us.  Ron Henderson Infocast 818-888-4445 ext. 28 ronh@informationforecast.com   CASE STUDY GUIDELINES 1. Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR, Southern California.  1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in Pennsylvania. 2. Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily NYMEX close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999. 3. Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why these models were considered. Candidate models should be described mathematically and verbally. 4. Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared, Akaike information criterion. 5. Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The estimation procedure employed should be briefly described. 6. Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented. 7. If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.  Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case study may include other things.     - Draft Agenda v.2.doc

If there is a specialist in your team, we have not received a  survey from this person.  This lack of information prevents your expenses  from being 100% allocated out to the commercial teams.

beck-s	 Dear Tim,  Thanks for the info.  We have followed up on all points noted in the first  review and have found a couple more.  We will want to discuss these on Monday.  I should be able to send you the Doorstep reports for St. Louis and Chicago  (updated) once David and Bjorn get a chance to review them.  Best regards  Shona       Tim Poullain-Patterson@ECT 11/03/2000 03:22 AM To: Marcelo Parra/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Naomi Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, Shona  Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Robert Soeldner/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Chicago Doorstep Review    Thanks for the update - as you say, hopefully this summary covers all the  issues. Shona?  Point #2 comes up in Doorstep after Doorstep. It was discussed extensively  upon being raised in the Singapore Doorstep and Andy Cowx (Telecoms expert  for Enron Europe) researched potential solutions without success. I can't  help but feel that as this is a global issue, a global solution/answer needs  to be found. Shona - can you take this up with either Sally or Ted and find  someone accountable for coming up with a global answer.  Point #4 per the updated list of Authorised Traders and follow up note to Sam  Hainsworth defining scope of what Chicago and Montreal may/may not do, any  residual position that Chicago may "create" is pre-authorised by Sam and is  an integral part of his global book. I have forwarded the follow up note to  Shona this morning, and confirmed with Sam that he has communicated the  contents with his staff in those offices, i.e. no local limits, however  small, are required!  Point #5 Lou's list of AS400 development needs has been prioritised and  depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are,  this should be done in the very near future.  Point #10 we considered preserving the Helsinki typewriter in perspex, as a  reminder to us all, however I am assured it has now been destroyed. Suggest  that once the forms have been converted, this machine is rendered useless,  e.g. remove the "e" key or take a spanner to it!  Per the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business - I will  assume that the timing is acceptable to Houston unless we hear concerns to  the contrary.  Thanks and regards, Tim     Marcelo Parra@MGUSA 02/11/2000 22:46 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Tim Poullain-Patterson/LON/ECT@ECT, Naomi  Connell/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Chicago Doorstep Review  Please find Derek's report on the visit by the Houston Risk/Controlling  team.  Assuming that this summary covered all the issues, it seems that we  are making progress.    Point # 1 - The problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to  the other Enron office.  I agree that the sooner the move takes place the  better but let's make sure that they are properly set up in the new office  prior to their move.  The critical part of the move is to assure that  availability to the AS400 is established, prior to the move. Point #2 - Using cell phones needs to be addressed.  How are you controlling  this in London and other offices? Once we transfer the Scrap business to London (Jan. 2000) we will not have  position issues in Chicago.  Until that time comes please note that Chicago  has been instructed not to take any positions.  In the event of an unbalanced  book, with an agreement from Sam, they will need a small limit..  Tim, Can  you formalize this with Sam (see point 4 below) for good order sake? Point # 5 - We need a better customer exposure report from the AS400.  Mike  Sweeny should  help us on this front. Point # 10 - "Russia/Bills of Lading/Typewriter"  - Helsinki is still fresh  in our minds.  What can I say.  I told them to unplug the machine. Point # 11- Stephanie reporting to Lou is not a problem.  Derek doing  logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away  all the middle office functions from his control.  Please let me know if you hear anything different.

farmer-d	 Just so everyone is on the same page:  Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new "tokenized  period" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is  to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.   This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month  increments.  It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to  the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with  Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled  internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara  bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be  heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These  trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.  An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and  Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human  intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this  nature will have to be entered manually.  How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL  product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.   The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what  is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal  accordingly.    For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:    Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara  ticket      Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07    04/10  04/14    04/17  04/21    04/24  04/28      Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing   Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.   Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open  ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date  is on the path; otherwise  the number of reconciling items will increase.  Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.  Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.  SRM (x33548)

beck-s	 Sally,   This is my stab at a consolidated list from the last 2 weeks.  We may have to  change the format to capture all the issues and explanations, but I wanted  you to have this for your meeting today.

I'll be working  with the business analyst to take over this reporting later this week, so  please comment at your convenience.   Debbie 
beck-s	 Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial  confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have  been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the  most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not  happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation  went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is  there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the  financial confirmations to Calgary.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT on 07/18/2000  02:10 PM ---------------------------

Please let me know  if you need any travel arrangements made.  Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to  take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you  will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to  stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street,  take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews  (the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross "Ruthvan" (1st  stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on  your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg.  and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby  on the 19th floor.

farmer-d	 Hi Daren,  I'm attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report  (Revenue Volume Comparison Report).  Howard apprised me, in a meeting last  week, that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is  due to no volumes being scheduled in POPS but volumes appearing in MOPS.  The  volumes @ this meter is for 4449 (Sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697.  Due  to this being a "check meter" the volumes will not bridge to POPS from MOPS.   I'd like to request to revise the nome of 4449 to show "0" instead.  Can you  approve this modification?  Thanks -Jackie-

kaminski-v	 Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510) with additional questions.  Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long-term contracts (price and term). The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan  to 1) pass on "court ordered rate increases" and 2) issue revenue bonds. Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of "endless  appeals" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes. Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy. Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a  ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate  hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.  Legislation and Bail Out Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations  yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill  is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said  Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.    Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of  the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.  According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court  battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that  California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity  charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot  initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.    A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would  still hit about one half of all consumers (since the "baseline" is set at 60%  of average consumption), but it is "progressive" in a politically important  sense.   Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.    The company's defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   "Every time you think  there's a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,  something like this happens," one legislator moaned.  Long-Term Contracts  A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying  contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  "We got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones," one  official told our source.   "The idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,  'you want in on this with these terms?'   We think we'll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy."  Bankruptcy  Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that  California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).  We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los  Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at  the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis.   Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.   The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis" by not making deep  spending cuts, "including scaling back management salaries."  The auditors  also questioned the utility's decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.   "Basically, they took the money and ran," as State Senate Speaker Burton put  it yesterday.  What appears to be Governor Gray Davis' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult.  Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full  public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period.   That's something California cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.   Court Battle Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in  mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.  PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid  so-called "stranded costs," they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.   Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until  February 14th at the state government's request.  As that deadline  approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ("the courts made me do it"), but on the other hand, they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout.  "We'll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily."  One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a  settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps  even the year after. "Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and  get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme  Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We don't think  the creditors will be quite that patient."

beck-s	 I haven't checked with all of my Managers, but I know at least some of them  sent you their Satisfactory reviews and had not heard anything back from you  by 7/31 which I think was the original deadline for completing reviews.   And  I know that although I received feedback from you on my Needs Improvement  employees, I didn't receive any formal feedback on my Satisfactory employees  reporting directly to me.  I believe I recall a phone conversation that we  had where you told me to go ahead and give the Satisfactory reviews.  At that  point, I told all of my Managers to proceed with completing the reviews on  their Satisfactory employees.  I believe that all of my department's reviews  have been executed and turned in - save one for an Analyst as I am still  waiting to hear feedback from his PRC rep.    So, based on your explanation  of AnneMarie's memo, I guess I would like clarification.  Are any of the 51  in my department?  Because, it could be that we went ahead and gave them when  we were trying to get everything wrapped up in early August and be as timely  as possible in giving constructive feedback to our employees based on our  phone conversation - and that you're still waiting for us to provide them to  you for review.  What I mean by it is ridiculous to wait so long to  communicate performance feedback is : September?    Sorry for any confusion.

beck-s	 Dear Ms. Beck,  I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.  As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective. This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer, I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.  I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world. The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you!  Sincerely,  Natalie Carnes   - Resume4.doc 
farmer-d	 Becky,  Can we get a copy of this filing? I have a meeting with Mitchell next Wednesday and I would like to know more about the filing and will find out more about the pipeline.

farmer-d	 I cant figure out what to make of this...   -----Original Message----- From: 
kaminski-v	 The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures  in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of  events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include  customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.    ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this  memo.  The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the  threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to  $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and  events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.  1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer  events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events  with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public  Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman  2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract  negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department  will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they  can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department  will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program  and ENA.  3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting  documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a  detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please  submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR  department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the  form.  4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of  the Chairman for final approval.  Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for  various local sporting events and concerts.  If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance  planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie  Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.  Thank you for your cooperation.

beck-s	 Sally,  As I told you last week, I laid a big egg and "put the cat amongst the  pigeons" as Steve Stock put it.  Phillipe called a meeting with Rick (and  me), Debbie Brackett and Steve yesterday to "clear the air".  While he  pledged to be attentive to the problem (as I articulated), he still focused  on fixing process which I fear gets us to where we thought we were as opposed  to where we need to be.  I continue to believe that not only are there things  just plain broken, but what we have gotten used to as "acceptable" is now  inadequate.  This includes the ability for "human" systems and processes to  be automated to avoid stupid downstream data problems as well as improve  analytics.  You will be cordially invited to be (another) weekly meeting that  both Rick and Phillipe plan to attend to monitor and guide progress. Ted       
farmer-d	 I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you  could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for  which she is looking.  She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA &  HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to  accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is  doing off of HPL's pipe.  I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity  on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will  this give me everything that I need?  Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in  Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas  on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --   ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?  Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some  of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any  ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!  Thanks in advance. 
beck-s	 Yes. I was thinking local. We need to talk with Maryann Long.  He will almost certainly work with Fallon and Hannon at EBS. He is the one  looking to move and the position as I understand it has no timeframe (2 years  plus). My recommendation is no FSP, Housing, Education or Equalisation. Renew  his contract (expires shortly if I recall correctly) and pay him some money  up front in cash/options to cover housing and education for first 2 years  plus standard relo/house sale.  David     Tara Rozen 04/17/2000 08:30 AM To: David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jane Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: B Pearce  David  Barry just left me an urgent message for me to call him back to discuss his  move to Houston. He said that he spoke with you about a package but you were  "vague" and he wanted more concrete details. There must have been a reason  you were vague!! Were you thinking local deal? He definitely mentioned "expat  terms" in the voicemail over 20 times so that is not his idea.  Any idea of why this move is taking place? He wants to bring UK people over  with him as well so definitely want to send the right message.  Thanks Tara

kaminski-v	 Hi Anne!  Thank you for your reply.  Enron is delighted to be a part of the Wharton  Business Plan Competition!  First, our assistant in the University Affairs Group, Melinda McCarty, will  provide you with our logo.  Enron would definitely like to be Judge in Phase III and Participate in the  Venture Fair, including the display table.  As to the mentoring and University community program, let;s discuss that  further so I can better judge our way forward.  After I've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire University  Affairs and Wharton team here at Enron, you and I can get together to plan a  more difinitive participatory strategy for Enron.  I will call you next week.  Again, we at Enron are very enthusiastic about participation with Wharton in  this mutually interesting endeavor.!

Things  are moving along nicely with the  competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some  statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase  I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let  me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.  * We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we  could get your logo.  * Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair  (VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business  plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon  *  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The  VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture  capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in  Philadelphia on April 30th.  * At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot  table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you  wish to use the exhibit space.  *  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one  mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day  commitment.  *  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.   Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?  I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank  you.

beck-s	 Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although  obviously it's you.   We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining  Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations.  Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim  Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going  day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.  Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever  expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in  place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location.  Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations  will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this  role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group  to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back  office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract  Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group  will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the  timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key  operational procedures and processes are implemented.     Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur  Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral  part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe.  He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading  Support Operations.   Please join us in wishing Barry  success in his new role.

kaminski-v	 Congratulations on your promotion--well deserved!! Lucy 
kaminski-v	 I have included provision for providing rank correlation between "jump  occurrence in daily average power price" and "outage occurrence".  The model  will provide the same claim distribution as before when PriceVsOutage  Correlation = 0 is used.  Claim goes up as the correlation is increased.  I  have performed some sensitivity analysis and the results seem to make sense.    The new model workbook is "OutagePricingModel040901.xls" and corresponding  dll is "OutagePricing040901.dll", both located in  O:\GRM\RESEARCH\OUTAGERISK\  subdirectory.  The price vs. outage rank  correlation input will need to be provided in "MAIN" spreadsheet.  Please  call me if you have any questions.  -Amitava

They are very  small. We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so  that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a  designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily. This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not  all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same. Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some  originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some  execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute  trades).   is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit. Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of  office Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved  We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time. Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.  It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for  the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch  that, as was evidenced by EOTT.  Are you both happy with this approach? Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?  Thanks, Richard         
beck-s	 David,  The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with  one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the  sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any  customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales  person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day,  then they will be red carded.  I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised  traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with  Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as  well as Marcelo's operational plan.  Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial  (Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

beck-s	 I have a few questions regarding the transition.   Access Programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end-users they  are supporting from now on.  The budget dollars for them are in CC 103849 -  $50K per month.  Do you want each department to continue paying their  invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost  centers ?  Do we transfer budget dollars? Close the cost center?    Equipment - We have 1 flat screen and several large monitors.  Should we just  return all equipment to surplus or offer to others?  Space - Will CommodityLogic be moving and assuming the space that will be  vacated on 3/12?  Fax machine will be disconnected/returned.  Digital Scanner will be surplused.  There are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else (CL?)  wants/needs them.  TurkeyLegs and Tarzan.    I currently charge 50% of my time to CL and 50% to my cost center - 103850.   Should I continue this or charge all my time to CL and close my cost center  ?  Since Marvia is also be redeployed, there is no one else in my cost center.  Let me know if you want to sit down and discuss or you can just provide quick  answers here or in voice mail.

Of  course, there are some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.  Vince

farmer-d	 Per Mary, Sitara can not handle it either.  It can calculate and withhold  volume from the deal as a % for fuel, but not as part of the price.  Steve  says this is a nightmare for the Denver office.  Can you take the "To Do" to  follow-up on this throughout the systems, and get back with Ed to further  discuss?  I'd really appreciate it.     Michael Eiben 06/22/2000 01:09 PM To: Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lisa Csikos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary M  Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pat  Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Edward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Fuel    We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what %  HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our  fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think  that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel  retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up  with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.   Currently, this process is not in place.       
kaminski-v	 Ted,          An update on the implementation for FFVols:                   (1) In comparing 6 days of historical Var calculations  (with that of the implied) for Agg-Gas, we have found that the Historical VaR  calculations are consistently lower over this period, by roughly 17 MM.  The  implied volatilities are much higher at this period, anticipating strong  winter prices.                   (2) At this time, the consensus is not to relase the  historical implementation into production, and the official line to traders  will be that the method is still in testing.  The historical VaR is 19.2MM  and the implied is 37 MM for effective date of 09/25.                       (3) Further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology  (which I mentioned last week, whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio  of prompt to historical-prompt volatilities), to atleast  capture some  implied/forward effects.  Tanya's analysis on a  fictitious portfolio  indicates higher VaR numbers, but poorer backtesting in comparison to the  historical approach.  This approach serves as an intermediate, and seems  appropriate in periods such as the current one, wherein the historical  numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied.                (4) Winston will start  testing using these hybrid vols, and  if the results are deemed satisfactory, that will be the production  methodology.  Of course, we will obtain all VaR numbers concurrently to serve as different  indicators and beacons of risk.  The production number will hopefully be a  sensible compromise of the different methods.   Regards Naveen

farmer-d	 Send me a request of who you want, and I will make the transaction this evening...expecting that no one ahead of you in the waiver ranking makes a bid for the same person.

kaminski-v	 Hi Shalesh:  The move team has informed me that they will not be able to move your telephone until Wednesday, the 23rd.    I have asked them to bring you boxes by Friday, but I have not heard back from them.  Your computer is here, but without a telehone, you may not want to move down here until the 23rd.  Just to let you know.  Have a great day!  Shirley 
kaminski-v	 Vince  Thanks - based on a "speed read" it would appear that SRM sits neatly in the  volumetric part of your framework. Regarding systems I am keen to preserve  the work Kevin has already done and I suspect we can eventually use the  visualization tools in the RisktRAC front end to display the results should  we require.  To be honest, I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a  framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the "angry  lone voice" in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art  of risk management generally travel in a similar direction !  I shall make sure our efforts remain in congruence.

farmer-d	 Gary:  HPL received  volumes at the above meter during 1/1/99 thru 6/99.  Prior to  1/1/99, ENA was purchasing some of the volumes from I P Petroleum under  contract #016-44386-102; Deal #341832.   This deal expired 12/31/99, but the  volumes continued to flow and be allocated to I P Petroleum by Pioneer.    Since there was no deal to cover these volumes, these volumes were allocated  to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.    Volume Mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from  someone, but never received one.  Here are the months and volumes that need resolution:  Prod. Mth Mmbtus Jan. 99    6,510  Feb. 99    6,395 Mar. 99  14,789 Apr. 99  16,866 May. 99    8,415 Jun.  99  13,858  Total  66,833   Possible Solution:  1.  Need a Deal to cover the periods in question, or 2.  Provide authorization to writeoff the volumes.

kaminski-v	 Professor Ronn:  Thank you for your email and I wish to respond as follows:   I have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a  hotel reservation closer into town.  I will let you know.   I have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen  installed.  However, there is really not room for a lectern.  The overhead  will  sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part  of the table for their presentation copies.   I will be glad to make copies for you, however, it would be a big help if you  could email me a copy of your presentation on Wednesday.  Thursday  mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have  time to make the copies.  I hope this meets with your approval.  Please let me know if you need  anything else.  We look forward to your visit.  Regards,  Shirley Crenshaw 713/853-5290 email: Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com

beck-s	 One of Market Risk's primary responsibilities is to review Enron's trading  activities and provide feedback to management, and management's expectation  is that this is feedback and analysis is provided at the beginning of the  Houston trading day.  Global Risk Management Operations in Houston is now  providing Market Risk with a Enron Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior to 8  a.m. Houston time, for use in Market Risk's morning meeting where we review  all of Enron's trading activities from the prior day.  The only information  missing from this is the UK, and I understand we do not receive the London  DPR until 10:30a.m, 4:30pm your time.   I'm sure you're working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day, but  meanwhile, we'd like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can  consolidate for Houston management's use first thing in the morning, as  decisions need to be made each day based on Enron's consolidated exposure,  etc..   We understand they're preliminary, but we work off preliminary #s  from Houston, and I expect with the 6 hour time difference, your preliminary  #s will be much firmer than ours.  We can start with just P/L and VaR, so  it's not that many #s we need.  I'm hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds  complete we'll be able to see positions earlier as well.  Please let us know when we can begin receiving this information.  Thank you,  Cassandra Schultz VP, Market Risk Management work 713 853 0429 cell 713 858 2618 home 936 321 2185 
beck-s	 Sally,  I tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so I decide to  send you a very important e-mail. You told me to contact you if I was ever  considering leaving my current job so I am doing so at this time. I want to  say that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most  impressive employee at Enron at any level. I feel comfortable speaking with  you and appreciate all of your advice. I am not totally unhappy with the  recruiting part of my job, I just feel that I do not "buy into" everything  that is happening in my group. There are many necessary changes that are  needed and I feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction. I  just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of Enron because I feel  that my strength is selling. I would like to at least get an interview with  Enron Broadband because I know that they are filling up there retail sales  groups. Although I do not have all the technical experience, I know people  who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience. As you  know, it is who you know and I do not have a relationship with David Cox or  any of the retail folks in broadband. I was hoping that you would give David a call and  see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups.  Brent has called over to David and I feel if you were to call also, it would  help.  Sally, let me know if this will be ok and I would like to get on your  calendar to discuss further. Nobody in my group knows that I am looking for  another job so please keep this confidential. I can not tell  how much I  value your opinion and advice in matters especially  like these. Thank you so  much and I look forward  to hearing from you soon.    George Hope

farmer-d	 FROM SANDI BRABAND:  Attached is an initial draft of a Gas Management Services and Agency  Agreement with Tenaska IV.  It should be reviewed internally only and not  forwarded beyond those on the above distribution list without first checking  with me or Barbara Gray.  Pat Radford, my assistant, will be making  arrangements for a meeting next week to discuss the agreement as well as the  Cornhusker structure generally.  I will be out of town until the 25th.  If there is an urgent issue that needs  resolution before my return, please contact Barbara Gray at 36832.   
farmer-d	 We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan  2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting  spreadsheet if you need it.  Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113 Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11    I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser  ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we  do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that  only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just  going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.    I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so  you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.  Thanks, Megan

farmer-d	 In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma  (#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance  at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of  this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some  of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have  not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the  extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a  hit when these actual volumes flow through.  I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a  problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.   Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving  correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

farmer-d	 Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you  have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone  should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of  your favorites.    The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now.   Attached is the URL for user to run the application.  http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com  Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the  application.   Here is the steps they should do:  1) Launch Internet Explorer  2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and  click on above URL)  3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If  they don't see any messages, there are two reasons:   (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT  Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names  into the group.  (2) There is no new messages added yet.  4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window  when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the  messages after typing the  messages into the text box:  (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or  (2) click on "send" button to send the message.  5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main  window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message  in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.  However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10  second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will  be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the  messages.  6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean  them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.  Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I  will move it into production environment soon.  Let me know any feedbacks.  Thanks,  Fangming

I did not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in Enron.  As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I have been working two years as Lead Scientist and Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue Management Inc. in Houston.  I developed and implemented the mathematical models for Trading Optimization System and Firm Transportation Optimization System.  The Trading Optimization System becomes the most popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy just signed the contract to buy this product yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department, the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15 companies in one or two years.  Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my research and system developing efforts to combine revenue management with risk management. I am confident that I can make significant contributions to Enron in this area.  I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to work in Enron.  Sincerely Yours   Jacob    --- Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com wrote: > Jacob, > > It was nice meeting you.

farmer-d	 Hey Guys and Girls, ? Here's an idea for an icebreaker activity for our  2nd week of NEON.? This is  only an idea, you can use it or do something  totally different.? Again, let  me know along the way if you have something  that has worked well for your  group so we can share in the wealth. ? Someone in your group should have a couple of  classic books full of  icebreaker-game type of activities, Building Community  in Youth Groups, and  Youth Group Trust Builders.? We all at  one time had a selection of  icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still  have somewhere in a  drawer.? Spend time in the games and forced  interactions, especially over  the beginning of the semester.? If you don't  have these resources, let me  know.? Even if some of these ideas may seem  familiar to you, remember that  you may have been doing this far longer than the  oldest kids have been in  your group.?But again, if you have any ideas for  resources let me know. ? In addition to the ideas to think about at the top  of the 2nd weeks topic, a  couple of additional thoughts given me by  leaders: ??? -Realize and possibly  communicate in a low key manner to the freshman  that their expectations of NEON  may not initially be met.? They may be  coming in with ideas of what NEON  is, only to possibly be disappointed.? In  a sense it is similar to going to  a restaurant or movie after tons of people  have recommended it to you, and being  a little let down.? More importantly,  they need to realize that NEON is not  an event, it is a process.? The teens  who say they love it are most often  the ones who have been in it long enough  to have built relationships and to have  shared a bunch of common  experiences.? With time and a commitment on their  part to be at NEON weekly,  their expectations will ultimately be  met. ??? -Remember that the best quality  time you have with the kids is probably  before or after NEON, or at other  non-NEON times. ? Have fun loving on your kids  Wednesday! ? Bobby  - NEON Opening Lesson.doc 
kaminski-v	 Samer's suggestion makes a lot of sense. We can start with something like one  floating dev. license + 2 OPL licenses and buy more later based on actual  usage. On the pricing agreement, it probably makes sense to get a guarantee  on the discounts  for additional licenses for one year (or till Dec.). I am  definitely interested and can provide the share of funding necessary from my  clients.   Thanks, Krishna.   From: Samer Takriti@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 05/19/2000 11:14 AM To: Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pinnamaneni  Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON, samer_takriti@enron.net, Stinson  Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON, Tom Halliburton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Vince J  Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: RE: CPLEX floating license    Chonawee and I just had a phone conversation with Cplex. There are other  alternatives (products) that may help in saving time and cost. Chonawee and I  feel that one floating develoment license, and one or two OPL (a package on  sale that provides modeling and optimization features) licenses will do. In  addition, we need floating deployment licenses. For the development licenses,  the charges should be split "equally" between the different groups that may  ask for optimization help (although it is hard to predict who may ask for  future help). We are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to  develop the needed solution but are not (in general) used to run the  software. The deployment licenses can be charged on per-use basis for  different groups. Cplex is going to send us a new quote. We'll make the decision soon after  that. -Samer

kaminski-v	 Vince,   If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the building.   If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

I have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some other faculty between 11:30 and 12:00, and then you would have some time to visit with Sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well between lunch and my class.       Sheridan and a guest speaker from his class, Suresh Sundaresan from Columbia, will be joining us for dinner.  I could provide transportation to your hotel, and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be the most convenient alternative.       I will have a PC available in the classroom, with Office 2000 and windows NT.  You could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine, if that's most convenient.  You could simply email the presentation, and I would have it for you if you prefer.       How much time would you like?  I would like to reserve about 30 minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real options, and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students (which is required for all classes).  At some point, we should take a brief break, so that would leave approximately 1.5 to 2 hours for your presentation if you would like that flexibility.  Otherwise, I could take up the "slack".       I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

beck-s	 Rick, Rick,  There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous  to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices. They are very  small. We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so  that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a  designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily. This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not  all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same. Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some  originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some  execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute  trades).   is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit. Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of  office Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved  We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time. Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.  It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for  the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch  that, as was evidenced by EOTT.  Are you both happy with this approach? Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?  Thanks, Richard 
kaminski-v	  Dear Mr. Kaminski,   I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.   I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.   Thank you for your time.   Sincerely   G.

Ags, What better statement can we Aggies make, than to celebrate the love  and support for our country's freedom, and our patriotic nature, than this  way:  Imagine...The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band playing "The Star Spangled Banner,"  playing military drills as they walk around the stadium, and we celebrate  our love for our country, and our support for all the heroes, alive and  deceased.  Color assignments are as follows:                  3rd deck: Red                  2nd deck: White                  1st deck: Blue  Pass the word on.... we have 1 1/2 weeks!!

kaminski-v	 Jason, After our brief discussion last night I think I should discuss a few of the  issues I have with respect to calculating a VaR on the deal that you are  proposing.  The VaR model, as I illustrated, is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions, prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the 'silver mine' position into these inputs.  I do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price. The VaR model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period.  To do this properly I would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in MTM  in the future and that is essentially what VaR is supposed to predict. If you need me to work on this then you need to contact Steve who will help  to prioritise my time. I will also need to consult with Vince Kaminski and  Tanya Tamarachenko in Houston for advice. RAC will also assist in the process. Please contact me if you have any further questions, Kirstee x34529

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Zimin and I talked briefly about the part-time work this morning. To recap; I am willing to work 20 hours a week, however, I expressed my concern about commuting every week. I asked if commuting once every two weeks (and work out of Austin every other week) would be acceptable. As to the term of the work, I suggested a 3-mo period (I have yet not talked to international office which arranges work authorization using Curricular Practical Training of which I have used up 9 months already), I might run into problems if I ask for more. I also mentioned that I would do my best to accomodate your preferences. We did not discuss any other details.  I shall be awaiting for your response on this matter.

I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don't know as of now.  I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a "panel" that is discussing equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should require little, if any, preparation time).

Numerical recipes does not contain  subroutines where equality and inequality contraints can be easily  incorporated.  Also, the number of arguments that can be handled is also  limited.  IMSL provides a comprehensive library of more than 300 C/C++  statistical and  mathematical analysis functions.  We think that it would be of great value to  our efforts and to the efforts of our research group.  Presently the cost is  aproximately around $1500 and Mike Bothwell (Visual Numerics Rep) assures us  as the version is not license protected, we all can use it as long as  simultaneous usage is within the license.  Please let me know if you should need further information.

Version 5 will be.  The PC Version 4.0 can be installed on a network drive and called from networked PCs.  As expected, we would ask that Enron honor the license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted by the license.  Version 5.0 will be license managed and can be licensed as node locked or floating.  With regard to Unix licensing, the current version of CNL for Unix is license managed.  It can be licensed as node locked or floating.  If you install the libraries on a Unix server as node locked, the number of simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the capabilities of the machine.  A floating Unix license would be checked out by the individual user to be executed on a local machine.  Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and desired platforms.  This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered under support.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to help you solve your problems and understand your data.

I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to  discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I  suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and  perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved  experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include  performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what  he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested  once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise  origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the  internship.    Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and  this is a great way to start.  I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start  around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.  Regards,  Ravi.  P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo  will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day  basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat  fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very  specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that  may be too low, etc.     ----- Forwarded by Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications on 02/17/00 09:27  AM -----

kaminski-v	 NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends 03/14/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends --------------------------------------------------------------- By Dave Kearns  NetWare has shipped with Btrieve (originally a flat-file database system, now grown into a full-fledged relational database system) since the days of NetWare 2 some 12 years ago. Many independent software vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.  Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software. Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of "Pervasive SQL 2000," a true relational database system which nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the Btrieve 6.x specification.  A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1 includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for the administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any Btrieve-based applications the network might be running.  There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators could be caught off-guard when applications stop working.  For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10 included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the real killer  most current applications (such as Computer Associates ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.  Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better choice.

farmer-d	  Desk Managers,   I will be issuing a small laminated version of the attached list of contacts for escalation of Unify and EDI issues in a small laminated version.  The objective in putting Richard first on the list is to address any issues that are business related or education related prior to getting IT folks involved; thereby, freeing up our IT folks to work on programming fixes and enhancements.    <<EscalationProcedures.xls>>   After implementation, if you feel these escalation procedures are not providing the level of support your desk requires, please let me know.   Regards,   Tammy  
kaminski-v	 Vince,  Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron  India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.   Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your  group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I  explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the  Henwood study.  DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There  maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues  that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to  Houston.  I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such  a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to  Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that  before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.  I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here  have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down  due to many lay-offs.  I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!  Regards, Sandeep.

kaminski-v	 Kim, I know you have been interested in the development of a long term  Natural Gas Model for use in the ETS Revenue Management effort.  I agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for North America  should prove useful in ETS business development efforts, and in particular,  in predicting the impact of the new, large Alaskan gas supplies on the N.A.  pipeline grid.  As you know, Vince Kaminski feels that a software product developed by Dale  Nesbitt (MarketPoint, Inc.) of Los Altos Hills, CA. may be a good choice, and  one readily available in a relatively short time.  MarketPoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing, so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software.  They have proposed a charge of $12,000, plus expenses, for the  one-week session, with that cost applied to the first year's subscription  price (approx. $55-60 M/yr) should we decide to go forward.  The other  details (timing, ENE resources required, necessary IT interface, etc) still  need to be worked out, but I believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test.    With my recent relocation to the Clean Fuels group, I will no longer be  responsible for the Alaskan pipeline development.  However, Danny McCarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from NNG, NBP and elsewhere in  ETS to push the project forward.  I believe Eric Gadd will be playing a key  role as well.  The decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team.     I have attached a draft of the proposed MarketPoint License agreement.  It  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal (or by Shelley C. for the  "affiliate" issues).    Let me know if I can provide any other background or assistance.  JNG           
kaminski-v	 Brad,  I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.  Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I= =20 think the system is doing:   Curve shift =3D today's price - yesterady's price  P/L due to curve shift =3D today's market value using today's price curve (= with=20 everything esle the same as yesterday's) - yesterday's market value using= =20 yesterday's price curve.  So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order=20 terms. We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri= ce=20 change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore= tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the = delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde= r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?= ????????

kaminski-v	 To Margaret and Beth,  In order to ensure a comprehensive speech to Goveror Johanns, I am in the  process of compiling some preliminary research on the Impacts of Energy  Prices on Agri-business in Nebraska.  Before I can make a decision of whether  I can accept this offer to speak, I would like to finish this preliminary  study.    I need to know the deadline of your request.  Can you give me a better  understanding as to the duration of the speech and the type of forum in which  I will be speaking?  Should I expect a Q&A after the speech?  Who will be in  the audience?  What companies and CEO's will be attending the meeting?    Who  will be speaking on energy derivatives?  Please let me know when you need my  decision.    Regards,  Maureen Raymond-Castaneda 
kaminski-v	 Bill and Mark, the figure below shows you what happens when we simulate forward prices using  current methodology of our Credit Reserve Model. The time scale on this figure goes from 0 to 30 years. I started with $5.2  gas prices at time 0 and used the NG forward volatility curve which has 50% volatilities in the front and 13.5% vols for long-term contracts. You  can see from the figure, that, for example, at 30 years horizon the price will be more than $13.4 with probability 5% but less than $22.1  with probability 99%. The corresponding lower bounds are $1.17 and $0.71.

beck-s	 Hi Sally,  Am assuming you got the OU stickers for your new vehicle and that David has already put them on by now.  I will be in Houston the end of this month (May 30- June 2) and would like to take you to lunch if possible and get caught up on everything.  I have also asked Mike McConnell to join us if possible. Hopefully the two of you have a free day available for lunch and can coordinate a time and day. Let me know if and when the two of you would be available and I will schedule around your plans.  I guess Michelle, Clay and Blake will have been there for a week when I am there.  I was sad to see George leave the recruiting side, as he really did a good job of promoting Enron to both OU and my students. I know he will do a great job at Enron OnLine.  Hope all is going well with your father and that you are not constantly traveling around the world and being away from your family.  Look forward to hopefully seeing you later this month.  Ted K.

ASSUMPTIONS  * Constant cashflows between the quoted years (as opposed to interpolating  swaps which distorts the curve a lot). This explains the atrocious look of  the "raw" curve. It is then smoothed with a macro, which Anjam wrote.  * Mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve;  * Discount rate is LIBOR and I solve for the coupon rate, which is the RPI  YOY rate;    * The above is solved separately for each quoted period (e.g. 2 yrs, 5 yrs)  and RPI rates are determined for the incremental portion.  By forecasting RPI in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the  forecasted levels.  Looking forward to your comments and seeing you in London!  Best regards,  Martina x34327 
farmer-d	 Robert and I put our heads together and decided to enter the partnership  agreement on the days in question to keep the third parties whole.    Thu - it will be reallocated in about five minutes.

You need to look at the entire Midtex  line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy,  I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts  from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the  Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you  may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL  Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex  line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy  is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the  swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party  contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to  cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.

Sorry about that and so glad you caught it. I multiplied by 1.5 and I meant to use 1.3.  We have discounted deployment paks which we discount by quantity.  Our chart starts with a 3 pak so I took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1.3 to get 14,560.00.  For 2 deployments, I take $4,500 for one, plus 10% off for the second license 4,050, then times 1.3 = 11,115.00.  Here is the revised quote.  I checked the other numbers again and they are correct.

kaminski-v	 Norma,  It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the  mistake by moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.  As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity  raises. The column totals are misleading.  I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments. I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).   Vince

Though the accounting consolidation date will be the end of the month, we  will effectively "own" the trading positions as of close of business  yesterday (if anyone wants clarification on the distinction between these two  dates please call). Therefore, as far as possible we need to have a  recognisable "middle office" in place to ensure transparency of trading  positions and results, efficient and controlled operational processes,  segregation of duties; in a nutshell, no accidents!  So, where are we...  1) Last Week ...  Valuation Review - Andy Cornfield and I completed a detailed review of  trading positions and associated valuations to ensure that from cob  yesterday, all positions were correctly valued in line with Enron's valuation  methodology.  SAP - Wayne Andrews (Project Apollo Director) was over from Houston to  kick-off the "MG migration to SAP" project. Michael Heap will be leading this  project from London with a focus on establishing a project plan over the next  few weeks.  Remote Offices -  MG have offices all over the world and it is important to  distinguish between "trading" offices, that are permitted to "commit" the  firm, and origination and representative offices that service the "trading"  offices. Enron staff have been visiting all of MG's offices over the past few  weeks so we can ensure that appropriate controls are established around the  different types of office.   2) This Week  DPR -  yesterday Sheila Foo produced a DPR for the entire MG operation,  sub-divided into five distinct business units for onward reporting to Enron  and MG senior management. Mary Thambiah will be consolidating the results  with those of Enron Europe from cob today - the first day we "own" MG's  trading results.  Doorstep and Process Review - a "Doorstep" controls review was performed by  Brent Price two weeks ago, and provisional findings noted. However, a deal  test is still outstanding and we are inviting AA back to this week to  complete it. We are also asking AA to document work flow and systems  processes so we have a better understanding of the integration points as we  move the MG business on to the Enron Middle Office model.  3) Lastly, attention model train enthusiasts...  MG have about eight meters of LGB standard gauge track, a couple of  locomotives and an array of rolling stock - problem is that the network fell  over a couple of weeks ago (I blame it on Gerald Corbett!). Are there any  model train enthusiasts out there prepared to give up some of there time to  fix it? Any offers for help will be accepted on a confidential basis -  anonymity assured!!  Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions on any of the above x  34264.  Regards, Tim

farmer-d	 Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows:  
beck-s	 Sorry to hear about this one.   I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the  account:  1 It looks like the old "undue influence" problem again. It seems some  attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened.   We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't  have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if  they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that  is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows  some of these attributes.  For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to  be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of  the operations staff.   2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm  the basis on which they signed it.  3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in  the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage  is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.  4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same  day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to  know why it took them so long.  5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a  highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in  addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct  we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.  I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

Fernley    James New 09/06/2000 10:03 To: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike  Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Robert Yeo/LON/ECT@ECT, Gail Hill/LON/ECT@ECT, Ian Sloman/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit   On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had  been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked  significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m).  The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the  30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for  periods in 2003-2004.  Background  1) Input errors  For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal  input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most  significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been  found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness  of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the  only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation  system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support  of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).  In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted  booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of  all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May  which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been  discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.  2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)  Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the  deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are  the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.  Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day  and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by  documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers  were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).  3) New Deal sign off  As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is  signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and  the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the  new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.  4) Documentation convention  In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation.  (relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after  trade booking.  5) Brokerage invoices  Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then  reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the  deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to  authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with  documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.   Specific details of these 'late' trades  1) Summary  For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be  established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary  control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals.   As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from  either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.  The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements  in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for  payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage  invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched  together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th  of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between  passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims  that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed  follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the  22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position  which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.  Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals  being booked on the 6th of June.  2) Deal specifics  EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000 Trader Marcello EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson) Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May  as requested by documentation to prove deal. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.   IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000 Trader Haakon IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn) Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.     Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?  I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but  there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that  can be made and drawn.  Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and  prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the  subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage  where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the  error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis  every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time  trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to  avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% -  15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out  of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.  Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to  provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will  eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately  obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now  changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's  of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.  Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow  up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis.  There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by  settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is  causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.  Action Points  Trading  Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk  Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking  Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis  Trade Support  Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices  Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual  deal statements  All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate  Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the  broker records  Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree  our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the  curve)

kaminski-v	 Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson about who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.  Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The "Details of Jan and July.xls" workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply curve becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.  The workbook "Supply Curve.xls" has the simplistic, average supply curve I mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.  The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:  Tao Guo, PhD, Senior "Algorithmist"  (916-569-0985) * the one I was thinking of Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985) Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) * more a trainer, but sharp Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 * very resourceful Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) * best for questions about EMSS per se  all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com  Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP (916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.  Regards, Michael       >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>>  Michael,   I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems.   I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though, marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:   For each hour, for each generating station:   "marginal cost" [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] - VOM_cost [o/MWh]   This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.   Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?   It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.   Regards   Karolina 
kaminski-v	 Dear All,  I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office  during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be  available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading  and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go  through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation,  probably on Monday.  TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarne's team to help  us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in  trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves  and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity  desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly  forward volatility curve have been developed.  ORIGINATION: Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts)  etc. perhaps with Didrik.  ENERGYDESK.COM To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com  systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the  discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for  this I hope to meet with Trond).  EXOTIC OPTIONS: If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which  should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.  I will be in the Oslo office from Friday afternoon, and available all day  Monday and Tuesday.  I will be staying at the Grand Hotel and probably  contactable on my mobile: 07747 86813.  Look forward to meeting you soon!  Regards,  Anjam x35383  P.S. I will be contactable on my mobile for any urgent queries from London  customers: 07747 868131, or reachable through Catherine/Maret (x2570)

farmer-d	        Mike:      I have terminated about 12 to 13 inactive inter pipe/internal pools effective 12/01/01.  There are several  other inactive pools which I did not eliminate because      they had balances in it.     I also spoke to Jim Tobacco at EPGT for at least an hour or so, going over every line item which was rejected, please get with me once you are back in the office     and I will go over the "correct" pathing procedures.     I met with Richard and reviewed November transactions for EPGT to determine if we could eliminate the External Pools but unfortunately we cannot do this.     If we transport then we must use the External Pool.  However, you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently     using, therefore, I have terminated the internal pools.     Please review the changes and let me know if  this will work for you..     I will be in touch with you after I meet with El Paso.        
farmer-d	 As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was  scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be  provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future.  I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first  meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we  know are needed in our work hours.   Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting:  Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other  contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss  at the next meeting.  Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for  their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting  Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow  up with HR on schedules being used at Enron    The following is what I heard at the first meeting:  Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that  would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have  the weekend off.  Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed  to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels.  Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "just do it"  attitude.   There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However  all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will  be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk  changes.  Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders  willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other  companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address  this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and  really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job.  There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some  type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open  to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule.    Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm  looking forward to our next meeting - Bob

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried "Wolf!" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators "gaming the system" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that "generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market" =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say "apparently" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls "megawatt laundering" =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to "imports" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: "I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan "a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout" from the looming disaster.

beck-s	 Sally  Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch.   I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes  we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to  the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming  together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have  to look at it piece by piece.   We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for Enron  Australia Energy and Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the  dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good  opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations.   As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing  all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are  now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in  Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be  the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi  Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the  Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns).   The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and  will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow  independent audit review to occur as required.   In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised  signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week.  In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in  Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key  individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed  briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations  would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed  happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented  a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to  her?  Thanks  Heidi

However, for October 2000, the plant was down the  majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing  money to Tenaska IV.  I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the  calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached  schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay  this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do  this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in  the future.  Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.  Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.   Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we  reimburse Tenaska IV.

As discussed, I need weighted  temperature data for east, west and production areas.   I would appreciate if you could  provide that data.  After that, I could add forward price curve as explainatory variables.   Since AGA is a market mover, it is important to have an accurate model.

Paulo told me  that you are interested in some information of us before going to Houston.  Well, I am form Chile, married, and father of two girls (3 and 2). I  graduated from the Engineering School at the Catholic University of Chile in  1995 having followed the track in Computer Science during the last 3 years of  school. Then, late in 1995, I was hired by the Industrial Engineering  department as a full-time Assistant Professor of Management Science, where I  was teaching and doing research until June 1997. In August 1997 I came to  Boston to join the Operations Management group in the Sloan School of  Management here at MIT. I already finished courses and qualifiers  requirements of my program, so now I am trying to come up with an interesting  research topic to develop my Ph.D. thesis.  I have been dealing with some interesting topics during the last months but  since Enron appears as an opportunity to find a more challenging and  appealing problem to me I decided to explore it. My intention in going to  visit Enron is to have a better understanding of the bandwidth business in  order to define a problem to work with. I would really like to do a thesis  that involves Internet issues and yield management models, in the line of  Amit's work.  Any other information or question you need, please feel free to contact me.  Looking forward to meeting you on the 16th.  Juan Carlos Ferrer   ?? -------------------------------------- ?????????

beck-s	 After all of the chaos and discontent over the AEP / HPL situation, I thought I would convey some first hand comment in regard to Bob Hall.  Every person that has spoken to me about the AEP / HPL situation, has had nothing but praise for the fair and compassionate way that Bob has dealt with some very difficult situations.  Through my personal observations, I know that he has also done a great job of keeping the ultimate goal of a June closing on track, in the face of  huge obstacles.  Since this is PRC time, I thought I would share this with you.  If you have any questions or would like some more particulars, please feel to give me a call at x36674 or shoot me an email. 
kaminski-v	 George-  Here is one statistical method (linear regression), applied to Hosanna's fund  giving. The method is deterministic, where contributions each Sunday are  attempted to be explained by significant events on the church's and members'  calendars, and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal  one, where each Sunday's giving might be estimated to be the average giving  of the same Sunday (e.g., each 2nd Sunday in January) in the past.  The following effects are estimated independently by the computer (they add  and subtract with each other accordingly; some Sundays can have more than one  effect "in play"):  1) most positive for giving: an additional +$8,802 for special pastoral  appeals (3 of them in the past 3 years)  2) positive for giving: an additional +$2,551 Easter and nearest- Christmas  "Sunday," an additional +$59 Thanksgiving Sunday, and a tiny additional +$1  each week pure time trend.  3) negative for giving: -$304 for Sundays of Monday Federal Holiday weekends,  and -$9 during the Summer (June 1-Aug 31)  4) "wave": there  is an $80 per week "wave"- giving $80 higher one week, $80  lower the next, etc ...  The computer can explain roughly 60% of the absolute variation in giving the  past 3 years using this approach. Keep in mind, much of the information,  statistically, is captured in the pastoral appeals, Easter and Christmas  Sundays, and Holiday weekends. The rest of the variation cannot be explained  by this simple model (i.e., it looks like "noise").  Here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year. You can  cut-and-paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet  you like. They may  seem "boring" to you; please remember they are the deterministic components  of a process that involves a lot of volatility, and your church's actual  experience will predictably be volatile. These numbers are as-if the "means"  of  experiences dependent on the "standard deviations."  01/02/00 4611 01/09/00 4699 01/16/00 4394 01/23/00 4705 01/30/00 4701 02/06/00 4702 02/13/00 4703 02/20/00 4400 02/27/00 4710 03/05/00 4706 03/12/00 4708 03/19/00 4709 03/26/00 4710 04/02/00 4711 04/09/00 4712 04/16/00 4713 04/23/00 7265 04/30/00 4672 05/07/00 4717 05/14/00 4718 05/21/00 4719 05/28/00 4416 06/04/00 4717 06/11/00 4713 06/18/00 4714 06/25/00 4715 07/02/00 4716 07/09/00 4718 07/16/00 4719 07/23/00 4720 07/30/00 4721 08/06/00 4722 08/13/00 4723 08/20/00 4724 08/27/00 4725 09/03/00 4432 09/10/00 4742 09/17/00 4738 09/24/00 4739 10/01/00 4740 10/08/00 4742 10/15/00 4743 10/22/00 4744 10/29/00 4745 11/05/00 4746 11/12/00 4747 11/19/00 4748 11/26/00 4808 12/03/00 4750 12/10/00 4752 12/17/00 4753 12/24/00 7305 12/31/00 4711  Best wishes,  Clayton Vernon Manager, Research

kaminski-v	 THIS NOTE IS FROM TED MURPHY (not bjorn hagelman)  My understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the  intent of diverting resources from the GRMS project to some other project.  While I am not privy to the urgency of this other project, I do know that we  have a very large, multi -phase project going in GRMS. GRMS stands for the GLOBAL RISK MONITORING SYSTEM.  It is not intended to be  a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial  decision-making.  Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary  purpose of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems  and their inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.    RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task  list to accomplish its objectives.  As a firm we are woefully behind our  press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.   My most recent sojorn  in Europe is a classic example of the current systems  inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision  making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that  of the Market Risk Group in RAC.    The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to  do our jobs.  We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter  to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with  Jonathon and his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.  While progress  is never as fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only  to rely on RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been  hit.  The primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of  resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other  source - most recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to  deadlines.    Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note,  but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.   Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration  on the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting  itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.  I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase  project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.  Please let us  do our jobs.  I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that  they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our  consideration of their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own  project with their own resources.  Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.  As it relates to things  that will effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me  as I would you.  Ted 
farmer-d	 BammelYoungFamilies  --------------------------- ListBot Sponsor -------------------------- Start Your Own FREE Email List at http://www.listbot.com/links/joinlb ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a statement that was read over the PA system at the football game at Roane County High School, Kingston, Tennessee by school Principal Jody McLoud, on September 1, 2000. I thought it was worth sharing with the world, and hope you will forward it to all your friends. It clearly shows just how far this country has gone in the wrong  direction.  "It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games to say a prayer and play the National Anthem to honor God and Country.  Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a prayer is a violation of Federal Case Law.  As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle, and if someone is offended, that's OK.  I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe  sex. If someone is offended, that's OK.  I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a viable means of birth control. If someone is offended, no problem.  I can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to  religiously worship and praise the goddess, mother earth, and call it ecology.  I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong, traditional Christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment.  However, if anyone uses this facility to honor God and ask Him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship, Federal Case Law is violated.  This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical. Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except God and His Commandments.  Nevertheless, as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression.  For this reason, I shall, "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," and refrain from  praying at this time. However, if you feel inspired to honor, praise and thank God, and ask Him in the name of Jesus to bless this event, please feel free to do so. As far as I know, that's not against the law- yet."  AND...one by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands with one another, and began to pray. They prayed in the stands. They prayed in the team huddles. They prayed at the concession stand. And they prayed in the announcer's box. The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme Court of the United States of America - the seat of "justice" in the one nation under God.  Somehow, Kingston, Tennessee, remembered what so many have forgotten... we are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM Religion.  Praise God that His remnant remains!  Let's Celebrate Jesus in 2001  Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father."  ---------  If you are not ashamed, Pass this on . . . but only if you mean it.  Yes, I do Love God. He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without him, I am nothing but with Him, I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. Phil 4:13  Geoff Gayle Synergy Oil & Gas, Inc.

farmer-d	 Steve/Daren,  I interviewed this candidate and REALLY liked her.  She has previous  allocations and settlements experience, but really wants to do financial  accounting.  As you will see on her resume, she is doing internal auditing at  Foleys.  She was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do  allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and  traders, although she doesn't necessarily want to schedule or trade.  She  mentioned Risk specifically.  I think she would be an asset to Enron.  Please  use at your discretion.

beck-s	 Joel has been negotiating with Open Text along with Ryan Orsak - as Enron has  been providing numerous resource hours testing their 'beta' product that  integrates Livelink with IRIMs for records management processes.

Therefore, Joel sought a credit  to reimburse Enron for the value of the testing we have performed for them.

kaminski-v	 In case you haven't already seen this:  El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )  HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG) reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve California's energy situation. "We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Paso's involvement in California," said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. "We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record."  The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a "conspiracy" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999, reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California "energy crisis" was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the state's economy and increased demand. A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers, leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers, the utilities' creditworthiness was impaired, causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term power market.  "California is currently in a difficult position, but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term energy policy," said Dunn. "El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term, stable solution to California's energy needs."  El Paso Corporation, the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing, most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nation's third largest natural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is focused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and speeding the development of new markets.

kaminski-v	 As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about trading operations from two very respected individuals in the industry. Keith Anderson of BlackRock, Inc (JGSM 1983) and Dexter Senft of Lehman Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to attend, and James Weston recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking Investments next year to be there.  When: 9:45 a.m. - 11:15 a.m. Wednesday April 18  Where: Room 117 Herring Hall  Presentation/Discussion Topics: Trading Tactics - phone trades vs. electronic trading Evolution of e-trading in fixed income markets The future of the trading desk Buy-side vs. Sell-side issues  Speaker Profiles:  Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income of BlackRock, Inc., is co-head of the Fixed Income Operating Committee, Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock's Management Committee.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which meets quarterly in Washington, D.C. with the Secretary and Staff of the U.S. Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt.  Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.8 billion fixed income portfolio.  Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies, including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: "Scenario Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management" and "Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income Market".     Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman's Fixed Income Research, Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments.  Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10 billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He remains on TradeWeb's Board, and chairs TradeWeb's trading protocol committee, which oversees the rules that govern the electronic flow of information within the system.  Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association's Committee for Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee and he chairs the subcommittee on e-commerce protocols and standards.  Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now part of CS First Boston), where he was a Managing Director and head of Fixed Income Research and Product Development. He is a widely published author of articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative portfolio management, and his work continues to be among the readings for CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the first CMO for Freddie Mac.   This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get the info out to more 2nd years as well.  Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty, students, and staff?  Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance elective to come.  These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.  Thanks.  bbo 
beck-s	 Wes, As we discussed on Friday, I think that there is merit to your arguments  regarding the release in prudency in North America.  However, this may alter  the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and  ratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and  income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North  America at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true,  typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more  liquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect  liquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit  considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an "orderly  liquidation" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon  VAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last  month.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l  as opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that  I think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC  and Treasury once you have finalized a course of action. Ted

EnPower Structure Modification Paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the Legal  Entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your  Risk and Confirmation groups.  I have discussed this problem with Zhiyong Wei  (Houston's EnPower support) in order to inform him of the situation and Paul  mentioned that he has also spoken with Brian Hudson.  Transmission As of my last communication with Houston IT, the testing was almost  complete.  At the departure meeting mentioned above, we considered valuation  of transmission as a spread-option to be Plan A and further agreed upon a  Plan B and C.  The report details the operational risk involved in valuing  transmission by using the Forwards deal type in EnPower.  Since I have communicated with James and Mike and now with the 3 of you, I  have completed my responsibilities on this project.  We have now formalized a  direction with backup plans and I would encourage testing by the London  office to ensure that what meets the West Power desk's needs will also  address yours. If you need to further discuss this report, feel free to call  or set up a meeting.    Regards,   Todd Hall

These charges are based upon a  budgeted amount of allocating three resources to the GPG group (two resources  for Revenue Management and one resource for GPG Marketing).  We have utilized  the R&D group some during the first half of the year, but not to the full  extent of three resources.  Vince and Krishna have agreed to reverse out some  of the charges that were budgeted January through June.  We will revisit this  issue again toward the end of the year to determine if any adjustments are  necessary for July through December.     The budgeted amount January through June has been distributed between the NNG  and TW as follows:             Research and Development     BUDGET ($000)             NNG TW ET&S    January   $46.7  $  46.7   February   $26.1 $20.4 $  46.5   March    $35.9 $10.2 $  46.1   April    $34.8 $10.2 $  45.0   May     $36.4      $  8.8 $  45.2   June     $36.4 $  8.8 $  45.2         $274.7     Out of the $274.7 budgeted for the first half of the year, $199.7 is to be  reversed back to the Research and Development Department.  This reversal will  occur in July.  Vince, Vera Apodaca (ext.  X35980) will be our contact to  help facilitate the reversal of these charges.    Elaine, the remaining $75.0 ($274.7-$199.7) is to be allocated with $50.0  going to the Revenue Management Work Order and  $25.0 remaining in O&M.  If anyone has any questions or needs additional information, please don't  hesitate to call me (X33098).  Thanks, Kim.

kaminski-v	 Vince/Stinson:  The following is an update on LJM deal:  1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and our  Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which  we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for  the puts we own.  2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the  deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal. 3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts  value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That  line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From  my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit  reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.      4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor  MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is  actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody  mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model. 5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of  unwinding our position.   These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.  Paulo Issler

I appreciate your willingness to devote part of  your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.    As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business  will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in  working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan  for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this  process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the  office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as  usual.    I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to  work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to  all that we will accomplish in 2000.

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince,  It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!  I've asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some energy companies. It's mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a course?  We are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can you please let Julie know how you and Grant would like to be advertised - your official positions, etc.  Best regards, and I look forward to reading your chapter soon.

kaminski-v	 Allan,  Paulo Issler in our group, working with Eric Moon in structuring, recently  tracked down the reason for a slight mis-match in option pricing in ERMS vs.  the structuring spreadsheets.  It is due to the fact that the option  valuation functions in ERMS use a slightly less accurate approximation for  the cumulative normal distribution.  We would be happy to work with the right  person to update the ERMS code in order to close this discrepancy.   Please  let me know how you would like to proceed.  If you are not the correct person to address the mainenance of ERMS, please  let me know who to contact.  Thank you,  Stinson Gibner x34748 
kaminski-v	 Anjam,  Here is the model for fitting the term structure of UK gilts. The basic idea is as follows:  dirty price_{ith gilt} = Sum_{j} C_{i}/2*discount factor(t_{j,i} )+  100*discount factor(t_{Ni, i}  Using a five parameters analytical form for the discount factors, and  minimizing the sum of absolute errors, I can derive a smooth zero curve.   The model needs an  initial guess for the parameters, this may require some experience. The log file can help  you to see how well the optimization works.  Let me know if you have any questions.

kaminski-v	 Jason,  I think what you may be asking for are CalISO power prices.  The CalPX is a scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to the CalISO.  The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices.  The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the CalISO web site.  I am copying your mail to Tim Hiezenrader, who runs the Westdesk Fundamentals group.  I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more real-time CalISO data that Enron collects.

beck-s	 Sorry I am so late in replying!  It would seem that the MTM issue is  Bridgeline's decision and would solely be based on whether or not they are,  in fact, trading as defined in EITF 98-10.  There are about 4 pages of  criteria set forth in that document.  That may be a question you want to ask  Trevor Mihalik, but I do know that initially they did not meet 98-10  criteria.  Their business may well have changed by now.   I am confused by your suggestion about whether or not to involve commercial.   I may not understand, but we do already have a means to track our 40 %.  We  can certainly mark 60% of any business we do with Bridgeline, but the other  40% should be treated as affiliate business.

If so, what criteria must  Bridgeline meet and what is the expected timeline on it?

farmer-d	 I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Knig  Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I  forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of  contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is  negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we  will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a  gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.   HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not be  future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned  from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything will  be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different  counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts  and different counterparties.  Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss  the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion  also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper  scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we  be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling,  transport rates and risk are affected.  Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.

beck-s	 After last weeks volatility in the natural gas market, I think we all agreed  it is imperative that the trading, risk controls, and reporting groups  understand how eack group looks at risk, and how we manage the process.   While our processes are generally good, in times of extreme price and/or  volatility environments, we all could be more coordinated.  It is apparent  now that we must get together to look at all aspects of IT resources and  intraday price risk and VAR management since it seems these are not now, but  should be the same thing.

I am  pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal  Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos  who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead  position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group,  continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook  also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the  next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.   Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the  Texas team as he moves to the East Region.

Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members  who will continue in the group.  Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which  includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory  Reporting.

kaminski-v	 Steve,  I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather negative: he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth and technical details.  He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive side.  Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after 18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince,  This resume looks quite good.  We may wish to talk to him on the phone.  However, now that David Hoog has hired his own actuarial guys (Alex Tartakowski and Larry Markus) from Ace, I am not sure if they require support on the actuarial side.  With Don Black (of Global Risk Markets) leaving Enron, I think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets is pretty much nonexistent, except for David Hoog's product.  The resume still looks interesting, though.  Vasant   -----Original Message----- From:

This gas is presently being produced into Dow  Pipeline.  An existing, three-inch meter tube is in place, and the gas can be  switched by opening and closing existing valves?  A copy of a recent gas  analysis has been provided.  The expected gas flow is 9000 to 10,000 MCF/D.   Mr. Matt Johnson with Wagner & Brown has this gas committed on a month to  month basis into Dow.  Start-up of April 1 is anticipated.  Mr. Johnson is  expecting lower pipeline pressures; hence, enhanced production.  I would  attempt to obtain at least a year's commitment of this gas from Wagner &  Brown.  Mr. Johnson did not want to flow this gas for March since the  three-inch run could not handle the total volume, and he did not want to  split the flow.  Operational logistics were also questionable (compression,  etc.).  If you need further info, please advise.  Thanks.  JAB

kaminski-v	 Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much. I wonder if you could point me to some information resource on Enron's bandwidth market.  I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ architecture which is the latest proposal made by IETF to provide scalable service differentiation. I would very much like to get in touch with people in Enron working on the similar topics.  Thank you very much.  Jun Shu http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~jshu 
farmer-d	 Nick,  I understand that they terminated their agreement.  However, I don't feel  that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for the  gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter.   Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I  would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call  them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to  explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was  shut-in.    Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.  Mary

kaminski-v	 Dear Vince & Grant,  Thanks very much for the offer to go to Houston as a Manager to work with  Tanya Tamarchenko on VAR and credit risk within the Houston Research Group,  as we discussed on the phone yesterday.  I felt that it would be useful to  bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this  morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in  Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine  from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an  urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has  kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of  the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I  expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign  assignment representative in the near future.  I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to  make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make  the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working  with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in  terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.   The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron  Corp is too dramatic and requires me to "burn bridges" and my return to Enron  Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support  structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs  (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely  reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they  justify making the contract a three year (local) one.  I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &  value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have  identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an  "Excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also  "Excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my  existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off  allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).  Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,  Anjam x35383

kaminski-v	 Christie,  Thanks for helping out.  Attached is a one page "intro" to the project that Vince and I are undertaking.  Please let me know how you would like it "transformed" before passing it along to the leadership at Enron.  You have the basic story--Enron's leadership purposefully and very successfully transformed the company.  We plan to document in broad strokes the "plan" as it was set out, and trace its evolution through the history of Enron's history.  The final result will be a 20-40 page paper written in the style of a Harvard Business Review piece.  Please let me know what else you may need.  I'll put it together for you.

kaminski-v	 Eric,  I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge. I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it.   When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was  ready  and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.  I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.  I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

kaminski-v	 Jaesoo, as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please, implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves the following:  1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want to use and which Enron's curves belong to each region. 2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each region. This decision can  be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might be other considerations. 3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve.  Winston, can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo with clustering done by SAS? Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this?   Tanya.

In the Indian system, the Governor represents the  Federal government in the state.  Hence any information he gathers is for the  Central Govt.  This informal note is to be passed to him.

kaminski-v	 1. Legislation Passes- Short-Term Measures, Very Long-Term Measures  As we said yesterday, SB-7X passed the California State Senate easily.  The  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  Department of Water and Resources until February 2nd.  The Department will  have $400 million available to finance power purchases, but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $1 billion by next week.  AB-1X has evolved into a longer-term solution and in its current form, would  authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into long-term  contracts (as opposed to the 15 day contracts in SB-7X) to buy power at a  price cap of 5.5 cents per kw/h.  This legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by SB-7X, when negotiations between generators, the utilities,  and the state are likely to resume.  A second piece of legislation under --SB 6X--has created uncertainty in the  markets.  This legislation will create a California Public Power Authority  with bond issuance authority.  The uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities.  The current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency. Yet the legislation also says "the authority may issue bonds,  exercise power of eminent domain, and enter into joint power agreements and  buy, own, and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project."  The general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts, or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch.11 proceeding.   2. Default Update  3. Bush  As we reported on Wednesday, the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved

farmer-d	 Darren: Here is my problem.  As you know, HPLC did a deal with Texas General Land O= ffice where we would exchange gas for crude.  The problem was HPLC was sell= ing the gas and Enron Gas Marketing was receiving the crude.  Bryce Baxter = worked out a series of intercompany deals between HPLC, ENA and EGM that wo= uld book the deal correctly.  Julie Meyers was told how to create the deals=  and she completed January and February, except for one small part, but Mar= ch forward was never completed.  The attached word document explains the pr= ocedure.  Basically, we were suppose to book an HPLC sale to the TGLO with = volume and zero price.  This would book the volume to the GL and zero out t= he receivable since we were never going to receive cash from TGLO.  Then, w= e would book a sale from HPLC-Wellhead to ENA-Wellhead for the value of the=  gas only (no volume) and a sale from ENA-Wellhead to EGM for the value of = the crude (no volume).  For these deals, we would use demand fees. EGM will=  pay ENA for the crude dollars.    =20  I will give you the deals for January so you can see how the dollars move. =  You will see that the price is still on the sale from HPLC to TGLO.

I  would want to review the scope of the  content and look at the frequency.?  Just like print  publications,?email newsletters are?now the rage and too  many  are?landing in the email inboxes.??My counsel would be to start  with a  manageable number and do it well.?You can always increase  frequency.?  Difficult to cut back on frequency without it appearing as a  take away or  lack of commitment to the product. Staffing??  ? *Invite outside industry analysts or  clients to provide commentary. ? *Consider developing an "editorial advisory  board" to govern the  content.??Traders,?legal  department, communications dept. A  multidisciplinary group that?can add  value to the publication. ? *Suggest finding an IMS or IT resource from  within Enron to be assigned to  this communications  effort.??Database set up for the email addresses,  technical  issues arise?for?creating the links etc.? Managing an   e-newsletter in my current position, I can?tell you that a writer/editor  has  enough to do to compile content.??You want mailings to go off  without any  glitches.?

Legal Documentation - Why contract volumes were significantly exceeded and no  documentation prepared to support trades once the 330k mtpy annual limit was  breached?  The effect apparently was trades being done without contractual  support.  Deliverables Accelerate Feb month end payments (approx. 30 MM). Disallow deferred payments from Muentes (up to 75 days in some instances) if  customers are paying more quickly.  Current contract, now effectively  expired, allows deferral of payments (1/3 each month starting with end of  month of discharge). Assign future A/R's directly from third parties on the other side of Muentes. Create a lock box for future payments to avoid receiving $'s via Muentes. Execute JV documentation that has now been outstanding for some time.  Goals - in sequential order:  reduce exposure to Muentes, paper  non-documented transactions already done (ie. beyond volume limits of current  contract, review mid/back office systems to avoid future problems, improve  structure via JV or other interim steps if JV execution is still some time  off.  D Weekes - Get with Ross Koller to make sure no new business is done with  Muentes (beyond fulfilling new commitments).  Likewise, you or Hardy need to  get with Tim P-P and R Quick in order to assure all are on the same page and  agree the best way forward for this relationship.  Based on info. in hand,  there does not appear to be an issue with Muentes' ability to perform (please  confirm).  Therefore, care should be taken to maintain the relationship;  however, I don't see the benefit in doing new deals with Muentes (beyond  fulfilling current commitments) until the exposure is brought down.  Muentes  does not appear to justify additional exposure based on my conversation with  Hardy last week.  So, before the credit limit is reconsidered, the structure  needs to be improved where payments bypass Muentes (via lockbox or another  alternative) and A/R's assigned directly to ENE.  The new JV documents may  take steps to improve the structure; however, this needs to be confirmed as  it has been some time since the JV docs. have been circulated.    SY         
kaminski-v	 Mike,  Here is third version of the program. It gives better results than the  previous versions you have. Sorry for the delay, these past 2 days I have  been busy meeting with people on the new EBS project. I think the result  looks reasonably good. You can try it.

kaminski-v	 Vince and Jeff...the following is "FYI"...my assistant is working on the  flight arrangements.  Also, "FYI", the DoubleTree and other downtown hotels   were entirely, or mostly, sold out, but my assistant found a good rate at the  Warwick [$115] by Herman Park, where everyone will be 'housed' in the same  location for one night--I also think this location is a good 'Houston-sell'.  Dinner is scheduled for 7 Thursday evening at Churrasco's , and my group is  arranging the "TourEnron"--breaking this group into 2.  [FYI: the Energy Club  from SMU (another Skilling Alma mater) had long ago also schedule a tour that  day, so we'll have 19 from SMU and 18 from Wharton on the same day...but so  far, all seems manageable.]  As "Tour times" are set, and business unit interview requests are received  from the students, I'll keep you posted.

I have three  years of market-making experience in illiquid  markets, which I beleive is  highly relevant. But it seems now that getting out  of my contract is not an  alternative anymore.? I learned yesterday that my  firm finally decided to  grant me what I wanted... a new desk. Sometimes I feel  that when you become  a trader you come to trade everything, including your  career. ? ?I thank you for your time and  consideration. ? Pierre ? ?

I review the quantitative issues  arising from Enron Europe models. I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London)  and also due to my past experience as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.  My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern,  ...), as well as the  review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their  respective volatility curves. Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market,  its respective price curve and term structure of volatility.  Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to  meet you and your team to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.   I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could  book some time for me in your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.  Thanks,  Rodrigo           
farmer-d	 Subject: Rankings for Source/Destination Please forward to logistics in your region......  Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the  Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source  rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the  Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source  side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry  errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave  Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to  find out if it would be something worth putting into production. Thanks. 
beck-s	 Sally  Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues  with the MO control process  Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -  The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for  edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness  for him as a control/supervisory report  The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly  around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking  solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such  that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our  perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no  specifics on errors have been provided ) The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior  and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a  role for him to focus on these detailed issues  In mitigation  The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to  the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to  Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of  daily p&l Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top  priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the  prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is  felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower (  also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation ) The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth  it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires  'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) -  continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff  being asked to join Commercial groups We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS  - resourcing is James and my top priority  I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :  upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead  individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including  the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process, focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that  eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage  expectations a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture  for MO will benefit/change his business support  However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with  experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power  settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been  struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago  and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for  Enlighten/DTL/EnVoice/Autoconfirms/DCAF - hence his frustration about lost  business opportunities NOW!!  Hence I would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be Neil  Tarling's replacement ) or could assist us in providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other  adjustments - so improving perception of C.P. DPR prioritising and influencing Enpower development agenda ( along with others ) project manage issues around 'unstable' documentation and settlement process  vis a vis client sensitivity provide leadership in changing expectations/perceptions  I'm sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a  'best fit' person   Please call if any of the above is unclear.

Vince Kaminski Enron      Marc Epstein <epstein@rice.edu> (by way of Kathy Spradling <spradlin on  01/22/2001 03:41:13 PM To: (Recipient list suppressed) cc:   Subject: Liz Demers research seminar   Dear faculty  Bob Westbrook and the accounting group has asked me to put together a continuing series of research workshops in accounting. My intention is to invite four or five researchers from around the country to present workshops on topics of interest each year. These are in addition to the normal recruiting seminars that we will have. The researchers will be a combination of senior and junior researchers. In addition to adding to our own research culture, the seminars should help promote the Jones School in the academic accounting community.  My intention is to invite people that are doing very interesting work that will be of interest to a large portion of the faculty. Given the small size of the accounting group, success of the seminars is dependent in part on the participation of faculty from other disciplines.  Our first seminar will be on February 16  from 10:30-12:00 and will be conducted by Elizabeth Demers, a Stanford PhD and presently an assistant professor at Rochester.  Her paper is titled " A Rude Awakening: Internet Shakeout in 2000" and co-authored with Baruch Lev ( a senior accounting researcher at NYU).  The work should be of particular interest to faculty in Finance and those interested in the valuation of internet companies and the value of intellectual capital and non financial information. I expect that it will be a very interesting seminar. Liz will arrive Thursday late afternoon and be here all day on Friday.

farmer-d	 Daren:  On 9/15/99, the above meter recorded flow of 2,476 Mmbtus.  There was Deal  #113050 at the meter for 9/14/99 , but it expired on 9/14/99.  Logistics  needs either (1) Deal #113050 extended to cover 9/15/99;  (2) a new deal to  record these volumes; or (3) Logistics needs approval to writeoff these  volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to  Clem Cernosek).     ____________________________________________  Deal/Deal Ticket #/Customer (Seller/Buyer)      OR    ________________________________________________________________   APPROVAL to Writeoff the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss  Thanks, Clem

My tentative meeting with Joe Gold for this afternoon has been rescheduled  for 9:00 this morning.  Attached is my assessment of the Continental Power  operations which I intend to discuss with him.  The first page is for Joe in  case he would like to keep notes from our discussion and the second page is  more detailed for myself.  Joe asked that he and I meet privately to discuss  the operations.  I've tried to be candid, but yet politically correct.  Today I am having lunch with Fernly and meeting with the Weather Commercial  team at 4:00.  I'll phone to give you an update, Todd    
farmer-d	 Sitara 147092 is tiered pricing. If you want, you can nom whatever volume is  on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly. It will keep  things in balance a bit better, but you can go either way. For Feb there is a  base deal for 5000/day and a term deal for 20,000/day. Only 15,000 of the  20000 is pathed.

How is Wednesday at 2:30?  I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman, Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk about a shotgun marriage!  If we have time next week, I could step you through our website -- www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).  Have a great weekend.

Prior  to joining Deutsche Bank, Dmitry worked for six  years with Global Analytics  Group of Bankers Trust.

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk  September 15, 2000 Raymond Cote Vice  President, FinRad Inc.  Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a  Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that  combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and  financial institutions.  Abstract:  Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little  attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank  liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After  introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a  framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then  shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools  leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers  concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement  framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

kaminski-v	 Hi Paul and Anad, please make the appropriate arrangements (via Enron Corp.  AA pool) to "rotate" Martin Lin into my group. As you know, I am heading up  the EBS research unit that is reporting to Vince Kaminski and Stinson Gibner  (MD & VP of Enron Research Group, respectively).  Martin will work for Jim  Irvine and report to him on a day-to-day basis.  Martin will spend most of  his time at Jim's office location.  This arrangement is very similar to Samar  Khleif's role in Portland with John McClain's broadband delivery group.    Martin has already discussed his rotation with Jim Irvine and scheduled to  start on March 1, 00.   EBS Research will be working very closely with Jim  Irvine and John Griebling in the area of Network Planning and Model  Development (Traffic Engineering in telecom-speak).  Martin has a Ph.D. in  Electrical Engineering and has been working within Research supporting  electricity transmission analysis and modeling.  Regards,  Ravi.

beck-s	 For your information, our business SAP group and IT members persuaded our  Unify users to use SAP AR rather than continuing to use Unify AR.  This is a  change of the decision that was made two year ago.  However, since all other  Enron companies will be using SAP AR, there is a definite benefit in using  the same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation  and related SAP interfaces (i.e. cash application, netting, deposit load).    Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities  (since Unify has more flexibility),  we felt that it will be to everyone's  benefit to have the entire company's AR in the same system.   Please see  attached table for details.  Thank you.

kaminski-v	 Michael,  The science of measuring operational risk is in its early stages of  development. There are really no cook-book  solutions. One has to use creativity and a lot of common sense.  Vince    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Operational Risk  Mr. Kaminsky,  Recently, I read articles published by GARP and monographs in a book  published by GARP.  Although they are excellent sources of introduction to  operational risk, none of them have any details on the "how to."  If you know of a good book or book(s) could you recommend one?    Thank you.  Michael Kim

Romeo:   Please do Step 1 today, 10/4/00.  1.  Please change the confirmed noms to zero for all contracts that have be  nominated for period 1/1/00 thru 10/31/00 for the above meter. 2.  Change the allocation method to "Not Allocatable" effective 1/1/99. 3.  Please reallocate the meter for period 1/1/99 thru 10/31/00. 4.  Call me after the above tasks have been completed.  Step  II.  Sherlyn:  Please check the following tommorrow, 10/5/00.  1   Verify with Settlements that the zero BAV adjustment were received  for  all Contract Activities at Meter 986892 for period 1/1/99 thru 9/30/00. 2.  After verification is complete, please call me.  Step III.  Donna:  I will call you tomorrow, 10/5/00 to inform when you can make the  following changes:  1.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 501026.  This facility should  be Trade and Nom "YES". 2.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 515136.

After completion, please let me know.  ********  Gary:  This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed  volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892   today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at  meter #980439.  Daren:  This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should  clear within 24 to 48 hours.  Victor:  This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes  for you.    IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.  THANKS, CLEM

As you know we will be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to bring our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are working with Duke, and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!  Best Regards,  Aisha Jamal Energy Institute 713-743-4634         
kaminski-v	 Hello everyone.  It is time for the Spring recruiting season to begin and  select the candidates we would like to have on our pre-select list.

beck-s	 I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into  this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than  attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.  Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers  and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is  primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It  provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only  determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance  management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:  a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate  ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress  towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the  further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities.  Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;  b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues  category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate  documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure  performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus  on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is  always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should  focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the  issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction  with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the  organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will  require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement  and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of  action to rectify performance.  Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC  currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above  with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be  communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.  Other identified action items from the meetings include:  a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's  A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at  the July 19th meeting;  b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to  continue rotating within ENA;  c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for  Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;  and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment  candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a  timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.  Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.  Regards Mark and Dave 
beck-s	 Dear Sally,  I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon, as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight. There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.  I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I enjoyed meeting her.  Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.  It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy the spacious large room.  I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be easily treated.  I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully. Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.  It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.  Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have some visits with us!  I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous daughter.  I am very proud of you.  Much love,  Mom  Mom

beck-s	 Thanks   for the note -- that helps to put it into perspective.   Unfortunately, since Sally is out this week, I had not seen this note.  James has all of the marginal cost information, which can be used to work  from  - I still believe that the approach we discussed in our meeting before  lunch today is the right one.  We need to create some customer profiles which  include the number of transactions at each level and for each of the  potential services to calculate some potential cost base scenarios ---  from  which we can gross up to a potential revenue number.    Rahil -- I would like to discuss the next steps, and who we put on point  (specifically) for each task.  Beth   -----Original Message----- From:  Eichmann, Marc   Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 12:19 PM To: Apollo, Beth Cc: Jafry, Rahil; Scribner, James Subject: FW: Deal models  Here is the message I received from Greg, which I just told you and Rahil  about today.   I would really like to use Rahil's expertise at EOL to try to size the  potential market going forward. On the other side, I would appreciate getting  feedback about the marginal per transaction cost at different volume levels  as presented in the document we discussed this morning. I will be available  to help in any way needed.  Thanks in advance for your help   Marc   -----Original Message----- From:  Piper, Greg   Sent: Thursday, March 15, 2001 2:59 PM To: Eichmann, Marc Cc: Zipper, Andy; Gros, Thomas D.; Beck, Sally; Raghavan, Suresh; Bartlett,  Jeff; Shelby, Rex Subject: Deal models  We need to finalize the 4 models that have a high, low and expected case for  our businesses.  They are CommodityLogic, DealBench, TransactionHub and  Mid/Back Office.  DealBench should be built as an ASP as discussed,  CommodityLogic as an ASP, TransactionHub as we have discussed and back office  as you are working with Sally.        We first need to agree on all the assumptions for revenue that lead to each  case suggested above for each business.  We then need to agree on 5 to 10  years of expenses so we can reach an operating margin we agree upon.  We then  finally need to look at them and see what capital investment might be needed  to go in to each one and then finally build a pretax income statement and  pretax cash flow statement for each business.  The goal is to determine, within a range, the present value of each business,  based on certain assumptions, and then to determine what they are worth as a  company.  I know we are part way there on all of these initiatives, but I want this all  finished as follows:  TransactionHub - Friday afternoon the 16th.  CommodityLogic - Tuesday afternoon the 19th  DealBench - Wednesday afternoon the 17th  Mid/Back Office - Friday the 23rd  Remember, we are trying to get a range that is approximately right that we  can all believe.  Your thoughts?  GP

kaminski-v	 Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.  By copy of this memo I am forwarding  Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.  Danny and Phil: Please  follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.  He seems  to be a very qualified candidate.

Peter is looking currently for a job.  I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with  Mathematics society at the University of Houston.  The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further  efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor  fuel.  Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

beck-s	 I agree with the section written for settlements. I would very much like to  be included in your meeting.  Thanks,  Bob       
beck-s	 Dear Cassandra,  Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the  individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the  traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very  helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of  violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit  attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed  earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier,  and this is a real set back to that process.  Thoughts?     To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael Benien/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris  Abel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel Falcone/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Veronica Valdez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process  Shona -  To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template  was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group  is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your  request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised  reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until  you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L  notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday  should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should  help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business  unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.  Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation  explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that  commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is  responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the  commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops  for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these  explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit  controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance  obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit  controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback  (as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like  me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just  let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their  explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long  and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and  should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based  on the market moves, etc..   Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.  Regards, Cassandra.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron on 12/07/2000  09:48 AM ---------------------------

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are being effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.  By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for upcoming years.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.  Sincerely,  Lexi Elliott 713/853-4585   
kaminski-v	 Dear guys  Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the  victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from  its "hiding place" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep  the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the  drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on  or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone  sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my  desk extensively reshuffled last week.  Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen  from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a  random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so  interested in a Research guy's belongings!  Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious  activity around my desk?  Cheers, Steve

farmer-d	 Daren,  Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling  the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a  strong case could be made in favor of that idea.  It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing,  nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge  base and the responsibility factor. It is a "Who's on First" issue.  If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of market  intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the  schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and  POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services  immensely.  As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and  more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes  they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.  I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to  handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to  think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the only  person that should be involved in the Industrials.  I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you  and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat  that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite  alright.  Once again, thanks for listening.  Ken  - att1.htm 
kaminski-v	 Eric,  I think we can skip the meeting and discuss any issues between us. The meeting was convened at the request of Doug Arnell, but Jeff Shankman thinks that there is no need for formal meetings: we can ask them for the information directly on as needed basis.  Vince         
farmer-d	 In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara  was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same  Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is  tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity  tickets to reflect the "other" desks:  a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path  Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like    "Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434  and will be removed." b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract  that you were using in the new path. c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy. d.  On the new deal:  Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply  or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a contract for which we are    agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new  desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select  the contract.  Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.   Un-check it.  On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated  rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and   any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.  Hit Release. e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number  in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list  the  specific deals. f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message  should not appear again.  This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract. Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.  Thanks, d.n.

kaminski-v	 I agree with Vince.  Ideally, this visit would supplement rather than  duplicate effort.  However, on the front end, I would prefer a little  overkill to underkill - especially with respect to the VAR process.  I would  defer to Anjam/Tanya's opinion as to what is necessary to get an initial  comfort level.  Remember that this is the first cut, but it will need to be  refined over time to the point where it is credible enough to force someone  to take a position down based on the calculatiion.  If this causes some  heartburn please refer those people to me.

As I don't really work directly on those sorts of things anymore I would need  some help putting anything together- I am happy with the theory, I would just need to  present some results. It is a risk conference in London/New York in February.  If I can't accept it soonish I'll have to turn it down.  The organiser has another person in mind and I don't want to give a rubbish  talk.

kaminski-v	 Vince-  It seems like we should be able use MG's V@R methodology as version 1.a if  the credit component is eliminated and the hold period is conformed to our  one day interval.  Could we do this and achieve an approximation of where you  want to be with the completion of Anjam and Tamara's work?  When submitting a  request for Interim Metals Trading Policy to Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling, I'd  very much like to represent that, while our methodology may be imperfect, we  have ways + means of tracking V@R right now that will be upgraded to Enron  standards in very short order.

kaminski-v	 Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at  pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:   PJM has launched a pilot version of eData which includes data from the New York Independent System Operator.  The beta-test period for the pilot is expected to last approximately 90 days as PJM evaluates the success of using cross-ISO data in eData.  If the pilot proves successful, PJM may add data  from other ISOs in the future.   This pilot version of eData is a result of the collaboration among the ISOs created by the Memorandum of Understanding signed last year.  Through the ISO MOU process, stakeholders have asked the ISOs to improve seams issues, create like user interfaces, and make it easier to do business between the  ISOs. The addition of other ISO data to eData has several benefits to users  including consolidated information, ease of use, less technical support required, and improved customer service.  Real-time prices, forecasted/actual loads, tie  line schedules, and transmission limits are all possible types of information that may be included in the future.   eData was implemented in October 1998.  There are currently more that 1700 registered users representing over 200 companies.  Users include  marketers, utilities, control areas, state and federal regulators, educational organizations, financial institutions and others.  The tool continues to  attract 30 to 40 new registered users each week.  Normally, 100 - 300 users are simultaneously logged onto the system.

While I am happy for him and believe that the  company will benefit from his services, I am concerned that he may not be  available at a crucial time in the development of the EAM option strategy.  The EAM desk is continuing to develop standard models for the bulk of our ECM  projects. We have hired 4 people in the past month and all of them will be  working by early September. Osman provides an important link for our new  staff to several core areas of our business. First, his experience with  modeling and energy analysis are invaluable. Second, as we move to treating  our projects as options, and pricing them as such, Osman will be needed to  assist us in creating auditable methods to assess savings volatility.  I am expecting two of the team members to start in San Francisco in the near  future. My request is for Osman to be available to this team for one day a  week for the next several months, preferably until Christmas.  Thank you for your consideration of this matter.  Steve Kromer

kaminski-v	 Hi Jeff,  
kaminski-v	 At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under  certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to California's "seriously flawed" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the West.  The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000  Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power  Markets, is available at the following website:  http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm  In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and  solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also  been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners  supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker  and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and  Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either  "over-reached" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is  expected to be issued by year's end.  At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3)  siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements.  Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy  In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:  (1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's  investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.  (2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in  order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.  (3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO  and PX.  (4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a  temporary $150/MWh "soft cap" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150  from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers  bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly  basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to  report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.  (5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and  utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until  December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if  FERC finds non-competitive behavior.  (6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs.  Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price  capping authority.  Commissioner Responses  Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California  markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the  "buy and sell" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long  list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the  Commission prescribe specific remedies.  Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "soft cap"  concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but  allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO  filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity.  Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's  job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct "command and  control."  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that  they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements.  Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach.  He feels that the Congress has "put its thumb on the scale" in the  Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right  direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to  reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell  mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility.  Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted  that this is "no time to pull punches."  He emphasized that the Commission  needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he  stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing  jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "meandering transition" to competition.  He feels  that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these  problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

kaminski-v	 Van,  Thanks for your message. We are taking a  number of interns this summer,  but  the A&A program has closed the books for this year. We were able to reopen the list to add one candidate a few weeks ago, but cannot do it again. We promised it  would be the last addition.  Vince       Van Ngo <vngo@rice.edu> on 04/23/2000 11:42:54 AM To: Vince Kaminski <vkamins@enron.com> cc:   Subject: summer   Dear Vince,   I'm writing to let you know that I have been in touch with Christy Young from  the A&A Program and will be finding out my assignment for this summer soon.?  I am very excited to be back at Enron, and I hope to see the Research team  again.   I'd also like to inquire about summer positions within Research.? Will the  Research group be taking on another intern this summer?? Since I know there  is no busier place at Enron than the Research Group, if there is a position  available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open  for consideration, I would love to connect you to another Rice student.   Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this  summer.? If so, I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone, a  senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with  both his B.S. and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May.? Brad has  gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years.? His  academic focus gives him a strong mathematical, quantitative background and  excellent computer skills.? I believe his skills are transferable and  relevant to the Group, and he is a deeply dedicated individual.? If the  Research Group is looking for a summer intern, I hope it will continue  Enron's strong support and recruit of Rice University students.   Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion. (As I  realize the summer months are not far off, if it is easier, an arrangement  through ProStaff may be made similar to my work extension at the end of last  summer).? I have attached a copy of his resume for your review.? Brad will be  in Houston this summer.? His contact information is given below.   James Bradley (Brad) Aimone  6320 Main, Houston, TX? 77005  713-630-8035  imaknee@rice.edu  ?   Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.? I sincerely  hope that you will have the opportunity to discover the contributions Brad  can make to the Research Group.? I certainly know that he would gain  tremendously from the experience as I did last summer.   Thank you very much for your consideration.   Sincerely,  Van   Ph: 713-630-8038   - Brad_Resume.doc

kaminski-v	 Jeff,  A short follow up on the P+ options.  Attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads  between futures contracts.   It shows correlation over four different time  horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair.   As you can  see the level is usually higher than 0.98 and often near 0.99.    If our  current book of "index P+" options were re-marked at a 98% correlation, it  would result in a  reduction in M-T-M value of about $78 million according to  my estimate.    
kaminski-v	 Please find the interview packet for the above-referenced person.  The  interview will occur on Friday  October 27, 2000.  Please print all three  documents for your reference.  If you have any questions, or conflicts of  schedule, please do not hesitate to contact me.        Stephanie  58701 
kaminski-v	 Darren,  Tanya and I had a telephone interview for Yumi.    I do not know what kind of position you would offer her.  If you intended to let her do the work on quantitative modeling, her knowledge in math seems very sallow.  She is working on a math degree on stochastic process, but she can not explain what Ito' lemma is.  We also asked questions about volatility of a basket, value at risk, etc. she did not have a clear  answer.  If you intended to let her to be a junior trader, she might be ok. It seems  she has some experience of financial market, but I think you are much more qualified  to probe her than I do in this aspect.

They would like to ask you to briefly expound on  your  mathematical studies. If you could please contact them  next Wednesday at  7:50 AM (it should be 4:50 PM Houston time, Tuesday). The conversation should  take no more than 20 minutes of your time, and will enable us to get a more  enhanced understanding of your quantitative abilities.

Pavel ---------------------- Forwarded by Pavel Zadorozhny/HOU/ECT on 01/12/2001  01:37 PM ---------------------------   Dmitri Villevald <Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu> on 01/03/2001  06:56:54 PM To: "Pavel Zadorozhny (E-mail)" <pavel.zadorozhny@enron.com> cc:   Subject: asking for advice regarding Summer Associate position at Enron   Dear Mr. Zadorozhny:  Maxim Philippov suggested that I write you. Being a first-year MBA student at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.  The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products (commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a Summer Associate.  I would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at Enron and would like to find out more about Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. I will call you within this week to follow up on my request.  Thank you very much for your time.  Sincerely,  Dmitri Villevald  Enclosure: resume   <<Resume.doc>> P.S. Looking through an example of margin risk hedging at Enron's Web site, I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is  <http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer application)  The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "Paradigm and Enron exchange..." states the following.  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.  I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the opposite direction, namely:  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.62/MMBtu.  Am I right?  Again, thank you very much for your time.     - Resume.doc

Steve Roeder is a former collegiate  swimmer and currently coach of the master's swimming program in The Woodlands  (my wife is president of the program).  He is also currently employed at Air  Liquide USA (or one of its subsidiaries) over in the Galleria area.  As a  consequence of Air Liquide's pending merger with BOC, Steve believes that  there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is  taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge.  Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful  if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested.   Alternatively, if you don't see a fit (or are adequately staffed at the  moment), I would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom I  might contact internally on Steve's behalf.

farmer-d	 Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.    The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.    We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.  Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.    In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.  The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.  Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.    Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!  Stan

UT alumni  all over the world have followed this tradition. Wherever you are on March 2, 2001, we  hope you'll join us in a Texas "toast":  To our State, whose founders made our education  possible; To Texas Exes who have provided generations of leadership; And to the proud  tradition of continued excellence of The University of Texas.Hook'em Horns!

Diana McLaughlin to review.  2)  ZICI--Prepays on intercompany foreign invoices.  Laurel to contact Pamela  Lebrane and establish a game plan.  3)  ZICR--report to identify items to be reallocated by trading partner.  Ana  to create--Rena/Diana to assist if necessary.  4)  BAI codes for activity in Citibank London :  Laurel and Phyllis to  contact Brian Silver and Lisa Raye  5)  EURO account--items sent back from the bank and posted in USD  equivalents.  Treasury has been notified and is researching.  Laurel &  Phyllis to follow up.  6)  "Not to be posted" cash.  This causes problems with Cash Application, and  receivables.  Phyllis/Rena to follow up with Brian Silver & Lori Scott  7)  Autoclear Inflo account--Rena to talk with Becky Ford about putting this  on as a scheduled overnight job.  8)  Outflow account--Laurel, Cynthia, and Phyllis to continue researching  outstanding items.    9)  Yen--Brian Silver & Lori Scott.  Need a solution quickly, as JPY activity  is increasing--we just had a trader move over to Japan.    I THINK I covered everything we talked about.   Please feel free to correct  me!!

kaminski-v	 Vince:  Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays, and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks again and best regards.  Dale Nesbitt  PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.   - longexecsum.DOC

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it would be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and I am planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities, which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing and research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wondered whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.  I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be fantastic Vince.

kaminski-v	 1. California AG Exploring Investigation of Power Profits  Sources report that the California Attorney General's office,in a meeting  yesterday, ordered a review of the Federal Profiteering Statute.  In keeping  with the recent  rhetoric by Gov. Davis, this action is almost certainly directed toward  investigations of profits made by generators and marketers.  2. More Detail on Bankruptcy- Creditors Concerned About Lengthy "Cure Period"  The generators want to limit their exposure as general creditors in a Chapter  11 proceeding. Their ability to their exposure depends on the "cure period"  for  making good on a defaulted payment, which would be dictated by the specific  contract terms. If the "cure period" - that is, the time the utilities have  available to make up for missed payments before the generators or the power exchange can  take them to court - is a short period of time, for the sake of argument 30 days, then the utilities' creditors have to swallow another 30 days of  accumulated (impaired) receivables before they can move to the more desirable position of postpetition suppliers (in which bills do get paid, as  would be directed by the Bankruptcy Court judge). If, however, the utilities have a longer "cure period", for the sake of argument 60 days, then their  creditors will effectively have to swallow 60 days of accumulated impaired receivables on which they will ultimately have to take a substantial haircut. 
beck-s	 We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.  Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.  ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.  CORPORATE STAFF   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20 Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In= =20 that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and= =20 Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an= d=20 Chief of Staff.  COMMITTEE STRUCTURE   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s= =20 growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20 business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to= =20 be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a= nd=20 the coordination of activities across those businesses.

kaminski-v	 Bob,  I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you  about on the phone.    I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction  by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the  transaction to you.  Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just  returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.  He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would  like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion  please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to  market.  Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from  the Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may  need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account  for these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there  will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon  consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that  we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through  Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.  Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the  US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in  India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income  showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get  treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the  US.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of  the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F  and other concerns).  Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and  getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to  Indian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type  of accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about,  and will brief you on the same.  Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.  Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting  project for us all.  Regards, Sandeep. 
kaminski-v	 Please, use a new template stored in the   Plans2001   folder for today's project lists.  Over the last few weeks we had several parallel copies of the same file floating around.

For the DPR we put a 'top side' adjustment  through but because of the time it would take to re calc no re calc was  performed. This should have been covered in the daily conference call. Was it  ?  For UK Gas, I thought this issue was closed on the conference call. We used  the 30th as our month end as a result of the way the month end fell. The guys  have now clicked the 'officialised' button for the 29th if it helps you, but  we did not use that data (there shouldn't be anything materially wrong with  it though).  What I think this highlights is that we will have days where we do not  officialise and do not re run. In these circumstances we will put a top side  through. We therefore need a mechanism to communicate this top side and I  would request we get this in place as soon as possible (this has been  requested a few times before).  Does this answer your questions ?  James         From:  Debbie R Brackett                                                              04/10/2000 14:25

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on  Saturday, so has suggested I attend, which I am happy to do. My only  reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is  likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so  that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current  relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine  or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be  discussed.  Many thanks,  Ben ---------------------- Forwarded by Benjamin Parsons/LON/ECT on 08/06/2000  08:36 ---------------------------   Bryan Seyfried 06/06/2000 16:46 To: Benjamin Parsons/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Wharton Event-June10-Insead   ---------------------- Forwarded by Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT on 06/06/2000  16:48 ---------------------------   Vince J Kaminski 05/06/2000 15:13 To: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Wharton Event-June10-Insead  Bryan,  I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from  Ben.  I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to  the Wharton School about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or  more  research projects with them.  One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a  symposium in Paris on June 10  on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to  evaluate the usefulness of this project.  I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation, agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or you can call him at 215-898-1231.  This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of the partnership "benefits."  Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:  Friday, September 8 "WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?" This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited. We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative. Major issues addresses include "New Economics of the Web" and "Internet, Anywhere."  Friday, October 20 "FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES" Designed by the ET core group and presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.  As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join the program.  To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the symposium in Paris on June 10 to "test drive" the program.  I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program would be of value.  Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.  best regards, Michael    - Insead workshop Invitation lett - Insead Workshop Agenda1.doc - RSVP  form.doc Michael S.

kaminski-v	 Steve,  RAC will be a bit unhappy about it. I think that Bjorn will object to it. Let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it. The question is how to present it to RAC in a such a way that Rodrigo will not be put in a bad light.  Vince      Steven Leppard 11/06/2000 06:37 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: In confidence  Hi Vince  I've had a chat with Rodrigo Lamas, who is a bit unhappy in his current role  in RAC (he wants to be a bit more proactive, and finds the inertia  frustrating).  I would be very interested in bringing him into Research with  responsibility for VaR/risk mgt, which is where his professional experience  lies.  He also has a PhD in optimization from Imperial College London which  I'm sure we can make use of.  There will obviously be some political issues involving such a move only 4  months into his career at Enron, and if you're able then I'm sure he'd  appreciate a chat with you.  We're awaiting your response before Rodrigo mentions this to anyone else.  Steve  
kaminski-v	      Dear Vince:       I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning tool. Several of them, however, do contain  innovations.          I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.       As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will spawn.       I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of the players in the street.       The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely) is: If there is interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?       I look forward to hearing from  you soon.       Best regards       Joao

farmer-d	 Daren,  Charlotte Hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5,733 with El  Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their  nomination as follows:  C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom  EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300  Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.   Thanks.

farmer-d	 Mobil says the low point of their takes will be during February will be from  Feb 1 to 14.  So any day in that time period would be a good time for HPL to  do the required maintenance at the Texoma-Beaumont system interconnect.  We need to define our game plan:  - what day to do the work - how much gas HPL will deliver through our own meter - how we use Centana to deliver the rest of the HPL volumes - if we had planned in Feb to baseload some of our MidCon obligation at Mobil  as we have done in Dec and Jan, then we will need to do something different  whenever we do the maintenance  James - we are scheduled to meet with Mobil in Beaumont at 10.30am Thursday  Feb 1, to go over the game plan with them.  Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend?  Thanks  Lee

beck-s	 Thanks for the slides.  There really is nothing new under the sun.  The key  is to identify the source of competitive advantage.  To my mind it's the same  line of thought that leads us to see EOL as sustainable, but neutral B2B  marketplaces as temporary.  Our only competitive advantage is that we are the  largest principal member of the potential club, making our participation most  critical.  Given this, our timing and positioning relative to potentially  joining others may be the single most important strategic decision we make.   I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on any other elements of competitve  advantage that we could leverage, particularly those elements that are most  sustainable.

kaminski-v	 Vince The audience consist of mostly first year graduate students in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research some doctoral students and faculty. A short introduction about opportunities for quantitative minded people at Enron would be good. It would also be good if in your talk you can give some technical examples for people with a good analytic background but no much of a financial engineering background. Many of the first year graduate students go for a masters degree and wonder what they can do with an OR masters degree.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Shmuel S.

kaminski-v	  Hi,  
farmer-d	 Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated?  I am getting mixed information.  I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).  The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.  Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.  In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.  For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.  James Armstrong is using the actual volume.  The deal for the fee is 514353.  My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.  Should the transport volume be in the calculation?  Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.   Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?  If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy.  You can fax it to 713-571-3141.  If none of this makes sense, give me a call and I can try and explain further.     Thanks, Megan 713-571-3261

Authority to trade a commodity for which you are not the=20 authorized trader must be obtained from the Business Unit Office of the=20 Chairman for the commodity group that is authorized to trade that commodity= ,=20 with appropriate reporting as noted below.  Policy amendments were as follows:  u Clarify the cross-commodity trading policy to specify that trading limits= =20 are to be applied against Enron=01,s consolidated commodity positions on an= =20 individual commodity group basis;  Enron=01,s consolidated Daily Position R= eport=20 should provide required market risk disclosures by primary commodity group;= =20 (for example, Enron=01,s exposure to the North American Natural Gas market = shall=20 be aggregated across the company).  =01) Delegate cross-commodity trading approval among established commodity= =20 groups to the respective Business Units Offices of the Chairman, with=20 appropriate reporting to the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer.  u Specify the operational control requirement that all trades executed over= =20 the telephone must be recorded electronically.  Below are relevant excerpts from the revised policy addressing the=20 cross-commodity trading guidelines.  I will distribute the entire updated= =20 policy as soon as we incorporate the BOD's comments.  V. Operations and Controls.  B.  Position Reporting. "...For purposes of limit monitoring and aggregation of Enron=01,s consolid= ated=20 trading results, Enron=01,s consolidated Daily Position Report should inclu= de=20 the Net Open Position, Maturity/Gap Position, profit or loss, and potential= =20 exposure (VaR) for approved Commodity Groups consolidated across the compan= y=20 without regard to which business unit undertook the trading activity.

"Only those employees designated by= =20 the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer or his designee(s) will be authorized to= =20 enter into Transactions on behalf of Enron.  The Chief Risk Officer must al= so=20 maintain a record of those employees responsible for the individual Commodi= ty=20 Groups (Commodity Group Manager) as specified in the Appendices.  Individua= ls=20 will be assigned as commodity leaders to manage Enron=01,s aggregate positi= on=20 across the company as determined necessary by the Chief Risk Officer..."  VI.  Policy Amendment Authority B. Cross-Commodity Position Authorization.  If in the ordinary course of it= s=20 business an Enron Business Unit or trading desk incurs an exposure to an=20 underlying commodity or financial instrument for which it does not have=20 explicit authority to carry, this exposure should be hedged internally with= =20 the appropriate Enron desk(s), with appropriate notification to the Chief= =20 Risk Officer or his designee(s).  Hedge positions should be in instruments= =20 that have an observable correlation with the underlying exposure, and shoul= d=20 be rebalanced regularly to substantially neutralize the underlying exposure= . =20   Upon notification to the Chief Risk Officer or his designee(s), the Enron= =20 Business Unit Office of the Chairman who has authority for that commodity= =20 group may authorize a specific trader in a different commodity group to tak= e=20 speculative positions with other Enron trading desks in commodities and/or= =20 financial instruments other than those which that trader has explicit=20 authority to trade (i.e. the Business Unit Office of the Chairman for North= =20 American Natural Gas may authorize a trader in the Coal group to trade gas= =20 with the North American Natural Gas desk).    For limit monitoring purposes= =20 of Enron=01,s consolidated trading results, these cross-commodity positions= =20 shall be captured by individual commodity to facilitate aggregation and=20 reporting of Enron=01,s consolidated exposure by commodity in the Daily Pos= ition=20 Report (Coal desk=01,s gas position will be aggregated with the North Ameri= can=20 Natural Gas commodity group.)

kaminski-v	 Omar, thanks for the presentation and the e-mail.  As I tried to emphasize on  the phone call, there will be short-term and long-term efforts to utilize  OPNET. Often the short-term needs rules at EBS.  We will sort out what they  during our discussion in Houston.  I am confirming the meeting in Houston  6-8th.  I shall ask Shirely Crenshaw to arrange for a conference room on the 19th  floor. The meeting will be held all day from April 6th, 7th and half day 8th.  The 8th is a saturday and the meeting will be held to wrap things up if  needed.  Ravi.      Background info. for Enron Research People.  OPNET is a simulation tool that  many in the industry use to do capacity planning to IP based applications and  services on a network.  Detail adenda will follow.  I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this morning to discuss the performance engineering program at EBS. I think you'll find that the value to Enron from the overall approach is quite high. I have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers that need to be addressed as we move forward. As I work with you, I think we'll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when.  As soon as you confirm your schedule for April 6-8, I'll book my travel to get to Houston. I've already put in a call to OPNET Technologies to have them get a resource out to Houston on one of those days for a demonstration and Q & A about the OPNET toolset.  I'll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in Houston and get it out to you next week.  If there are any questions, please email me at  ozaidi@lucent.com  You can also call me at 503 778 0653. I am also pageable at 1 800 467 1467.  Have a great weekend and I look forward to hearing from you next week about the April 6-8 meeting.  Best wishes....

Hi everyone,  I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some=20 questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid=20 writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so=20 exclusive, this will have to do for now.  Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure=20 complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode= ls=20 for each contract. However, the JC Penny=01,s version can serve as a testin= g=20 platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to= =20 the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so= =20 some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get bac= k.=20  1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to= =20 regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and= =20 re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done alrea= dy.  2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input cred= it=20 rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contrac= t=20 period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me tha= t=20 the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating=20 transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies=20 changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some=20 constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a= =20 more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.  3) Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that= =20 the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different=20 business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we a= re=20 dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not= =20 get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom= ery=20 Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so=20 fundamental for a company=01,s success and default actions can be used as a=  way=20 to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does no= t=20 neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.  4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for=  a=20 life preserver are more likely to live than those that don=01,t. By that I = mean=20 that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th= e=20 credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=20 contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn=01,t= .=20 This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn=01,t consider. Th= is=20 would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables= =20 and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.  5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special financ= e=20 team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If = we=20 can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a= =20 better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the= =20 current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop= =20 some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.  6) A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments.=20 Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent=20 error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random numb= er=20 generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a proble= m=20 in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effe= ct=20 of using different random number generators on Enron=01,s aggregate credit = risk?  7) There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improve= d"=20 analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20  Rick=20

beck-s	 I have asked Shelly Jones to send me a complete list of the analysts from OU  that will start in July.  I'll will contact her again today if she doesn't get back with me.    I think  it would be a great idea to invite Ted.  His e-mail is  tjacobs@ou.edu.  It might also be a good idea to invite George Hope.

beck-s	 Just thought I would give you all an update on the pilot.  We sent out an  annoucement last night "water dropping" the classes and inviting others to  participate.  As of 10:00 this morning, most classes were filled and a  waiting list was developing.    Several  observations: most people were signing up for 1-2 classes, so the decision to run these in  half-day increments was a good choice on your part the fact that there is already a waiting list after two hours shows the  pent-up demand for this type of skill building program the skills you have targeted were right on.  That is not to say there are not  other ones that are needed, but clearly these first ones are needed  If you have a couple of folks you want to fit in and did not get time to get  those to us, please give me a call or send me an e-mail and I will get them  in.  Gracie and Janice are overwhelmed by Ernie calls that have been  extremely heavy these past two days.  I think I can pull some strings for you  all!  Again, just thought I would keep you posted and thought you might want to pat  yourself on the back for some great work and great choices

kaminski-v	 Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of  Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some  of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference  in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve  to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.  As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this  award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's  Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values  will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in  San Antonio in November.  The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven  from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee  committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the  Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is  extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive  impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and  send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a  printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc  For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last  year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye  Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom  Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for  your participation.

beck-s	 Which commodities does this impact?  Is it only concs?      Mike Jordan@ECT 07/27/2000 03:39 AM To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure  Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim -  says a lot about the way MG do business I think.  RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip  Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a  contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have  some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates  appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often  discounted to realise cash!!  Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment  yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were  'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer  preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the  enforceability/legal risk here.  Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London -  accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful  Will call later ! ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 27/07/2000 09:33  ---------------------------   Tim Poullain-Patterson 26/07/2000 21:53 To: Eric Gadd/LON/ECT@ECT, Goran Novakovic/LON/ECT@ECT, Robert  Quick/LON/ECT@ECT, David Hardy/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin  Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Howard Carter/The Metal & Commodity Co Ltd/MGLTD@MGLTD cc: Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Diana Higgins/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Bjorn Hagelmann/HOU/ECT@ECT,  David P Tregar/MGLTD_London/MGLTD@MGLTD   Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure  The situation at present is as follows:  MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper  from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis  all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)  notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm  prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value  with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents  The issues break down into three broad areas:  1) Commercial  At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian  Federation counterparties.  No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this  activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with  Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising  from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps  to manage down existing prepayment exposures.  2) Legal  Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to  continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for  several reasons, including:  the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms,  e.g. pricing date  they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not  constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.  "Conditions of Purchase" are attached to the confirmations which refer to  English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules  the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the  absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.  there are several "open" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are  beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been  discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate  language.  3) Credit/Operational  There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric  exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is  necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be  factored into the overall credit monitoring process.  David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off  exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track  exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.   Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that,  despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance  against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and  will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.  The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to  accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in  all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with  Justin.  Any questions, please call.  Regards, Tim

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Chonawee and Tom Halliburton had  feedback about Jacob to me.  Tom's feedback is what he does for Pros is actually too simple. Their  so-called  trading system is actually a scheduling system.  My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge of finance and derivatives is very limited.    Zimin     ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 04/11/2001 03:31 PM  ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 03/21/2001 07:28 PM To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tom Halliburton/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: Jacob feedback   I asked Jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered  correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good  foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic  skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his  previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview  time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.  He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his  basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak  background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the  relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in  annuity calculation.   In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak  background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his  advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to  attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round  interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.   -Chonawee

It was November 3, 1999 when I asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation  days to the next year . I was thinking that if you (or HR) do not approve I could at least take these  days in 1999.   I know that your tried to help me and sent to  Brad McSherry the  justification for me to carry over 10 days. I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your  response was optimistic I did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.  Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake.  I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/00 to 3/17/00).  What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response  from HR in November or December last year would be better than loosing vacation days.  I really appreciate your help, Tanya.

I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).  Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry  over my 10  vacation days to the next year?  If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations  anyhow. I would really prefer not to take off most of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.

kaminski-v	 Dear Vince,  Please find the following description of the program that I would like to raise additional funding for.  I will follow up today with a phone call to answer any questions you may have.  As always we appreciate your time and support.  Thanks, Jozef  The Eastern European students at MIT Sloan School of Management are preparing an Eastern European week to be held in March 2001.  The one-week long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries that are going through the post communist transformation. As you well know, Eastern Europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies. Unfortunately, it also presents many obstacles that make most of the opportunities difficult to capture.  Because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles, we want to bring the Eastern European experience to MIT Sloan School of Management.  Familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries is only one step toward reforming Eastern Europe, but we believe it is worth our time and effort.  During the week, we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the business environment in Eastern Europe.  We want to emphasize especially the success stories from Eastern Europe.  Such companies as Enron, Volkswagen, ExxonMobil, GM, and GE have entered the Eastern European market and show commitment to stay in it.  In at least one panel discussion with academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know that Eastern Europe is a real place for business.  In addition to the educational activities, we are preparing number of cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area.  The scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to raise from our sponsors.  In return, we plan to advertise our sponsors in every activity we will do.  We will make banners and any other appropriate advertising as desired by the sponsor.  Should a sponsor be willing to send a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech/lecture we would appreciate the enrichment to our program.  The advertising will reach nearly 700 Sloan students and faculty.  In addition, the advertising will reach all newly admitted students, as they will visit our campus for the AdMIT day (an official program to sell our school to the admitted students).

Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing  electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter  this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing  wind and solar, renewable energy.  2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop  Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.  3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would  involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.  4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant  quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.   That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The  mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic  dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will  produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the "movement" or change in  the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing  a steady or reliable electrical current.  I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent  opinion of this proposal.  Respectfully,  Dr. Stinson Gibner PhD. Physics VP Research, Enron North America  P.S.   Kevin and Zimin:  If you have any interest in reviewing Mr. Patteson's  proposal, please let me know.

We've finally got our computers hooked up, so we are off and  running now.  Actually, we got quite of few projects going on up here (yes,  these are real projects) and we are going to need the Houston Structuring  group for support.  I don't know if you guys are still short-handed and what  kind of projects you may already have lined-up, but I wanted list out some of  the projects that we are currently working on.  GAS  LRG project -  Deirde is currently working on this with Russell  NSS storage - Sean Boyle helped value both their current and new NSS.  We are  currently working on negotiating with People's for these, and I expect that  there may be additional requests in the future.  Manlove Summer Withdraw program - Yes this is not a typo.  Surprise,  Surprise... Manlove can do a lot more than we thought.  I've talked to  Deirdre about it and created a simple model, but I would like to better  analyze this with your help.  Capital Improvements - We've got People's Christmas list of capital projects  that we are going to help them analyze and seek if any of these make sense.  Sendout model - We would like to help them better optimize their morning  sendout taking into account current market pricing and the Enron supply deal.  PBR - We are not sure when or if  People's will file a PBR, but I think that  there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that  we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace (ie transport  customers tariff restructuring)  PESC - People's is looking for assistance in understanding load following and  helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort  San Juan pricing - Evan has been working with the Desk to provide indicative  pricing with regard to PEC hedging out some of their San Juan production  reserves  Power  Power project development - we have several power projects underway and the  CTG group (Billy Lemmons) is helping us create necessary models   PESC - the retail power stuff lives.  I've think that Fallon has a new  attitude on these deals and Enron has committed to help them figure out this  market.  Power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering  balancing/storage services for Chicago area power projects.  We would like to  have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor.   We have resources in Chicago dedicated to these projects, as well as the  other stuff we're trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the  Chicago back office function.  We plan on adding our own structuring  resources (in Chicago or Houston), but we felt that we ought to start by  figuring out what support the Houston office will be able to provide.  I will  be in the office this Monday (Jan 17), so I hope to be able to catch up with  you and discuss some of these items then.  Feel free to contact me if you  need to before then at 312.357.8876 or pager 800.778.0291.  Thanks  Richard

One is as a financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects of the mobile Internet (read 3G).  On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding  (a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the ground.  (b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting, asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining.  (c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials, credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets Enron has been moving into over the last few years.  On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.  I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the room would be very important to me.  As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27, May 3/4 are good for me.

kaminski-v	 Everybody,  this week our regular meeting will be devoted primarily to 2 subjects: 1. Simulating power prices in VAR; 2. Capturing correlations across commodities as well as across term structure of forward prices.  Research will present some suggestions based on data analysis.  Detailed agenda is enclosed.  Please, let Shirley Crenshaw know if you are not planning to attend.  Tanya.   
kaminski-v	 Lance and I spoke with Tim Heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for  the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in  Tim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated  as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for  which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop  flows are also not considered a major issue at present.  In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension  to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done  little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.  Martin 
farmer-d	  Daren,    Please see below.  I need to have the purchase from (Teco) and sale to  (Teco) deals in order to allocate correctly.  For May 00, we are purchasing  from Teco.  I am allocating this to strangers gas at    moment, but it needs to go to the correct deal.  Please let me know what  the deal numbers when you have them.  Thanks  Thu

As it happens, all of the sessions you suggested are already taken!  So, would you be interested in chairing EITHER stream 1 on day 1 of the conference - "Pricing and Trading in the US Power Market"  OR stream 3 on day 2 of the conference - "Latest Developments in the US Energy Industry". For your information, the people presenting on day 1 in stream 1 include:  - Spyros Maragos, Dynegy on volatility - Sanjeev Khanna, PG & E on correlation - Gary Morsches, Southern on optimising information to accurately price and trade electricity - Blake Johnson, Stanford University on modelling power prices - Craig Pirrong, Olin School of Business, Washington University on building the optimal forward curve  On day 2, stream 3, there are only 3 talks in that stream, as after lunch we will be breaking for plenary sessions and the Industry Briefing sessions too. But the people who will be speaking in that stream are:  - Venu Nagali, Stanford University on real options - Ram Challa, Sithe Energies (he was formerly at Bankers Trust) on generation assets  I have the slot on Mergers and Acquisitions in stream 3 on day 2 as still available but I'm not sure if that session is your area of speciality?

farmer-d	 In response to Cheryl's note, in looking at a copy of a Confirmation Letter  confirming the proposed agreement reached on March 1, 2000 to be effective  April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2001, there is evergreen language.   A termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to Exxon with an original  to follow for their records.

This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the  Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal  (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will  expire at the end of this month.  To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language &  they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.  So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow  for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to  terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.  If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do  anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

It was good speaking with you this afternoon.   ?  NumeriX provides versatile solutions for the pricing and risk management of  complex derivative instruments. Of particular interest to Enron may be the  use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives.   ?  The energy solution provided is a versatile Excel/C/C++ environment for  structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace.  The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple  electricity forward curves. Power demands by utility companies are balanced  with power generating plants'?production to determine the marginal price of  electricity for multiple geographic regions. Inter-regional transmission  constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border  stations.   ?  The?energy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regional power  demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model  parameters are determined from historical data. Marginal prices from  different regions are used to determine border prices. This procedure is  iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine  the forward COB prices.  ?  I. Overview  NumeriX is a leading provider of?modular analytical toolkits and  off-the-shelf applications that are used for structuring,?pricing  and?quantifying the risk?of any?type of complex?financial instrument?or  exotic derivative.?NumeriX solutions are designed for easy integration with  existing in-house or third-party trading or risk management applications.  NumeriX solutions include:  NumeriX Tools  NumeriX FI  NumeriX FX  NumeriX EQ  Some of the key benefits of NumeriX solutions include:  Support for all asset classes  Fixed Income Instruments  Equity Instruments  Foreign Exchange Instruments  Commodity Derivatives  Credit Derivatives  Insurance Products Ability to value any complex?financial instrument?or exotic derivative  Increased instrument-valuation precision  Leading-edge valuation models and calibration routines  Enhanced risk management solutions  Stable development platform for building pricing and riskmanagement solutions?  II. NumeriX Analytics  ?

kaminski-v	 Zimin,   to generalize your initial comment, for any process dS = Mu(S,t)*S*dt +  Sigma(S,t)*S*dz, the delta-hedging argument leads to the Black-Scholes PDE.   This is true for any arbitrary functions Mu and Sigma, and so includes GBM,  Mean Reversion, and others. There is no problem with this, because in the risk-neutral world, which is  what you enter if you can hedge, the drift of the "actual" process is irrelevant.  I believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for Mean Reversion process.  This can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor,  then the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the PDE.

Hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  Zimin  ---------------------------------  In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM  ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz  where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.  Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation  for the option price, regardless of mu.    With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No  problem.  Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows,  say, mean-reverting process  ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz  Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However,  using the delta hedging argument, we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary  condition, we get the same BS formula.   Not fair !  From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the  underlying, which is the lognormal distribution. My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE  ?  The answer should be yes, but got to be from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the  delta-hedging argument ?  Thanks.

As you can see, I am now working for the FT's magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what's currently  termed the Expatriate Division and I've just passed my statutory probationary period of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew you'd hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having  gotten thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I'm investigating  several ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on one of them.  Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international private investor, specifically o HNWIs o Owner-managers o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals  and a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on something approaching equal terms  The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including the "wilder shores" such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on  a portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future) offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know  it's not bang in your sphere but I'm hoping you'll be interested enough to share your thoughts with me.  If you can give me a few pointers, I'd be grateful.

kaminski-v	 Hello Toni:  The Research Group would like to bring Bruce R. James in for an exploratory interview sometime next week (June 26 - 30).  The individuals who would be interviewing him are:  Vince Kaminski   Managing Director Stinson Gibner   Vice President Grant Masson   Vice President Vasant Shanbhogue  Vice President P. V. Krishnarao   Director Zimin Lu   Director Tanya Tamarchenko  Manager  Please ask Bruce to give you several dates within next week that would  accommodate him and we can coordinate his dates with Vince's schedule  and the schedules of the rest of the group.   Just call me when you have some dates and times.  His resume is attached.     
kaminski-v	 Perfect.  Thanks, Vince.  In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job talks to include others.  Again, since you are a member of the Risk Management Chair Search Committee (you may not know of this official capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.  I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.  bbo  At 03:38 PM 3/2/01 -0600, you wrote: >Barbara, > >I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not >offered >under the umbrella of the  seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a >closed meeting for the School faculty. > >I don't think that Enron would open its job interviews to Rice observers >who expressed interest and I made this comment to Vlady.

beck-s	 Sally,  Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about,  remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of  extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being  recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary  issue to your attention.    The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which  ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will  enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time  analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for  consistency amongst the program participants.    I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could  discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to "soften the  blow".  I look forward to your response. Thanks Shelly

Specifically  we would like to know for a given city pair for the different  existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )  1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for         the past 12 months?  2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?  3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?            (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)  4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?

farmer-d	  Jay,  Let's not assume what impact this will have. Even though it is better to zero out deals we(VM) wouldn't want to go in and zero out 2000 deals.   We do have a few questions.  I would like to discuss what minimal impact is? How do you know what impact this will have? Is there a reason this will have little impact? Do all of these D2D deals have zero volume associated with them? Who decided to do this? Why are we doing this? What time span are we talking (Production months/Year) Let's determine the impact if any?  I would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact?  thanks, m.m.   -----Original Message----- From:

The students are working hard and appreciate your insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the Wharton School.  Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.  I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.  Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel should proceed.

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince,  Been meaning to ask for your input about Larry Thorpe's proprietary model for  electricity returns.  I have not been able to get much information about the  parameters as Larry says the nature is proprietary.  It is hard to make a  judgement about its usefulness without such information.    Larry's e-mails to me indicate that he is working  on NP15 real time prices  and he promises to share the results with us.  Please advise on direction to  take as I am not quite sure about the model without further information.  Separately, Larry indicated that you had promised him some data and would  like to know if you have forwarded it to him.  I can convey your position to  him.   Thanks.

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince   Just wanted to thank you for your participation at POWER 2000  last week and  for contributing to the success of the conference. The feedback we  received  was absolutely glowing and we were delighted with the smooth-running of  the  event. Thank you for being a key part of that. As always, your presentations   went down extremely well and your presence at our events makes a big  difference,  as people are alwyas keen to hear both form you personally and  from ENRON as a  company.  As I mentioned to you, I have recently been given the  responsibility of  creating and developing a new conference stream in the  financial technology  sector under the Waters brand, so I would like to take this  opportunity to  say how much I have enjoyed working with you in the past couple  of years and  to wish you the best of luck in the future. Please stay in touch  and if you  come to New York, please let me know so I can take you out for a  drink!  Best regards and thank you again both for your patience in  helping me  research topics and for being so willing to participate at our  events. Emma ? ?

kaminski-v	 Dear Friends and Family,  On April 15 and 16 I will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on  the MS 150 which is a two day bike tour from Houston to Austin covering 182  miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.   Multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable.  Symptoms may be  mild such as numbness in the limbs, or severe paralysis or loss of vision.  Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the  unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong    My wife, Ilene was diagnosed with MS almost three years ago; at first I was  at a loss of how I could support her.  That was until I heard of the MS 150,  which is one of the greatest challenges of my life.  It is my choice to  participate in the MS 150, Ilene does not have a choice, as she has to live  with MS every day.   This will be my third year riding in the MS 150 raising money for the  National MS Society to fight multiple sclerosis. In 1998 my goal was simple.  It was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own. I succeeded in my  endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $6,000.  In 1999  I raised my goal to $10,000 and finished the tour.  Not only did I meet my  goal, but surpassed it by raising $15,000 to fight this devastating disease  with the help of my friends and family.  This year my goal is even greater!   My wife and I are once again asking for your help.  This year on the 2000 MS  150 bike tour, my goal is to raise $20,000.  Enron is a big supporter of the MS 150.  For the past two years we were the  largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally.   Last year we raised $310,000 with 300 riders.  Enron will match dollar for  dollar on all contributions donated in my name.  Using this secure, fast and  easy web page you can make a tax-deductible donation (if clicking on the link  below does not work you can cut and paste the link to your browser).   https://secure2.ntwebhosting.com/ms150/donate.asp?RiderName=John+Norden&RiderE mail=jnorden%40enron%2Ecom  If you would prefer to send a check it should be made out to the National MS  Society and sent to the address below.   I appreciate your continued support of the MS Society and the Isuzu MS 150  Bike Tour.  The funds raised on the Isuzu MS 150 Bike Tour provides  equipment, financial assistance, self-help groups, counseling, information  and resources, as well as education for people with MS and their families.  Your support truly makes a difference in the lives of people with Multiple  Sclerosis.

kaminski-v	 Good Afternoon, Mr. Kaminski!  Thank you for agreeing to an interview for a business unit article for the  next ENSIDE.  Molly Magee spoke very enthusiastically about you and your  group.  I am on your calendar for Thursday, March 1 at 10 AM.  I will bring a tape  recorder and plan to finish in 30-45 minutes.  Attached, please find some  possible questions/topics for us to discuss.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks again. Kathie Grabstald EWS Public Relations x 3-9610

From our conversation, it sounds like Enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and insurance finance.  In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of interesting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues that would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I left academics largely because I wanted to move into a more "front line" career. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I ultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my being too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly, you are concerned about hands on technical work.  I enjoy that immensely and some of the strengths I bring to the table are the ability to think creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data tell the underlying story.  I look forward to talking to you next week.  I just found out that our office building will be closed Monday, so I will not be in until Tuesday a.m.  Ray Spudeck Sr. Research Associate (816)889-4417 rspudeck@naic.org   <<resumeRES.doc>>   - resumeRES.doc

kaminski-v	 Ranendra:  I have been asked to begin the visa process for the above  individual, located in India.  I believe Mr. Shrivastava has been working as Assistant Manager with Enron  since May 10, 1998.  If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into  the US on an L1 intracompany visa under the Blanklet L for Enron.    Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him  the required visa questionnaire to begin the process.  Many thanks Margaret 713-345-5083  
beck-s	 When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:  1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)  I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get  the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books  like this and not lose good people.

I have a problem with Ravi  acting in that manner.  No one is questioning Shalesh' integrity but the  Associate Analyst program called me and stated that Shalesh told them that I  had requested the move.  If he did that he should not have used my name.  I  am very sensitive to Analysts moving within a rotation.  It has happened to  me numerous times and I do not appreciate the disruption it can cause.  If  you need Shalesh for any reason then he will not be moving.   Regards  Jim

kaminski-v	 Wicke, Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to Houston yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for London, and then Poland. I will most likely be at the Olympics in Sydney in late September, and in NY in early October. Mid-October could be the first realistic opportunity to visit with Enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in Palo Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are developing.  I am Senior Vice President for Visa USA, responsible for strategy and planning. I would probably bring with me (though I haven't discuss it yet) people in charge of our network or/and our COO.

kaminski-v	 Brad,  As per our previous discussions, Vince wanted me to give you the background  on our request to bring Patricia Tlapek into the Research Group at the very  top end of the manager group.  The justification for this was not only her  extraordinary performance in setting up our Technical Analysis Section but  also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope.  This memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning.  This past year Patricia was extremely successful in building internal  clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on  by gas, power, crude and equity marketers, as well as traders from the  Calgary office.  In addition, she developed and presented seminars to bring  traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis.  Also this last year Patricia built and populates daily the Research Group's  intranet site on technical analysis.  As a crowning achievement (but just the beginning), Patricia was given the  authority to actually trade natural gas as Jeff Shankman, Managing Director,  authorized her book for technical analysis trading.    Currently, we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel-wise  and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade  live books on other energy commodities and energy-related equities.  For these reasons, we want to peg Patricia's salary at the top of the pay  scale.  Thanks for expediting this effort.  --- Mike

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC  side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.  I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position  and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later  with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same  time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with  the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

We would like to promote Martin to a manager  position in the research group, so you will need to nominate him for  promotion at the PRC meeting for us.  Martin has spent the last four months supporting EBS.   His primary project  has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of  the media-cast product running on the EBS network.   This type of analysis is  critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in  trying to service, for example, the Blockbuster deal.   Martin has already  come  up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive  contractor from Lucent who is under contract to support this modelling  effor.   Prior to supporting EBS, Martin used his engineering skills (B.S.  Caltech, Ph.D. U.of Texas in EE) to create models of regional power  transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion  constraints.    In our internal pre-ranking meeting we felt that Martin was deserving of a  rating of Superior due to his technical excellence, his excellent attitude  and work ethic, and his ability to move projects forward with minimal  supervision.  Regards,  Stinson 
kaminski-v	 Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate  summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking  about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of  developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can  potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to  risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers)  because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed  for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such  differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be  moved up a notch in the case of EBS.  Ravi.

We can still work on the article but he needs something to begin the editing process.  Second, in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a roundtable discussion involving Sheridan titman, John McCormack (Stern stewart), Ron Erd (Southern Energy), Jeff Sandifer (president of sandifer capital--$700 million undermanagement), and Gene Humphries.  Attached you will find a section THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT, but that I thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the course of writing this paper.

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th  to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband  (technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to  meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.  Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly  stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.  I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at  the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to  New York.  Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the  students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?   Please let me know!  Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested  in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.  Thanks Vince!

farmer-d	 Please find attached the On-Call Notes for the weekend of 3/10 & 11/01.  Bob    
farmer-d	 FYI -   We are having some "after-the-fact" balancing issues with King Ranch.  I just  spoke with Carol regarding our net position with the plant, she has informed  me that the Saxet Canales production we are buying at the inlet has been  averaging approximately 3,850 Dth/day for January, and has been producing at  or around that level since November.  We don't have eyes at the meter,  however, Carol was brought online this past week, and I will be receiving  production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries.  We have been scheduling 838 to 1,045 Dth/day at the meter.  We need to gross  up for Jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do  not create additional balancing issues with the plant.  Please let me know if you have any further questions, or need additional  information.  Mary

beck-s	 Mr. Hall, I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the  following questions:  1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM  and they show no p&l for the year   Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums  and commodity prices?  2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a  simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).   Where does this show up?  3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed  in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various Enron entities   that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be? And if so, who is  deciding not to include? Pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do. Thanks Ted

kaminski-v	 Vince, Sorry for getting back a little late. I have been in touch with Kirstee to  figure out how to treat positions data which is the primary cause for  fluctuations. Apparently, as of 7/19, MG still has July position. This may be  spot or balance of the month, or some settlement issue. This indeed is what  we are trying to find out/verify (it may be an error too). Kirstee is going  to get back to me on this. If it is not an error, then Anjam's latest results  ($5.5 million total VAR) are reasonable given all the assumptions and the  missing pieces. I will keep you posted.

beck-s	 Thanks for your note Sally that is very helpful . I think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and  efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit . I  would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can  put the situation in context , so that they know our concerns in addition to  any they may have . It is also important to be clear as to what has already  been identified and is being addressed and how . While I understand that part  of the idea of doorstep is to " rattle the cages " of the commercial  management , it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it  was in this case .  John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is  discussed in Houston - unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise . I  take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to  insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does  lead to some delay , on occasion , while facts are being gathered . What I  would also like , in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of  the review , is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly ,  both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing . There  is always a question of prioritisation of resource , particularly in  businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge ( going forward you  will have similar issues on Steel etc ) and I would like the doorstep team to  provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also  to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful  .  I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan , but I  would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication  happens in the future . Thanks Michael

kaminski-v	 Ehud,  Sorry I shall miss you on Thursday.  I shall definitely attend you presentation at Power 2000.  I shall ask about a guest accounton EOL. Typically, such an account allows an outside user to take a look at the system, but I don't think the traders  will allow systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third  party.

Presentation of My  Risk-Management Optimization Model; 3. Enron On-Line   Vince,  Greetings.  I am following up at this time with respect to the above issues we discussed in San Antonio.  1.  I am leaving Thur. morn for Philadelphia, and shall not be back until late Fri.  (My ETD is 9:40 a.m., which I understand is less than an hour before your arrival ...)  Thus I shall regrettably miss your current UT visit, which we had hoped to also use as an opportunity to present/discuss my enterprise-wide risk management model.  2.  That said, I shall be presenting an abridged version of this model at Power 2000's first day, 5/9 4:15 - 4:55 p.m.  While I realize you'll be very busy over Power 2000's two days, should your schedule permit, I should most welcome the opportunity for you to see the model.  3.  Per your suggestion in San Antonio, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire whether I might obtain an Enron On-Line account to obtain electricity prices quoted by Enron.  I look forward to seeing you at Power 2000.  Best Regards, Ehud  ==============================================      Ehud I.

kaminski-v	 Molly,  Giuseppe is finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford and worked for us last summer.   We would like to make him an offer to bring him as a manager.   Vince would like to offer $110 k base plus a $20k signing bonus and whatever would be the appropriate relocation package (He is single.).     He is leaving on Monday for Europe, so it would be preferable if we can get an offer letter in his hands by Friday or Saturday.    I have verbally given him this offer already, but told him that you would be the expert regarding what is covered in the relocation part.    He should be sending me his current address by email which I will forward to you a.s.a.p.  thanks,  Stinson x34748  P.S.   Regarding Jinbaek.

kaminski-v	 Hi guys!  As most of you know by now today is my last day at Enron North America. It  has been really great few months and Maureen has most graciously put up with  my school and exam schedule. As today is also my graduation from the  University of Houston, I don't have any formal reasons to remain in Houston  and will be heading to the misty Albion to work for Enron Europe as soon as  my work permit for the UK is ready. The latter is still a mystery but is  anticipated some time in early February. Right now I am planning to come back  to Houston middle of January to wait for the work permit and sell my car,  some furniture, etc. (stay tuned for great deals :-) So, I will be back to  see you guys. If you miss me too much try to find consolation in Miss Yana  Kristal, a U of H student of Slavic origin, who will be taking over my  responsibilities starting early January. I know I will miss you and am  planning to sneak in the video conferencing room during the Thursday  meetings. I know it won't be the same, but it's better than nothing. Or you  can start planning that trip to London...  Below are the numbers where if you can't reach me there will be information  where I might be.  Phone numbers: Houston: 713-213-7733 - cell & voicemail Sofia: (011) +359 2 74 73 06 - home (+8 hours from Houston)  E-mail: marty@myself.com  Travel schedule: Leave Houston and go to Sofia December 21; Come back to Houston January 15 (depending on how the work permit is coming ).  Have very, very Happy Holidays and a great Millenium!  Martina

As you know we will be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to bring our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are working with Duke, and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

kaminski-v	 Dear Vince,  I hope you are well and that things round at Enron aren't too hectic. It is my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the second Industry Briefing - "Learning from US experience: Lessons to be learned from the restructuring North American markets". I appreciate that you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can provide you with another reason to cross the globe.  Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference before breaking into their streams.  Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk management and the latest business issues.  This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let me know; any help would be gratefully received.  This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.  I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.  Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our three major annual events on three different continents!  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Yours sincerely,  Joel Hanley Producer, EPRM Conferences & Courses   - AustralianEnergy2000.doc   __________________ EPRM Conferences Risk Publications Hong Kong Tel: 852 2545 2710 Fax: 852 2545 7317 www.riskpublications.com 
kaminski-v	 Naveen and Matthew, I started looking systematically through UK positions and corresponding VAR  numbers in the RisckRac. I found a few inconsistencies so far.  1. The portfolio E1SB1-NBP has a book E1SB1 under it.  The sum of delta  positions for this book is  239,021,655, the sum of gamma positions is -211,031,450. VAR for the  portfolio E1SB1-NBP is zero.  The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example E1SB2-NBP, E1SB3-NBP,  E2XX1-NBP.  2. The portfolio E1SBP1-PPP also has the book E1SB1 under it. This book  contains the positions on PPPWD1 through PPPWD6 and PPPWE1 through PPPWE4.   The same refers to the other books, for example E1SB2.  This looks messy.  Can someone in RAC go over all the portfolios, all the  corresponding books and curves in RisktRac and make sure they are set up properly?  Thank you,  Tanya.

beck-s	 Steve, I am still a little out of it from my travels, but let me take a first shot  at my reaction to this:  I think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark-to-market  exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed.  Generally, time is of the essence  in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into  account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical  times.    I think that RAC should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy  and be part of any decisions made. I will add to this if and when the haze clears up.

kaminski-v	 Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at  pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:  ISO New England and PJM Interconnection Propose a Standard Market Design for Wholesale Electricity Markets  March 29, 2001 - HOLYOKE, MA -  Two of the country's leading wholesale electricity market administrators, ISO New England Inc. and PJM  Interconnection, L.L.C., together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation, a systems developer for  electric utilities, today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets, but will lead, they believe, to  the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country.  Today, ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design.  The combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale electricity markets ("Standard Market Design").  ISO New England, ALSTOM ESCA and PJM, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PJM Technologies Inc., have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing PJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM.  The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch.  "This new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a customized market system for New England," said William W. Berry, Chairman and Acting CEO of ISO New England.  "Now is the time to stop the experimentation. Ultimately, we hope the Standard Market Design will serve as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country, if not around the  world."   "PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive  wholesale electricity market," said Phillip G. Harris, Chairman and CEO of PJM. "Along with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept, this  initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design."  This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers  across different markets and promote FERC's goal of creating a seamless marketplace. "We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issues of mutual importance," stated Mr. Berry.  "This new market design, together with our efforts to address the market "seams" and other coordination issues, will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer together."  ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January 16, 2001.  "Because of our geographic location, New York is in the center of the  Northeast markets, with ISO New England, PJM and IMO each on one of our borders.  We support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeast trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit," said William J. Museler, President and CEO of the New York Independent System Operator. "The New York ISO will continue to work with our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger regional markets."  This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with  stakeholder input. ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design to the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New England Power Pool in a series of meetings next week.  Additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks. The Standard Market Design for New England will be subject to FERC approval.  "Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a market's efficiency.  A market that moderates price fluctuations and  encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market -- and  efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity," said Alain Steven, CEO of ALSTOM ESCA.  "In the future, this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets."  ISO New England Inc. is the not-for-profit corporation responsible for the day-to-day reliable operation of New England's bulk generation and  transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26,000 megawatts.  In addition to operating the bulk power grid, ISO New England is the administrator of the region's wholesale electricity marketplace and the Open Access Transmission Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool. ISO New England is based in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., is an Independent System Operator, administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJM Energy Markets and Capacity Markets. PJM currently administers the largest wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than  200. It is headquartered in Norristown, Pennsylvania. PJM Technologies, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., designed to respond to market opportunities by bringing cost-effective, reliable solutions to the energy marketplace. It was created to commercialize PJM's knowledge capital, experience, and proven success in electric energy markets, system operations, and applications development.   # # #  For more information about the New York ISO, please call: Steve Sullivan, Director of Communications, 518-356-7605.

beck-s	 Everyone should be using Enron Net Works LLC in Sally's group from 1.1.2001.  Thanks     Nicki Daw@ENRON 01/22/2001 10:51 AM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Business Cards  Louise,  I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year!  I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of  some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with  they organisation names e.g. Enron North America or Enron South America,  rather than Enron Americas/Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody  to use Enron Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their  business unit names ENA, EGM, EIM?  See you soon.  Nicki  P.S.  Mark gave me a voucher for Urban Retreat for Christmas, which I am very  pleased with.  Sue's jealous, she got crystal!  
beck-s	 This is probably way more information than you want, but just in case you  want to see where we are on the audit comments, attached is a worksheet I am  updating every few weeks to ensure we address all their issues asap.  They  will (at the request of Louise) be conducting a follow up audit in October,  and "re-audit" the management report in mid-July.    Sheri 
beck-s	 Please plan to attend a  reception and dinner for those Analysts and  Associates due to rotate in the near future who have made significant  contributions to Enron North America  The function will be hosted by the  Office of the Chairman at Cafe Annie located at 1728 Post Oak Blvd. on August  2,  2000.  The reception will start at 7:00pm with dinner to follow at  7:45pm.  Please RSVP to Ted Bland at ext. 3-5275 no later than close of  business Monday, July 31.  This will be an informal gathering to discuss the  progress of ENA and an open forum to interact with the management team on a  one on one basis.    See you on Wednesday.    Mark, Dave and John 
farmer-d	 We will soon be migrating to Windows 2000 and Outlook.  The Texas Desk is  scheduled for Tuesday, April 10th.  I was told to pass along the following  information to my group:  1.  You will be receiving emails from the migration team ("GEM") - please be  sure to only open this from your own desktop, and not remotely.  This is very  important.  These messages will be explaining the migration process and what  you need to do to insure a successful migration.  2.  Due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are advised to clean  your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE migration.  With Outlook,  you will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  Outlook will issue a  warning once you reach 75 MB to let you know that you are near your Mailbox  Limit.  Once you reach 100 MB, you will be prevented from sending email, but  you will still be able to receive internal and external messages  You will  then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail, saving  attachments to a local drive, etc. before you will be able to send an email  again.  3.  From the day of migration, only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from  your mailbox.  This includes mail in your inbox and other folders.  Calendar  items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated.  4.  Everyone will have a read only view of Notes until the transition is  completed.  You will be able to copy/paste.  Thanks, Laura 
farmer-d	 This is a note to update you guys on the progress I'm making concerning  cleaning-up and combining well-head deals...  So far, I have completed:  EOG: Deal 126358 reflects 0 volumes on meter 6067 March 2000 forward Deal 126281 reflects volumes on meter 6296 as well as volumes moved from  sitara deal 126358; all volumes are at meter 6296  Forest: Deal 132832 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward Deal 139397 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 6396  Suemaur: Deal 138658 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward Deal 138658 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 9766   A similar effort will be made for: Saxet (deals 154608/138546); Comstock  (deals 125827/125828/125899); and Costilla (deals 125783/125900)  O'Neal 3-9686 
farmer-d	 We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is  45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a  problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up  with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1  only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I  think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the  purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73  booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be  able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can  see the numbers.       Megan 
farmer-d	 Deal # 547201  Texas General Land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a  part of the month exchange deal for transport.   Do we have the name of the trader at Texas General Land Office that did this  deal with us ?  The sale was for 01/01-01/31 for 99,200 mmbtus at $9.82.  Thanks - Katherine 
kaminski-v	 Good morning Ainsley:  A copy of your resume was forwarded to Vince Kaminski and the Research  Group of Enron Corp.   They are very interested in talking with you about the  possibility of a summer internship with the Research Group.    Please let us know if you would be interested and we will arrange either a telephone interview or bring you into the office  for an interview.     You may contact me at:  Shirley Crenshaw Administrative Coordinator Enron Corp. Research Telephone:  713/853-5290 email:  Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com  Look forward to hearing from you Ainsley.  Sincerely,  Shirley Crenshaw 
farmer-d	 During mid-july, SITARA will change the logic on Desk to Desk deals to post  the volume associated with the Sales (Seller) side to the SITARA deal.   Currently, the volume on the Receipt (Buyer) side is being posted.  This  change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently  being used in SAP.  This change should help to avoid Intercompany imbalances.  Please be aware that this change will effect Desk to Desk deals only.  The  logic on Transport Usage deals will remain as it is currently - Delivery  Point (To) - posts to the SITARA deal.  If you have any questions, please give me a call at X39222.  Chao!

How is Wednesday at 2:30?  I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman, Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk about a shotgun marriage!  If we have time next week, I could step you through our website -- www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).  Have a great weekend.

I think somebody from Resco (or  Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.   Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as  well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this  month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they  would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know  if anybody in Resco may have any interest.  Thanks,  Steve  PS:  Vince, simply an FYI since they do focus on modelling and research.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven R Meyers/HOU/EES on 04/11/2000  08:14 AM ---------------------------   Bradley Davids <Brad.Davids@abacus-direct.com> on 04/10/2000 08:35:32 PM To: "'Steven.R.Meyers@enron.com'" <Steven.R.Meyers@enron.com> cc:   Subject: RE: Possible Meeting?   Steve:  I'll see if I can get in on the 25th . . . will let you know, but I think it'll work.  Just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested, Abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world (89 million US households, 3 billion+ purchases), along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level. Given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is--improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)  Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and "new entrants" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we have some tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs.  I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, but I guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enron might have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly) listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.  Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Your note looks good to me, short and to the point.    I assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with Dale.  I would  want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model  AND database for North America.  Unless a familiarity with the short term  model is a prerequisite, I doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on  it.  Depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term  model, it might be helpful to have access in both Omaha and Houston?  We would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need  for testing the model.  Steve Hotte, CIO for ETS, would co-ordinate the  in-house installation for us.  At some point, it will be helpful to get Steve  in contact with the appropriate MarketPoint IT rep.  Assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues, Dale should  probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review.   Let me know what I should do next.  JNG

farmer-d	 Nick, I am not sure what happened to this volume.   I cannot tell by the audit  trail, but there is a connection between meter HPL meter 987283,  and MIDT  989807.   The volume you are referring to is on Mid-Tex Pipeline under meter  989807.   It it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference.   I do  not think this is correct because the deal you reference show HPLC as  purchaser.   The volume is in MIPS under meter 989807, but  the supply deal  is set up on HPL meter 987283, and the audit trail in Sitara shows the deal  was moved from MIDT to HPL.   Get with Thu when she returns to see if she  knows anything about this.

Additionally, because of the time difference between the two targets and the  fact that Risk Managament do not obtain MTM information until completion of  the overnight batch ( ie start working first thing in morning UK time ) there  has been scope for continuing to work on the raw MTM data. Consequently, there is potential for Risk Management 'top siding' for corrections such that  the summary DPR will be 'different' from the risktrac information - We do  topsides because it is impossible, given current systems, to rerun the  overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems - our p&l  explain processes are themselves spreadsheet based. The majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal  entry stage - itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation  process of risk systems Whilst the topside adjustment is communicated to Houston  - Risktrac requires  a fully automated process Whilst we should consider the materiality of the topside - RAC rightly are  trying to implement zero tolerance - to help flag all the issues Within the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on UK Power  such that the full database was incorrectly valued - there was insufficient  time ( for reason stated above ) to rerun and reextract and indeed today the  batch failed because the UK Power server ran out of processing diskspace.  We are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies  we face ( and that have been flagged on a continuous basis - they are on the  long list for development ).  The recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of  the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues - and we  should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy  compliance ( we should recommunicate the policy internally within Europe )

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

farmer-d	  To path a buyback {MOP; Supply List}  with an existing Market Deal  {typically baseload} please follow these steps:     Theory # 1:   Example; Supply Deal = 5.0/d  & Market Deal = 5.0/d     1.) Attach the Supply Deal with the Market Deal to establish a "buy/sell"   path list contract  oppose to a transport contract.    2.) Path the transaction on the "buy/sell" { or broker the deal}  contract.     3.) This process is applicable only if the Supply Deal and the Market Deal  are the same quantity.     4.) This example will yield a net zero activity in POP.     Theory # 2:  Example ;   Supply Deal = 7.0/d  &  Market Deal = 10.0/d     1)  Follow  steps 1 & 2 in Theory # 1.     2.) Additionally, create a service transportation contract {i.e. K-215}  in  the path list.     2.) Path 7.0 on the "buy/sell" path list contract and  10.0  on the  transport {i.e. K-215} contract.     This procedure will eliminate  an out-of-balance in MOP for both the "Supply  Deal and the Market Deal"  and send 3.0  to POP via x-port K-215.    Note:  Never path a buyback {Supply Deal}  using a receipt transport contact  and the{ Market Deal}  using  a  delivery transport contract.      POP's should only  reflect  the "net" on these two transactions {buyback  and baseload deal}.    
farmer-d	 Darren: I have a price issue with MGI Supply for January 2001.  For deal 551414, we have tiered pricing for days 13-16.  The first 20,000 at $8.71 and everything over at Agua Dulce GDP + $0.01.  MGI has the deal priced at the GDP + $0.01 only.  They do not have the $8.71.  Should this pricing be tiered?  MGI would owe us $10,600.00 if we go with their pricing.  Megan

beck-s	 Certainly understand the tradition you have with OU/Texas and it would be hard. I imagine David is starting to feel a little cocky, given we should be undefeated going into Texas, but he may still need to seek the shelter of the study, as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead.  Sounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would only get in the way. I'm sure David will not let the fire die, if she is truly interested in OU. FYI, OU's Spring Break is March 17-25 next year. So you can plan accordingly. Let me know if you decide when you decide to come up and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour. Also, I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades. I know that OU requires a 24 on the ACT, or finish in the top 1/3 of your graduating class. It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to 26 or top 30% of graduating class. Looks like OU is following UT on tightening entrance requirements.  I can get you shirts caps, sweatshirts, etc. for OU, UT and Tech. You can go to Bigtimesports.com and look at the styles. I think they are also in the school colors. If you see a style you like, let me know the size shape and school and I can order it. If some of it is for you, let me know, as they have different styles for women. Also, I can have logo's etc. reduced (like I did on your Bevo on your shirt) so they are not so big. I always have them reduce the OU from 1 3/4" to a 1 1/4" size, so I don't look like a "poster boy" for OU. Anyway, let me know and I will order them for you.  Let me know when you hear back from Lexi about your discussion relative to summer internship recruiting.    Ted K.

With the ages of the kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party!)  We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan.  We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you have a list of what is available for those schools?

I hope Enron will be able to look at some students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.  As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5 together or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them. Might be able to trade up or something.  Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for you.  Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part of the OU recruiting effort.

As always, I appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards. I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have done a great job in changing and promoting the program.  I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a change in our strategy!  If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold.  On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know -- we can probably place a few orders through you!

farmer-d	 Please note that I have re-formatted the attachment to an excel spreadsheet. Try the attachment and let me know if you have any problems.  Also, in discussion with Duke, TXU Fuel Co. does not have a transportation agreement  with Duke for the redelivery of this gas.  The agreement is between Enron and Duke. According to Brian Kerns of Duke, they basically took assignment of the  existing transportation agreement Enron had with PG&E (now El Paso).  If this is the case, then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards  meeting our monthly minimum purchase obligation.  Any imbalance between Enron and Duke on the Duke system receipts would be transparent to TXU and worked out between Enron and Duke.  Any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual volumes received at the "Teco Tap" would need to be worked out between Enron  and TXU Fuel Co.  There are a couple of different ways to work this out, but I  need to review the contract first.  Please look at this on your side and lets come  to an agreement as soon as possible since the end of the month is quickly approaching.

kaminski-v	 Hello Vince and John,  I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus.  We can  tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.  I  believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest  shown at the Career Fair).  These tend to be fairly informal.  I was thinking  that we could present in this order:  Vince  Gives the Enron overview presentation  (30 minutes) John  Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes)  Ashley  Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)  Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you  feel comfortable with the layout and content.  I am meeting with John today  at 1:30 - Vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that  would be great.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 3-3589 Thanks, Ashley Vince, here is a copy of the current Enron overview presentation.  There are  also speaker notes that go into great detail.    John, here is a copy of the current technology presentation for Carnegie  Mellon.  The only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end.  There  are also speaker notes that go into greater detail.  --->

Stacey has already bought gas from Duke to resupply (the  difference 4.480) Midlothian at Duke Pegasus, in addition to the 8.600  incremental she bought there.  So for the weekend, we should have a sale to  Midlothian of 13,080 at Pegasus.  ---Mark x33396

kaminski-v	 Comments:  1.  In the sentence between eqn. 3 and eqn. 4,  I think "annualized  volatility"  should replace "annualized standard deviation."  2.  As to the comment,  "Immediately we see something quite  counter-intuitive."    I would disagree.   I think that its quite intuitive  that this model should get closer to the Black-Scholes price as what is  defined as the "jump" component becomes just part of the main price  distribution, which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1-sigma  event.    The table does show, however, that the results of using this model  are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a "jump" (i.e. 2-sigma  or 3-sigma... events),  and this is one difficulty in using the model in  practice.  3.  In the paragraph after the table, I don't understand the argument about  hedging the option.  Especially about buying a swap which would pay on the  difference between the strike and Fs.   This seems non-sensical.  4.  I could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article, so  this point should probably be explained more clearly.   --Stinson       Vince J Kaminski 08/18/2000 08:15 AM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex  Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Alex's paper  Minor changes I made to Alex's paper.

We think it would  be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to  gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly  employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to  Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she  could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that  might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely  efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to  begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.  I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30  Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources,  it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration  sets with a likely return visit to London as required.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Cheers, Scott

Marc Brammer Director of Strategic Sales tel:  800.523.2627, x5706 mbrammer@MoodysRMS.com  2. Neal Clark Vice President Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701 nclark@MoodysRMS.com   Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their  quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or  not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.   Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between  Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London.

Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the  RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell)  and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model  may have.  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model  extends to other countries.  I know from a previous conversation with Lea  Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American  names but they suspect it might extend to other countries.  Conversely, I  know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to  develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions.  One  they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe.  Data, as  always, was the issue.  See if the quants have any perspective on their  success/plan in that area.  Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward  pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be  able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

What do you mean by "buying blind  all major data associated with these  specific DUNS numbers"?   I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know  RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work  for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte  that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.

After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.  Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS  cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could  greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major  data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.  Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without  resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for  completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of  which fields, etc.).  Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we  need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We  would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal  buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly  increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size,  etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.   Any thoughts.    Mike

farmer-d	 TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits  You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC)  concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate  their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication  also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network  due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.  It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40%  increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to  you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter  proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.  While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC,  Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation  efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it  is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group  and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.    Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals  within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those  with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake  Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our  affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO  options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between  September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial  Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network  benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other  charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be  pre-certified with UHC.  These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary  Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.  If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's  customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases  the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to  UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained  by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).  Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to  consider your elections for 2001.    United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees  through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that  may impact you or your family. 
kaminski-v	 Vince/Stinson,  Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as  well as the revised statement that can be made to press.  The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of  the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the  gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating  in homes, and commercial establishments.  Hope ths helps.

kaminski-v	 Tentative agenda for the Research Lunch meeting on Wednesday, August 2nd at  11:30 am:  Objective: Develop a methodology and a model for estimating risks of the EES  Regulatory portfolio.  Discussion Items:  1. Elements of the Regulatory portfolio   - Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Positions  - Bundled Tariffs (full utility tariffs that are in place prior to  deregulation)  - Competitive Transition Charges (CTC) Positions  - Diversification between the three risk elements  2. Risk drivers in each bucket (Scott Stoness of EES to provide more detail)   - T&D: interest rates  - Bundled Tariffs: regulatory decisions, power prices, interest rates,  inflation  - CTC: power prices, fuel prices, generation valuation, generation stack,  regulatory decisions  3. Position aggregation parameters (Scott Stoness of EES to provide  suggestions)   - by NERC Region  - by state  - by utility  - by utility tariff  4. Model environment   - Excel  - GRMS/RisktRAC  - Other  5. VaR Parameters   - correlations  - factor loadings (1-factor model?)  - other  6. EES specific issues   - The size of CTC positions is impacted by the roll-off date, which is  subject to change due to a number of factors (jump diffusion?)  - T&D and Bundled Tariffs do not move daily, but rather once every 2-3 years  (event driven?)  Thanks, Vlady.  PS: Shirley, could you please make the lunch arrangements accordingly. 
kaminski-v	 Dear Dr. Kaminski  here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow  Dr. V. Kaminski Enron P.O. Box 1188 Houston, Texas 77251-1188  Dear Dr. Kaminski  March 12, 2001      I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.  The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April 27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel arrangements on this end if so desired.  We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary equipment for your presentation.  We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.    Sincerely   W. Fitzgibbon

kaminski-v	 Hi,  Just like to say that it has been great meeting and working with you all.  I  will be leaving Enron effective July 5th  to do investment banking in Hong  Kong.   I will initially be based in New York and will be moving to Hong Kong  after a few months.  Do contact me when you are in the vicinity.  I don't  know my contact details yet and would let you know once I get it.   In the  meantime, I will always be checking my e-mail at royibasco@yahoo.com.  Please  let me know what your e-mail addresses are and keep in touch!  Best regards,  Roy 
kaminski-v	 Vince, thanks for your very prompt email response. I passed your message  along to Dave.  Thanks also for a great dinner and day of meetings last week. I really  enjoyed the chance to learn more about Enron, and was very impressed with  everyone I met.  Look forward to working with you these next few months!!

kaminski-v	 Hello from Texas,  We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run  into a snag.  We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in  April (as last year).  However, we can get the hotel and make all our "fun"  arrangements for the second weekend in April.  However, this is Easter  weekend.  The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower  because it's a holiday.  However, we are concerned that holding the meeting  on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that  some or many of you may not be able to attend.    My related question to you is this:  Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose  a problem for you?  Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you  may not be able to attend this year's conference.  We need your opinion to  guide our decision.  Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!  John   p.s.  We are very fortunate to have Enron return as our corporate sponsor  again this year.   John D. Martin Carr P.

beck-s	 The companies that are our primary competition in this area are the Big 5  accounting firms.  They interview in May of a 5 year PPA's 3rd year for a  Spring Internship in the 4th year.  We must attract 4th year PPAs in the fall  before their spring internship or 3rd year PPAs in the spring.  We need to do  alot more planning on this between now and next fall but I definitely want to  interview for interns both in the spring and fall.  Thanks

kaminski-v	 Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and  methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group  in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.    With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price  environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will  political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.    Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North  American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain  higher than the rest of the world.  Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most  helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of  your group as soon as convenient.  Thanks, sorry we missed you today.  JNG    
farmer-d	 Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about  this?  I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and  running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in  Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so  small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let  this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???  I welcome your thoughts. Victor        
beck-s	 Sally  Hello again, and how are you?  I guess you are still as busy as described below, but I hope you got some  time out from your Friday concept, and have had some time to think about  Japan. FYI, on Wednesday I will have a confrence call with Brent Price to  talk about EGM and Japan, from a Commercial Support perspective.   FYI, I am up in Oslo this week signing off Enron Nordic Energy, and are  comming to San Antonio next week for this accounting offsite, where I guess I  will see you? Any news on the offsite you were planning in October with Mike?  I look forward to hear from you.  Regards Jan-Erland    To: Jan-Erland Bekeng/AP/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Re: Enron Japan Commercial Support Model    Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office  in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought  processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations  personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.   While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good  option.    I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After  several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a  practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no  meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your  document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a  note then if there are any other comments that I have.    I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while  you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some  concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my  schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the  calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he  is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person  sometime in the not too distant future.    Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business  controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a  location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential  dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a  long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join  us.

kaminski-v	 John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree. It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not  have good answers.     Vince

kaminski-v	 Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked  earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is  optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.  Best, Alex

beck-s	 Thanks for your note.  With the increased focus on our middle office products  and the possible outsourcing of those, I am in very stong agreement that all  groups need to start documenting their processes and procedures and believe  it falls under my responsibility to ensure they do so.   I would be very interested in knowing a bit more about SCOR as any tools - I  just received the package you sent me. I'll look it over and get back to you  on how I intend to approach this.  Thanks       HEIDI MASON@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/11/2001 07:06 PM To: Shona Wilson@Enron cc: sally.beck@enron.com   Subject: Your Input please  Shona  Sent a message to Sally earlier this week that I realised afterwards would  have been best directed to you in the first instance. Apologies for that.  I was and still am, seeking input on the whole issue of the level of written  control procedures we should have and the best way to achieve that. When I  first started here I was a little surprised at the lack of written  procedures. While I believe the actual control structure is good, there is  very little in writing, even in the most generic form. In discussing this  with Paul Quilkey, he noted that policy, at least when he was in Houston, was  to deliberately minimise the written procedures to prevent it being too  transportable.  The reason for my query is that I last week looked at SCOR, a control review  process marketed by the Aust Financial Markets Association. It is a risk  control review process which allows you to benchmark your processes and which  provide detailed documentation which can be personalised to your business, to  create controls review. It is very detailed and has been subscribed to by  most of our competitors in the energy market.   I am interested in subscribing, it we want/need detailed review notes,  however in light of PQ's comments I wanted your feed back on exactly what is  required/desirable to have for each site.   With thanks  Heidi

kaminski-v	 Vince,   I was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to Jeff Shankman  about, in the Dabhol LNG context.  It occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges, and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways.  Some time back, I had looked into the possiblility of transporting LNG by  train.  Apparently, technology exists wherein LNG can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies.  I believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with LNG by developing just such a market in India for Commercial customers.  It is pertinent to note that the Konkan Rail line is just about 1 hr. 45  minutes from the Dabhol plant.  Trucks from Dabhol could carry LNG to the  rail line at Guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  India.  If we target end-consumers directly, we could easily sell at retail  type prices, and build in a large margin, even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller.  (The alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced, and mostly trucked along  roads,increasing costs).  The end aim is to keep income targets in India, so  that the Analysts do not have a field day with the stock.  Hence keeping activity up in India, and showing that solutions exist, will  keep stock price buoyed.  We could explore this idea if it appeals!  Regards, Sandeep.

The generic forms that were presented at the  PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and  to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely  appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical  areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time  permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the  organization.    One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting   evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance,  another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to  the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would  welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about  this.           Many Thanks,  Gina Corteselli  Global Performance Management 713 853-3377 713 569-5589 (mobile)   
kaminski-v	 Hello all:  Along with the inception of the New SAP time keeping, we also have new expense account forms.  They will no longer use your social security number as the id on your  expense accounts,  they want you to use your new employee # that was sent to you by email to access HRonline.  In order for Anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports, we will need your new employee #.   Please send this number to me as soon as possible.  Thanks!  Shirley

kaminski-v	 David,  Here are the reviews of the UT Energy Finance program that  you requested:   From Jennifer Martinez  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of=20 1998):  The Energy Finance Program 2 years ago was very good, especially considerin= g=20 it was the first year of the program.  There were a lot of guest speakers= =20 from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou= t=20 the energy industry through case studies, lectures, etc.  Basically, we=20 learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance= =20 classes, but all the cases and examples were energy-related.  The professor= s=20 were good for the most part but didn't have a great deal of practical=20 industry experience.  If I had to guess the reason for decreased=20 participation in the program, I would probably say it is the professors. = =20 Ronn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and=20 quantitative.  Some students prefer less technical professors and classes= =20 that aren't limiting to the energy industry.  Also, the fact that the class= =20 meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing.  Other than those= =20 things, I can't imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment.  I=20 especially don't understand why every single person didn't drop for Enron. =  I=20 wonder if it has something to do with international status.???=20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -----------------------------------------------------------------  From John Massey  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):  Bottom Line -  UT Business Schools is great - Investment Fund - Best Activity available to= =20 students Energy Finance program - Fairly Weak - It was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a= =20 weak finance appendage - The Finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher, ignorant about=20 industry specific analysis, devoid of industry experience, rude to outside= =20 lectures (from industry) Keith Brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small= =20 portion of the class time -  Way to make Better: Get teachers with practical industry experience - Make it a seminar Class - Focus on Case studies, lectures - given by people= =20 from industry - Promote the class within the business school - I felt like UT did a poor jo= b=20 of internally (to students) promoting the class -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -----------  From Ross Mesquita  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):  To be honest, a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific.  = =20 When energy applications were presented, it seemed more like general financ= e=20 questions were reworded to include energy lingo.  We had some very good=20 speakers, but for the most part, I did not feel like the 6 hours of class h= ad=20 enough energy focus.  I assumed that this would get better as the program= =20 progressed.  One reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy=20 Finance is a very specific focus.  I would have probably not enrolled in th= e=20 Energy Finance program had it been available in my first year.  I did not= =20 know enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20 consider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20 finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n= ot=20 want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20  Here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--  My interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. = =20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ----------  From Billy Braddock   (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998= ):  I was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of= =20 1998.  The primary positives to the class revolved around outside=20 panels/instruction.  For example, Enron sent representatives on 2 separate= =20 occasions to discuss particular topics (Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson).=  =20 Other notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant= =20 and E&P professional), the Beacon Group, and Encap Investments.  Another go= od=20 speaker was a professor from UT's school of engineering.  He brought a good= =20 perspective as to the "basics" of the energy business.  The class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20 professors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors= =20 had any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2= =20 were research focussed/tenured with little credibility in "teaching."  One = of=20 the professors primary focus of research was fixed income, while the other = 2=20 were investments and corporate finance, respectively. =20  As is the case for UT's finance program in general, and energy finance in= =20 particular, UT is in dire need of teaching professors (as opposed to resear= ch=20 professors) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples= =20 and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a= =20 finance background.  Particular to the energy program, UT needs to have mor= e=20 instruction from energy professionals (such as the instructors used for=20 Enron's internal learning programs (ie. Derivatives classes, etc.).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -----------------------  From Bryan Williams  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998)= :  I participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of 1998, a= t=20 the University of Texas. =20  The curriculum was understandably =01&rough around the edges=018 as 1998 wa= s the=20 first year the Energy Finance course was offered.  However, the instruction= =20 also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak= =20 of (The 6-credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors).= =20  Two of the three professors have co-authored textbooks, and the third=20 professor=01,s claim to fame is fixed income.  As a group, the three profes= sors=20 are research-heavy (as opposed to industry focused), and the team-teaching= =20 format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for= =20 the success of the class. =20  That said, the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside= =20 speakers.  Among them: Vince=20 Kaminski & Gary Hickerson, both of Enron.  They also dedicated one class=20 period to a video conference call with the Beacon Group, an energy consulti= ng=20 group that I believe was recently acquired by Goldman. Jeff Sandefer, an independent businessman, an entreprenuership instructor,= =20 and one of the foremost experts in the E&P sector, also spoke to the class.=  =20 Jeff was joined by some of the executives from Houston-based Encap.  The woes of the Energy Finance could be easily remedied by injecting some= =20 instruction from someone from industry.    The class is too=20 academic/theoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener= gy=20 sector.=20  The instructors Enron uses for the Derivatives courses taught internally ar= e=20 good examples of people who can package very relevant information and=20 successfully articulate it in a couple of days.  Perhaps a similar approach= =20 would bode well for the Energy Finance program at UT. =20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------- From Yuan Tian  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):  Here are my thoughts on the UT Energy Finance Program:  Pros: - more focused on the Finance studies in the Energy Industry which is right= =20 now in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus is=20 exposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries; - there are some experienced, brand-name professors (e.g. Sheridan Titman)= =20 teaching in the program;=20  Cons: - the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies= =20 such as Enron. Specifically, it might need to help students link to the=20 interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as Enron; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- From George Huan  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):  Companies expect MBA students to have both general management (new ideas) a= nd=20 analytic (quantative) skills.  Energy industry is no exception.  Energy Finance Program offers Financial Strategy and Risk Managements cours= es=20 which fit in the insudtry need.  However, these two courses are far from=20 enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation= =20 and excitements and opportunities in this industry.   Other management and= =20 quantitive courses are needed to complete this program.=20 My suggestions:  1) Seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies. Before= =20 students make their decisions, let them know:  What's happening and what's= =20 going to happen in this industry;  What the companies are doing now;  Who= =20 they are looking for. =20 2) Management and/or analytical courses should be included.  Such as:=20 Strategy, Financial enginering and Real Option. 3) More industry connections. Presentations and discussions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- --------------------------------  From Charlie Weldon (MBA Class of 2000, Energy Finance taken in fall of 199= 9)  My experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive=20 experience.  The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers=20 brought in during Dr. Titman's portion of the class.  This part of the cour= se=20 is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~10 case=20 classes all focusing on the Energy industry.  Two of the cases were based o= n=20 Enron, and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an= d=20 well thought out.  Value added by the professor was less than from the=20 speakers and cases.  The first eight  weeks of the course covered futures and options.  Nearly a= ll=20 of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy=20 industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student's=20 understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market.  The u= se=20 of options and futures for speculating and/or hedging was stressed on=20 numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power= =20 plant project.  I believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to=20 continuously make improvements to the program.  However, I do not believe= =20 that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to=20 improvement.   There is a strong need for more practical based training on= =20 energy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron. = =20 The focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical, due in large par= t=20 to their background.  While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi= ng=20 the basics, the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective= =20 bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course. =20  Until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive= =20 industry experience, I believe the Energy Finance program will continue to= =20 underdeliver on its objectives.  Additionally, I believe that the course=20 structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive= =20 hours of classroom instruction.

kaminski-v	 Clayton,  We can discuss your request  when I come back to the office on Monday.  Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an  explicit prior  permission from your boss, myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence. In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.   Vince

farmer-d	 Hello,  We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings  with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a  completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey  will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the  month of March.     NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time  directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you  can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can  add the appropriate activities to your survey.  To fill out the survey:  At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".   Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits. Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select  Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff,  specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on  information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed  that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that  corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of  activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity  listed in the column labelled "Hours". If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the  positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.   If you do not, the information will be lost.  We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two  specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month"  column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you  have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send  this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill  out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you  perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible  for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.  Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a  problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.  Thanks, Shari 3-3859 
farmer-d	 Daren,  I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on  the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we  have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few  days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85%  of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine  what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

farmer-d	  -----Original Message-----  From: Herrera, Ignacio  Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 9:54 AM  To: Abbott, Todd; Weygandt, Andrew; Glover, Rusty; Beard, Jaime;  Woodson, Todd; Ratzman, Eric; Eckermann, Derrek; Walker, Sam  Subject: FW: A&M and ESPN  For Immediate Release  June 26, 2001  ESPN TO LAUNCH SIDELINES NETWORK'S SECOND REALITY-BASED SERIES TO  PREMIERE WITH TEXAS A&M FOOTBALL  ESPN will launch a 13-episode, prime-time series this fall entitled  Sidelines, the network's second reality-based title under the ESPN  Original  Entertainment  (EOE) banner.  Sidelines will document the season of a  prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible,  less  celebrated people who are involved with the team.  The football Aggies  of  Texas A&M will be the focus of the series' premiere episodes to begin  October 5.  "Coach Slocum and I made the decision to be a part of this exciting  venture  with ESPN," Texas A&M Athletics Director Wally Groff said.  "We couldn't  be  more thrilled that ESPN has chosen Texas A&M for this series.  The  opportunity ESPN gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all  of  its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up."  In a "docu-drama" style, the various stories that surround the team will  be  explored through the voices and actions of people whose day-to-day lives  are  directly affected by living in the town and/or going to the school.  Players  and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral  fashion, but will not be the primary focus.  "This is a good opportunity for Texas A&M University and we're delighted  ESPN decided to feature the football program and some of the people  behind  the scenes," Head Coach R.C. Slocum said. "We look forward to working  with  them."  The participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who  reflect  every aspect of the University and College Station, Texas.  They will be  students, faculty, media, local storeowners, mothers, fathers and some  of  the high school seniors who aspire to attend the University.  "Each person has a role to play with the team, as well as a personal  story,"  said Mark Shapiro, vice president and general manager, ESPN Original  Entertainment.  "Sidelines will see each person grow in character as the  season progresses -- a kind of 'soap-umentary.' We'll weave the smaller  personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression  and  fate of the team and its season."  SIDELINES: TEXAS A&M STORYLINES  --This is the 125th anniversary of the school's founding (1876).  --The community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire  collapse  which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago.  A 90-year  tradition came to a tumultuous end.  Dealing with the loss and the  emotional  toll it took on faculty members, students and families will be an  important  part of this series.  The bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a  different form than has been tradition.  --Texas A&M, who lost a wild, snowy Independence Bowl last year in  overtime  to Mississippi State 43-41, will play Notre Dame (at home), Texas,  Oklahoma,  Kansas St and Colorado next year.  A tough schedule will provide for  great  drama.  --The school invented the phrase "12th Man" and actually owns the  trademark.  One game, the Aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and  stand  ready just in case he was needed. Ever since, a student is chosen for  every  home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team.  --Billy Pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities. He's been at  the  University for 36 years and was the student trainer for Bear Bryant's  A&M  team. He was actually in Junction, Texas for Bryant's infamous grueling  summer camp. The story of it was a best-selling book, The Junction Boys.  --At midnight on the Friday night before every home game, A&M students  gather at the stadium for what is called "Midnight Yell Practice;"  30,000  fans show up each week for this time-honored tradition.  EOE, the newest franchise of ESPN Programming, will develop a  wide-variety  of branded programming outside of the network's traditional event and  sports  news genres. Using a collection of vehicles -- game shows, documentaries  or  reality-based shows - it's ESPN's goal to broaden its audience by  appealing  to younger and casual sports fans.  In addition, the company is  exploring  new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all  platforms of the ESPN family - television, Internet, radio  -aTm-  
farmer-d	 Thanks for following up on this.  I think we're generally there in terms of the commercial terms, but need to  think through just a few issues related to our plans for the asset.

Our efforts  resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.   Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will  receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to  congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up  with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.  Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be  sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday,  March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who  did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:  "Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller  number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this  year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires  between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection  process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the  full-time associate program."  We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.  Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on  potential future Stanford recruiting events.  Regards, Celeste Roberts

kaminski-v	 CERA Alert: December 15, 2000   Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets  CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products   US Margin Highlights  * Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels,  US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel  to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned  to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at  exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average  $2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel  lower than this year's first quarter average.   * High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly,  averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel  from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented  values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater  that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.  * Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the  October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In  correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $5.75 per barrel.  * Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per  barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the  recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel  below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the  historical range.  US Demand Highlights  * Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million  barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four  weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago.  CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.  * Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94  mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this  time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million  barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high  level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories,  particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year.   * Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level  to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter.   * Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks  ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a  slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001.  US Inventory Highlights  * Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing  almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent  below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.  * Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8.  Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period.  Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements-albeit at a high price.   * Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to  reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter.  * Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.   **end**   This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.   **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

kaminski-v	 Vince, I'd like to purchase some copies of the XPRESS LP solver for the gas storage  optimization model.  We have previously discussed the purchase of CPLEX, but  after trialing both systems, have found some worthwhile advantages with  XPRESS.  If others find Planner / CPLEX best suited to their application, I  see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths, and  it is likely that I would use Planner/CPLEX myself on some future project if  we were to have both systems available.  XPRESS is particularly suited to my application because it handles Special  Ordered Sets.  This is a very efficient way of representing the storage  ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information  provided by the set, rather than just using binary integer variables to  represent the ratchets.  Planner is a C++ interface for CPLEX.  It has some significant limitations,  and does not permit access to all CPLEX features.  Dash Optimization have made the following offer: All software purchases made by Enron this year will be at 30% off the list  price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of  licenses to obtain this discount. 90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase. The EMOSL utility will be provided at no cost. The XBSL system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few  weeks time.  For the Gas Storage Optimization model, I would like to purchase: One development license, hyper version, with modeller, primal/dual simplex,  MIP search, dlls, EMOSL and XBSL when available.  List price $10,000  Discounted price  $7,000 Two run time licenses for above,  List price total $8,000    Discounted price  $5,600      Total cost  $12,600  I've used the usually security request system to set the purchase process  going, should you agree to this.  Tom. 
kaminski-v	 Hi Vince  I'd originally been told you wouldn't be back until Wednesday, and so have  another meeting booked for 4:30pm (London time) today.  I really need to  speak with you about the situation here in London re Anjam.  To be blunt,  Sharad, Kirstee and I have all been tempted to just walk out of the office  until Anjam is removed.  The major problems are: 1. I have no authority to demand Anjam should cooperate with Sharad, Kirstee  etc. on their work.  He does his best to impede their work, and I have no  ability to access his drives for data/spreadsheets. 2. Anjam removes me from the cc lists in reply to all emails received by him,  in an attempt to remove me from the loop. 3. Anjam continues to "do business", and people in London still think he's  head of Research. 4. Pending your "announcement", people will continue to go to Anjam, and the  business will remain dependent on him. 5. We're severely under-resourced.  I'm still awaiting your review of the  email I drafted for John S, requesting additional resource.  I can't make a  big recruitment drive until I have the authority to hire more. I honestly feel I can't do my job, and I'm currently asking myself what I'm  even doing here.  Notwithstanding the above, here is the current picture with our projects:  Steve 1. Initiated new pre-trade system for oil trading desk.  Hooked up relevant  IT resource with business people, keeping an overall eye on making sure the  business reqts get translated into IT-speak. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review. 3. Initiated global supply/demand database with coal group. 4. Constant firefighting across all desks.  Ben 1. Work on regression-based placement model. 2. General review of EnronCredit.com's quant models.  Matthew 1. Ongoing work with EnGOAL. 2. Produced first prototype of gas capacity charge optimisation tool for  Continental Gas desk.  Need to purchase local copy of CPLEX.  Kirstee 1. Diverted from Richard Lewis's request for the UK gas/power vol curves to  be sorted out, onto Eastern Virtual Power Station restructuring project.   Involves extension runs of credit reserve model, and now it seems the model  needs to be extended. 2. Constant VaR firefighting.  Slava 1. Finished all regressions and model identification for UK gas and power  demand forecasting.  We are now ready to start IT implementation. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review.  Sharad 1. Exotica support/firefighting, made nearly impossible by Anjam. 2. Option on strip of metals futures for Enron Metal.  I do hope we get a chance to speak and resolve some of these issues.  I'm  really not happy at present.  Best regards, Steve

kaminski-v	 I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this  memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.   As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate  Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on  a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly  improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also  need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA   regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.  In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your  groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's  in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team  Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233)  or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our  A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this  regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you  may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A  resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.  In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you  to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm  the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer  another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply  their name as soon as possible.   Please call with any questions.

kaminski-v	 Dear Mr. Kaminski:  As explained over the phone, I have been doing political, economic, and  strategic analysis for Terry Thorn, formerly head of government affairs for  EI. Most of my work has been focussed on Asia, a region in which I have deep  experience and speak major languages. Wtih the restructuring of the  Asia-Pacific group, Terry is moving to a new function and I am seeking a new  role. Since I have been based in Washington, DC, with more frequent trips to  Asia than to Houston, I still feel as though I don't know my way around the  company, a disadvantage in my current situation. Several people have  recommended that I talk to you about your shop, but more generally if you  have any ideas about where I might fit in, I would appreciate them.  I am attaching my resume, cv and a biographical sketch as you requested,  Edith Terry Enron/DC 
beck-s	 Hi Sally    Thanks for the attached.  In light of your response I think I'm after 2  things:     1. A spec that outlines Eugenio's role, and       2. A spec that could be used to hire a Japanese national to replace  Eugenio at the end of Eugenio's assignment in Japan.    Hope this helps. If you could revert asap I'd appreciate it.    Thanks    Phil     To: Phillip -SYDNEY- Taylor/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Re: Risk Position - Eugenio Perez    I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the  attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do  with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to  create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in  Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a  position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use  in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the  risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different  descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use  this.    Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.   
beck-s	 Ted/Sally,  I believe you are both aware of the situation, but here is our briefing note  for Sherriff,Brown,Causey, Buy.  Mike and I will be following-up with both of you.  Fernley

beck-s	 Dear Sally,  As requested I have addressed your questions as follows:  1. Put in actual date of reviews of each office - done 2. Indicate the difference between Phase I and Phase II of London are - done 3. Indicate that we are looking at non-wholly owned subsidiaries - done  (Marnier & EOTT) 4. AS a handout what are things that should have been cleared and weren't -  attached - also put in global issues 5. Change the timelines for current status & reviews not yet taking place  (Chicago, EOTT) - done 6. Send you the list of standards - attached on previous message 7. Determine what Now Sarzyna is - it is listed on the Enron Europe current  status schedule.  It is in Poland, and it is a JY poer station that should be  operational  May 00 (not sure if they met the date).  Due to start operations in Q2-3.   50% owned by Enron. 8. Send you the grid of Europe - sent in previous message.  As far as the global issues are concerned, my recommendations are:  1. Taping of phone lines - we should require for all trading offices 2. Use of mobile phones - we should ban the use of mobile phones to make  trades 3. Translation of settled contracts - I don't think its worth the cost.  It  can be done on an as needed basis if there are problems with the contracts  (although  since they are already settled it would be unlikely). 4. Enpower - for offices without the critical mass of transactions, Enpower  is not necessary but some controlled environment is required.  If Enpower is  not used,  they must be reviewed more frequently.  On another topic, all of the associates Jana offered and that would fit in  the role we were discussing are gone (3 were gone by the time we finished our  meeting). She  has given me additional resumes - mostly analysts, who would fit the  position.  However, I was thinking of getting an analyst and then switching  the person out for Jenifer Bagwell.  When I interviewed her she wasn't keen on travelling, but I  think its worth at least a discussion with her (since the position is a  better fit than her current).  Do you have any thoughts either way?  Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.  You can reach me at  212 715 5243.  Best regards,  Shona

kaminski-v	 Hi Mr. Kaminski,  Thank you for taking your time to interview me for opportunities at Enron. I enjoyed talking you and learning more about Enron and its dynamic business environment. I appreciate your consideration for a challenging and rewarding position in this industry. Please find the attached copy of my dissertation. If you have any problem in compiling this file, please let me know.  I respected your insights and perspective on the issues addressed in my Ph.D. dissertation; including the issues on creative model building, factors affecting natural gas and elctricity demand and supply, and implementation of these models to simulate the future and help traders in the decision making of their day to day business.  I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from you.

kaminski-v	 Tracy,  Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and  American option valuation models.   These are the generally accepted methods  for valuation of options on equity.   The "European" option prices assume  that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the  "American" style options can be exercised at any time during their life.     I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market  value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level.   The  volatility input is the other main assumption.   EOTT has been trading  recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking  further back, the range is much wider.  To run the model, you must be linked with the options library.   I am not  sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu  (x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module.   On the ENA  lan it is located under  O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll.    This is  loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in  location.  --Stinson x34748    P.S.   I will mail you a hard-copy of a plot showing recent EOTT volatility  as well.   If you would like us to help you in running specific examples,  please let me, Vince, or Zimin know.

beck-s	 As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting,  you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go  more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.   Here is one way.  Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the  SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but  projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to  charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where  people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the  extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is  customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within  a company.  To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each "organizational unit" (as I  said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU)  needs to be clear on questions such as:  1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP 2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost  center or projects one worked on) or "exceptions" only (e.g., vacation, sick  time, etc) 3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is 4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service  capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether  they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient  for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many  different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center  numbers or project codes  5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should  charge to  Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be  instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as  minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a  variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the  business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.  The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on  Friday, June 30.  Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay  periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is  desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in  getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if  you have any questions.

farmer-d	    The only valid "Buyback" ticket for Meter #: 1373 is Sitara Ticket #:  246408.  S. Ticket #: 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up  Buyback         ticket across Equistar's meters{1552,1384,1062,1553}. If  you recall  this process was done to enable Client Services to automate Equistar        allocation/billing. The project took place around April 2000  production retroactive back to Jan. 1999.  The link to compute the buyback is  set up         on S. ticket # 246408.         Since Equistar has begun doing business via ENA, it was necessary to  establish a "Buyback Ticket " on ENA's Matrix.        Thus, to answer your question, yes there should only be one "buyback  ticket" for meter #: 1373 on HPL  and ENA.         ENA activity is kept whole and the swing is on HPL.         I hope I have addressed all of your questions below however, I am  available for follow up discussion if needed.          It  has been a pleasure working with you.

After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit   risk management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer  my experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology   and methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit  trading managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in   trading, origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.  I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and  management.  I have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with  KMV Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV  in designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar  with its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the  empirical research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private  firm EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during  the creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.  I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming  skills. I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied  credit risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join  the credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my  combination of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience   and technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the   credit derivatives trading and risk management function.  I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me  at 201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss  this opportunity further.

kaminski-v	          Dear Vince:          It is my understanding that Ms. Kate Szablya (whom you apparently met this past week) of Power Brokers has expressed to you my interest in considering the possibility of working at ENRON. In addition I belive that she has forwarded to you my CV.          My communication with Ms. Szablya has been less than satisfactory for some time. Therefore Ms. Szablya is nolonger representing me and I would like Ms. Rita de Claris (whom I cc) of De Claris & Associates (713 - 868 - 4440) to represent me in the future in this search. I have instructed her to forward my CV to you once more.          Forgive me for this, perhaps unusual, step but I regard highly the opportunity of working at ENRON and do not feel I am being adequately represented at present.          I look forward to hearing from you soon.          Best regards          Joao 
farmer-d	 FYI       
kaminski-v	 Dear Professor Shreve,  Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation at Carnegie Mellon. I am discussing with Pierre Ste-Marie possible dates and it seems at this point that November the 3rd would be the most convenient day.  November the 10th is an alternative date, but I need a few more days to make a commitment.   Look forward to meeting you.   Vince Kaminski

beck-s	 Based on the recent changes in Global Markets, specifically Global Products  and Coal, the follow organizational changes have been implemented.  Michelle Bruce will assume the Global Products business lead role.  She will  be responsible for ensuring that the business processes and procedures are as  effective and efficient as possible.  She will also be working with other  groups and offices to ensure consistency of both performance measures and  business standards.  John Swinney, lead of Risk Management, and Lisa Walker,  lead of Logistics Coordination, will report directly to Michelle.  Michelle Thomason will continue in her current strategic planning role.  In  addition, she will assume the business lead role supporting new endeavors  that our will group will become involved in, including the cost of funds and  prepays activity.  Michelle will report to Michelle Bruce.  We are pleased to announce that Jeff Sorenson has joined the Global Products  management team .  He will be responsible for physical confirmations as well  as coordinating the financial confirmations and financial settlements for  Global Markets.  Lynn Shivers, Documentation lead and his group, will report  to Jeff.  Mark Leskowitz will continue to manage the trade accounting group for both  Global Products and coal as well as all physical settlements for both  business lines.  Julie Sengele will help with the physical settlements and  the coal trade accounting.  Julie will report directly to Mark.  Michelle Bruce, Jeff Sorsenson and Mark Leskowitz will report directly to me.  Simon Thurbin has joined us from the London office on a temporary assignment  working with Michelle Bruce to define consistent business processes,  practices and procedures.   As a result of this global effort, we will work  to ensure consistency and continuity between the Houston and London offices.  Joel Bennett has joined us from the London office.  He will be working on  changing the Global risk book process, which is being transitioned to Houston.  Shelly Stubbs will be going to London on a temporary assignment to work with  Cindy Horn focusing on processes on procedures, specifically controls.  Please join me in supporting all of these people in their new roles and  additional responsibilities.  Regards,  Scott 
beck-s	 Sally-   I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG  acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to  the list.  I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information  gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill.  I think we may have an  opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess  MG's remote offices.  If Brent were to linger in London for a few more  months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world  and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  Brent's  background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials  for doing the job.  I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it  seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.  What  are your thoughts?       
kaminski-v	 Vince/Stinson,  This is a summary fo the report submitted by the Godbole Committee appointed  by the state government to review the Dabhol project.  The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff.  A lot of what they  mention is something we won't agree to.  However, to me it seems apparent  that this can be worked out.  Regards, Sandeep. ---------------------- Forwarded by Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  04/16/2001 09:05 AM ---------------------------  
beck-s	 Dear Mike,  A lot of the needs listed in Tim's memo will also be needed in NY, but on a  smaller scale.  I'll put a resource requirement memo together by the end of  the week and then we can determine who would fit these requirements and where  these people should come from (London/Houston).  I think this project would be a great opportunity for some  analysts/associates (of course working under experienced personnel).  Regards  Shona       Mike Jordan@ECT 08/14/2000 02:56 AM To: Tim Poullain-Patterson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Andrew  Cornfield/LON/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Re: MG Integration : Resource Requirements    A good tee up - and one we should regularly reassess - here goes some initial  feedback which you should push back on :-  Valuation review - resource requirement to be defined in detail by Andy in  his new role - I think the offer from Eric of finding some Analysts and  Associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answer.  Balance Sheet substantiation - at present I assess the power and gas  substantiation process as priority - although we should review the resources  coming free from Global ( Chris and Rashpal ) as they may not be easily  useable by Raewyn - Chris is free at present and Rashpal promised for  Thunderball. Whilst I am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of  risk because AA would have done ( could do more ? ) some substantive / due diligence on  balance sheet The trade accountants at MG had a simplistic entity structure based around an  infrastructure where the AS400 did both the DPR and account posting  - unlike  our own systems - so inherent risk is lower ( excluding inventory ) we must make certain our efforts are aligned to Fin Ops !  Inventory - interesting one this - it should be very accurately controlled  already ( it is the business ??? ) yet the problem is that it is not  transparent at the consolidation level. I would like you to get David Tregar  to assess the level of risk with you ( and discuss with me and Philip Lord  the current securitisation of inventory ) before we put an action plan in  place for this balance sheet category  Integration / Controls - you should continue your efforts to bring the MG  priority to the functional stripe leaders' agenda - after Friday's meeting  they know the effort required are that recruitment is key  SAP - we will look to Michael Heap on this ( but we did identify some key  business analysis work for Kevin Rhodes to be done ASAP - we should track  this )  Remote offices - continues to be the dog that has not barked ( YET ) -  Richard, you and I need to rethink where we are  - particularly with South  America  Overall - we both agree more resources are required but they have to be  scoped quite precisely !  Thanks for the note     Tim Poullain-Patterson 11/08/2000 18:59 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: MG Integration : Resource Requirements  Mike,  As you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the  few resources we have on ground pretty thinly, leaving a residue of partially  completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point. Also, though we  are leveraging MG staff where we can, we have already made an assessment that  their support infrastructure is very lean - this is being stretched to  breaking point by the RW acquisition and various Enron integration  initiatives, e.g. establishing functional teams.  At present we have the following resources on the ground:    We are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of  operational risk. If we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we  need to commit additional resources to the project.   I assess our current resource needs as follows:  Valuation Review : the valuation review that Andy and I performed prior to  "effective control" date identified a number of complex valuation issues that  require further quantitative analysis. Also, there is imbedded optionality in  a lot of the physical business transacted throughout MG which should be  modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment (and if  there is any extra value to be extracted - Eric Gadd has recently prioritised  this!). Requirement - risk manager with developed quantitative/modelling  skills.  Balance Sheet Substantiation : a comprehensive validation of balances  including a review of reconciliation's, evidence of account ownership  (detection of "88888"'s accounts etc...) is overdue. Requirement - lead  accountant plus two juniors.  Inventory : a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances  - see earlier note to Eric Gadd. Requirement - one/two risk manager(s).  General Integration : having now identified the functional leads for MG in  London,  we are now due to involve the "stripe leaders" in the process of  creating the functional groups, including identifying gaps in resourcing. I  will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will  need extra staff that I am expecting the "stripe leaders" to provide.  Requirement - to be determined by "stripe leaders".  SAP : ??? Requirement - to be determined by SAP project team.  Remote Offices : the above requests relate to the London office only. Having  identified Enron Controllers for the offices in the Far East I do not  envisage significant issues integrating those offices. However, I have  minimal understanding of what our requirements in the US and South America  are, and propose deferring that discussion to another time...  Regards, Tim

farmer-d	 http://www.pge-texas.com/www/gtt.nsf/htmlmedia/operations.html 
beck-s	 I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several  issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better  solution for the money.    Option 1 The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to  monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.  Option 2 I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If  you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :    2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores  that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per  record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently  with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive  alternative          (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).   2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be  provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a  weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has  not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates  than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to  transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost  for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score.   Option 3 D&B Connect Product.  D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated  reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that  enables the  most effective integration of customer information and  third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and  information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate  identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete  relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of  referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so  that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your  organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B  Connect is scalable.     Cost Typically ranging from  * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000  * CAM Online - $50,000  * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data  With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.   Questions/Issues  1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron  customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained  that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers,  but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available  externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this  understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be  imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be  negotiated.  2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?   Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score reference  above were explored as an example.  3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?  4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S.  companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of  default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This  rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.   This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this  score in a batch manner.  5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit  analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is  probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if  the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased  usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.   If you would like me to follow up further, please give me a call at  713-853-6079.  
farmer-d	 The following seminar will be given several times this year.

kaminski-v	 John,  This is a resume I received today from  my friend. Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to me:   Dear Vincent,  I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.  I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership with Albert Friedberg.   I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.  I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and research in the field of energy markets.

beck-s	 Sally, Jeff Skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ENA was still about  97% year on year. I don't know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is  increased volume per trade.  We are currently preparing a zero-base estimate of future support costs to  assess the benefits v costs of all projects. Assuming that the business in Europe will develop in a similar way to  America, but a few years behind, it would be most useful to have some more  statistics for several years back. Who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could  help us?  Many thanks, Richard 
kaminski-v	 Folks:  It is my pleasure to announce the visit of professor Rene Carmona from  Princeton on February 13, 2001.  (This web site may provide a little information on professor Carmona:   http://www.princeton.edu/~rcarmona/)  Professor Carmona is going to talk to us about his research endeavors in  weather and financial engineering.

beck-s	 The Risk Management Policy requires signoff on the DPR by individuals  designated by the COO and CRO of Enron Corp.  Currently, Greg is the sole  authorized signer.  Given that he is moving into cyberspace it has been  proposed that we split the world in half with John L taking the Western  Hemisphere and John S taking the rest of the world.  I am currently drafting  a memo for Jeff and Rick' s signature to that effect,  In the meantime, I  would expect that Greg remain the official signer.  I will forward that draft  memo to you for commentary under separate cover.  Once we have agreed on who  as responsibility for what, we will ask that the Johns reply to an E-mail  request for approval. Eventually, we will create an automatic approval via  the Executive Reports viewer.  Before finalizing process, there are some  issues that ought to be clarified, such as, who will signoff for the Merchant  Portfolios that are not part of either Johns direct responsibility (Southern  Cone, CALME), Broadband, the Capital Portfolio.  For pure process reasons, we  would like to keep the number of signers ot a minimum.  It is difficult  enough to get Greg to sign off in a timely manner, it would be too cumbersome  for Mike Moscoso or Chris Abel to chase down someone from every business unit  every day for approvals.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes to this proposal. Ted x3-3324 ps. Liz, make sure Greg pays attention to this e-mail! 
kaminski-v	 Ted,  Enclosed is a corrected version of the historical simulation of WTI  trading.    The earlier results were double counting the spread profit on  trades closed intra-day.   The spread was counted on each trade rather than  per round-trip transaction, so the new results show lower profitability.    --Stinson

kaminski-v	  Christian,  Our Spring/Fall window of "?nactivity"is rapidly eluding us...  We need to get our internal model operational without delay.  Along these lines, let's go ahead and plan your visit to Houston as soon as possible,  but by all means get you in at least 4 weeks before hurricane season.  That would mean the month of May looks good.  Please inform me what duties you could not perform from here to support the Sydney office,  we'll figure out how to keep that office whole.  (it's working without a hitch to have Steve Bennett in London, but continuing his Houston duties)  If the first week in May (for the whole month) will work, please respond asap and we'll get housing arrangements finalized.  Looking forward to your visit,  - - - Mike

kaminski-v	 Dear Vince,  Dzien dobry. Many thanks for agreeing to take the remainder of the VaR seminar - it is a great help. I asked Raymond Yeow of Enron Australia if he would chair day one but he said that you would be a bigger draw and perhaps better placed. To this end, I am hoping that you would consider chairing day one's plenary session and trading stream. You can blame Raymond for recommending you!  I appreciate that this is asking even more of you than you originally signed up for but you seem to be famous in this small market and it would be great if you could do it. I apologise for imposing once again but look forward to hearing back from you when you get a chance. As ever, let me know if you have any questions.  Best regards,  Joel

Here are some answers to your questions.  Waskom is a field in East Texas (Harrison County) where we purchase gas from PennzEnergy at the Bryson C.P. and Jeter #2 wells.  The gas is termed up to  New Waskom Gas Gathering (NWGG) through June 2001 (the term of the PennzEnergy purchase).  We then buy the gas back from NWGG into our Tetco East Texas pool ... also termed up through 6/01.  Virginia Field used to be associated with NGPL, but several years ago PennzEnergy worked out a processing arrangement with Corpus Christi Gas Gathering, so the gas is now termed up with CCGM through 6/01 ... priced off  of the Houston Ship Channel.  Jennings Ranch used to flow into NGPL through a gathering line, but a couple  of years ago NGPL sold that line to Midcon Texas, so we now handle it as another Midcon Texas property.  Sometimes we sell it at the meter to Midcon Texas  (KN), and sometimes we ship it through Midcon to our NGPL South Texas pool.  Carthage:  Altra picks up their gas in their Cartwheel agreement.  The agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement.  It is not much different than a Hub agreement, except it allows title tracking.  TGT on the whiteboard refers to Texas Gas ... East Ohio takes their gas into Texas Gas on a couple of different transport contracts.  Let me know if you have more questions.  David

farmer-d	 Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the  formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability  to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the  years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will  lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the  creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy  service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their  development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for  developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's  business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere  in Enron.  Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become  Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of  experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where  he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination  activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.  Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office  of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and  Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.

Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet  Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director  in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's  core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural  origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus  on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom,  Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business  model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of  Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure  will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing  profitability.  John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John  has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years  and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.   Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron  NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the  deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron  Americas.  Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take  over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership,  Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.   Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing  Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination  activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper,  Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

beck-s	 In a frank discussion with Barry I had to advise him that it will be very  difficult for him to succeed in the role I proposed for him (and indeed in  his current role in the medium term). He is standing in the cross-hairs of a  rifle sight - one move and he's dead.  I have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which  will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are  used to seeing from him.  Of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support  operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been. I shall be  looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co-ordination role - as you  know, individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare.  Fernley   
farmer-d	 For prior periods - I am not sure if you need to handle this using the  instructions below - or if for prior months ONLY - if  you would be allowed  to create a  cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances.   Your controller  and volume management (Kathy Kelly) should make this call.  Kim and David can brain check me on this - but I think this is how parking  should be done; however, please verify with West or East desk economics to ensure accuracy/consistency.  PARKING PROCEDURES  Create a Storage deal in SITARA - Service Type: Parking   Use this service deal to path to a storage account in UNIFY - this way you  have accounted for the gas in UNIFY Inject into storage account Withdrawal from storage account  (When you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a  "loan")   Create two economic deals in SITARA - Exchange deal Create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position  purposes - (no invoices - fake 3rd party)  Exchange deal -  Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back)  Within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees  which can be recorded on the Storage deal. Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) -   Price = $0 Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back) Price = $0  When the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the  short term you record a big loss - sell at $0 - and the  next month you record a big gain - buy at $0.   To manage this - usually the  cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick  up the time  spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value.      When you are adjusting your physical injections (parking) within the month -  you will need to adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the P&L for the time spread  accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems.  Period 1 - Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) -   Price = $0   Swap  to firm book for Index + mid Period 2 - Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back) Price = $0    Swap to firm book for Index + mid

beck-s	 Shona, Brent and Sally, This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by  Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296  this morning.  Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk  Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving  global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into  another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk  Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its  cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by  being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from  the ECT Group on Friday.  Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge Enron's cash flows when  so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a  good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily  by 7:30 am.  Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for  changes in book heirarchy.   Sheila

beck-s	 Mike, I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the  Corporate system at  11:00 Houston time.  Either London operations or Houston  operations did not do something.  To me that is the breakdown.  I don't have  any further knowledge nor do I expect to have any further.  The point of my  e-mail is to alert you to a reality that I would prefer you not have to deal  with, i.e., incur the rath of Dave Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert and  Jeff Skilling when they understand what happened and based on what inadequate  management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I  am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually  guarantee the reaction of those people if this were to come to light.  So, I  suggest that you talk to Sally and create a process by which to insure that  the possibility of it happening again is minimized.

Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.   Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the  variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for  the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is  the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.   ---------------------   Lisa Kinsey 03/21/2000 08:12 AM To: Kenny J Soignet/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: CILCO STORAGE  Kenny, Attached is the worksheet that I have been using to verify Cilco's storage  balance with Vonda Seckler from Cilco.

Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East = will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas w= ere done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA fo= r each of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not h= ave the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of acc= ounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we = have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their = side of the UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going = to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be signi= ficant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this=  lower level of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at th= e different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still perform= ing their analysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in=  the meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opin= ion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across = the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process = will need to be able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisio= ns were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will re= main unchanged for this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss f= urther.

farmer-d	 Tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional Big Cowboy production is coming from.  Apparently, HPL cut a deal to purchase this gas at "HPL meters" at Rocher and Big Cowboy #2, so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe.  All along, these volumes have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.    We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant, effective April 1.  This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward.  Please let me know if you have any further questions, comments, or information to add.   Mary

Cheers, Scott 
farmer-d	 We have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to  analyze the Producer Services portion of the P&L.  To do this, we have been  looking at daily volumes on the 96026572 contract.  POPS shows a daily BAV of  approximately 612,000.  MOPS shows a daily BAV of approximately 601,000.  I  wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you.  By the way,  it also looks like the noms for the gathering contract are a lot higher,  around 750,000 per day.  Please advise as to how you feel these BAv's come in compared to what you  expect.  Thank you.   Heidi 
farmer-d	 I have spoken with Clem, this meter is now "non-allocatable", not unlike  meter 8751on Big Cowboy.  This meter needs to be set up as a Receipt Meter  attached to the Gulf Energy 27-009-08 agreement.  This gas began flowing on  7/7/00, so deal ticket 380710, which begins 9/1/00 will need to be backed up  to July to account for the purchase of this production.  Bob:  Please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that I can have  Fred set up accounting arrangements on Gulf Energy.  Fred:  Can you please determine whether or not we have paid CCGM for this gas?  Once again, thank you all for your assistance.  Mary 
beck-s	 Thanks for the update with respect to the PRC.  I will be in Houston for VAR  training on September 21 & 22.  I will probably come down 1 or 2 days before  if you want to schedule my review during that time. Peggy         
beck-s	 Fernley, On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage  who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for  doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.   Subsequently, Richard was "moved" from his position and Barry promoted.   If  that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your  credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back  office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London  by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely  mistaken.  On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John  Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily  completing the Audit tasks from London. I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed  my "advice" and you need to do what you need to do. If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out  of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a  responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to  surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will  be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money  trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere. Need I go on.  Let us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose. Ted     Fernley Dyson 02/09/2000 04:56 AM To: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Ted,  We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on  specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and  prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and  the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has  changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality  risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary  recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).   Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the  Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I  suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -  his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his  considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult  to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to  address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this  issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable"  offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management  style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and  objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)  with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a  different story to tell on Helsinki.  As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',  although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks  back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy  to contribute staff to this too.  Regards  Fernley     To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Fernley, As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I  think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  "prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal. Ted    Fernley Dyson 02/08/2000 04:07 PM To: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Trading Support Operations - London  Rick,  Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support  function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we  already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.  The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.

beck-s	 Dear David,  Thanks for your message.  To make our request clearer, for the past two weeks  we have put out a preliminary DPR every morning at 8 am our time (seen by  commercial heads, Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, RAC, anyone with access to the  DPR).  All groups world-wide are able to provide us preliminary figures by 7  am our time for:  positions,  maturity gap, VAR, and P&L  This is the information that we would like you to provide as well.  I understand that you have some hurdles to get over to be able to provide us  these figures, and while you keep working to get over these hurdles, we would  be happy if you provide us the information you are currently able to (i.e. if  you can only provide P&L we'd like to start with that, if you can only  provide us with one commodities information we would like to have that).  Please remember that the information we are requesting is preliminary  information.  We would expect that there would be some changes between what  you give us at 7 am and the final information you give us by 11 am.  Best regards  Shona      David A Wall@ECT 10/27/2000 06:57 AM To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron cc: James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Chris Abel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheila Foo/LON/ECT@ECT,  Michael Kass/EU/Enron@Enron   Subject: DPR Summary  Shona,  Just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday:  Preliminary P/L due @ 1PM Local (7pm Houston)  As I understand, Sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of  presenting Skilling with a DPR by 8a.m. the following day. I have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this.  We will discuss  this in meeting early next week.  A major obstacle that we face, is limited IT resource to re-engineer and  expedite our processes.  This will require buy in of senior mgmt and  commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects.  (James to discuss.) Additionally, there are certain dependencies on depts in Houston, which are  prerequisite for DPR completion in London. Notably Continental Power has a  dependency on Portcalc IT support in Houston.   Shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult (not impossible) to implement  in London as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions  would make Enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer.  Bear in mind  that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best  talent.  A decision to use shift's would have to be made at the highest level  considering the possible implications on the corporate image.  This might  suggest that additional IT resource is the only feasible way forward.  I could easily say that we can do the preliminary p/l but I assume that we  wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting.  Therefore I have  tempered my comments to reflect what I believe are real issues that we in  London will have to address.   We will get back to you with our proposals.,  after we have discussed these issues early next week.  Same day DPR  This is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to  be sponsored at the highest level here in Europe. James to discuss with Fernley & Mike.    Regards,  Dave

farmer-d	 Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however,  there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I  checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate  of 7,394 MMBTu.    Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked  OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does  seem strange that this is the only month of flow.  Thanks, Stella

farmer-d	 The new SITARA to UNIFY bridge monitor is in production.  The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge  (pending) - for deals going to UNIFY from SITARA.  You will find it under - Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge  Monitor.  You may need to load the Borland BDE v5.0 software to use this, if not  already loaded.   We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.     If deal is in an error state on the SITARA side - we have not sent it over to  UNIFY. If the deal in an error state on the UNIFY side - SITARA has sent it to UNIFY  - however - it is in the UNIFY failed deal group.  You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.  The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal.  Start Date and Stop Date - are begin and end date of deal.  SITARA deal ID - as well as - EOL deal ID.  Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.  If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the STATUS = P  deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions  (awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal).  If you  release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have  access to multiple desks.   You can hit the refresh button to re-query the data - or set the auto refresh  on the tool bar.  We did not build Filter by Business Unit for multiple reasons: - the expense to build the filter. - it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing. - if there is a new business unit - you will see it. - normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error  state - once Petro Can/Suncor/Sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable   number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column.  - If you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel  feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.  If you have any questions or problems - please call the SITARA hotline.

kaminski-v	 Jeff,  I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 -  30 minutes to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze. A separate message about  this visit will follow.  I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships  with different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.  We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we  are not very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:  1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently   underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results. Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock-up some very promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs.  2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every  presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions. It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic  program. In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years.  3. Visits by faculty members in Enron.   Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important  in shaping public  opinion on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets).  Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and  focus.  I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level)  responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from  our Analyst/Associate program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.  Vince

beck-s	 Evidently, we need to get Mike and James' consent to send someone over to  London....  Clara was over there working on rate & currency which has nothing  to do with London.  I am starting to hear more and more noise about James' attitude.  It is  getting to the point (and possibly is already) that no one wants to work with  him and it could isolate London operations even further from the mainstream.   It may be time for someone to have a heart-to-heart with him (Fernley?).   -----Original Message----- From:  Glover, Sheila   Sent: Wednesday, April 18, 2001 8:10 AM To: Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ENRON Subject: Re: Clara Carrington  Brent I will call to discuss. sg ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT on 04/18/2001 08:09  AM ---------------------------

I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not  find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked  notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both  volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call  into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I  thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause  Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did  not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can  check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will  let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your  house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is  right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls  call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is  to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can  hear your car...pretty basic.? Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that  meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let  you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with  you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so  we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan  suggested that.?  ? Have a good trip. Linda

kaminski-v	 Hello all,  The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can be found on our web site at  http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html  I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio. First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations. At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count. I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a form.  Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the plaza from the hotel).  We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m. so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the evening so stay tuned.

kaminski-v	 Valery,  I am interested in receiving the preprint. On another note, I would be glad to meet you for lunch/dinner sometimes during the next few weeks.  Please, let me know what would be the best time to meet.  Vince   Vincent Kaminski Managing Director - Research Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street Room EB1962 Houston, TX 77002-7361  Phone: (713) 853 3848 Fax  :  (713) 646 2503 E-mail: vkamins@enron.com     "Valery Kholodnyi" <vkholod1@txu.com> on 12/20/2000 03:13:09 PM To: vkamins@enron.com cc:   Subject: My model for spikes     Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

beck-s	 Sally, I met with Jeff Shankman, Hunter Shively, Fletch Sturm and Laura Luce  yesterday re: Chicago resources. Everyone is in agreement that we need to  assign the overall Chicago office support activities to one individual within  your group who will be completely responsible for activities relative to deal  booking, DPR accuracy, P/L accuracy, transfer pricing accuracy, accounting,  scheduling, (EOL activity support?), etc. This will be a full-time job I  think. Could we make this happen asap. Let's get together and discuss if need  be. Thanks Sally! 
kaminski-v	 I discovered that Clewlow and Strickland have at least two books, "Implementing Derivative Models," and "Exotic Options."  I gather that "Exotic Options" is the one you intend to use in your class, correct?  By the way, I queried participants in my class, and I heard that the case study approach we occaisionally used was appreciated by several.  The VAR class I taught was from Jorian's book, which has no exercises and which assumes a particular background in finance and statistics.  I created a problem (not exactly a case study) that required participant to learn some statistics and try some different approaches.  From this, participants got a better idea of why one bothers with certain issues.  Some liked the "real world" flavor of this kind of approach.  (Without the case approach, you could provide good counterexampes as a partial remedy.)  Best regards and Season's Greetings, Michael 
kaminski-v	 NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH on LINUX Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop? 03/15/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss=20 on the corporate desktop? --------------------------------------------- By Phil Hochmuth  So far this year, the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems, with the growth of Linux severs being most heralded. According to IDC, a research firm based in Framingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operating system last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linux was the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT, capturing 24% of new licenses shipped.  As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances, because the system can be modified to handle specialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as Cobalt Networks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-based appliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.  But what of the open source hacker=01,s dream of =01&Linux on every desktop= ?=018  Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, with colorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux now available at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said that Linux=01,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems.  According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. The hold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong, analysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft=01,s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of Linux.  Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product=01,s desktop future. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux=01,s future on desktops. Dyroff said, =01&given the lack of applications available, we really can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.=018  A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops. According to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, open source operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the number jumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 2002.  Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factors that will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client desktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) and available applications.  One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo Alto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. According to Eazel=01,s Web site, the company=01,s goal is to bring Linux to the mass= es and =01&do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to mere mortals.=018  The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and is allied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linux desktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-based file management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and will help standardized the look and feel of Linux for =01&regular=018 users. For enterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side, this development will be worth keeping an eye on.  On the applications side, several office productivity suites have been available for some time, such as Sun=01,s StarOffice suite and KOffice for the KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such as WordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by Linux Care Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port of MS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.  While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop, there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise nets in the future.

beck-s	 Mary, Larry and Wes, We just received a faxed copy of the Manual Wire and Same Day Payment memo  which was sent by Betty Tauzier on 8/28/00. Rate & Currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires  next day payments for FX.  Currently we are severely hampered because our  infomation is required into Unify by 2:30 for an Accounts Payable run at 4:00  for next day payments.  We are still trading after these cut-offs and tying  out the day's activity with Trading.  Therefore, we currently have to rely on  manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date.    We need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements.  I would  like to get the Accounts Payable run for our companies, 842 and 967, moved to  after 5:00 pm.  Information is not due to the bank until next day. 8:00 am  London time.  Please let Laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing  flows. Thanks. Sheila

Saudi's sold Cal 00 naphtha at $8 M/T over the Platt's AG mean and the  Kuwaiti's are offer their naphtha at $11 M/T over the mean.  ENOC offered 700,000 tons of term naphtha and only sold 200,000 tons. ADNOC's splitters should add even more naphtha supplies to the market. Koch has closed their Rotterdam splitter due to poor economics. Not  necessarily a permanent shutdown. He expects the Brent/Dubai spread to return to more normal $1-$1.25/barrel. Regarding condensate he predicts that actual demand will drive the market and  there will be less bottomfeeding by the Japanese and other refiners. He does  feel         the new splitters will reduce the worldwide volumes available,  but that there will still be adequate supplies.  He thinks crack spreads for refiners will still be weak during Cal 00. Although some resid demand will be displaced by natural gas or LNG, he  expects fairly stable differentials to crude. He expects strong US gasoline demand, but limits his demand growth projection  to 1% for the year.

beck-s	 Hi Sally,  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to get in touch with you as the  PRC process begins to take off.  I was hoping we could meet briefly at  sometime in the next couple of weeks.  I rotated into a new group (U.S.  Network Development) in late August and am doing very different work within  EBS.  I would welcome the chance to share some of this and other thoughts of  mine with you.  My schedule is quite flexible, so if there is a time that is  convenient with you, please let me know and I'll stop by.  Probably 15  mintues would be adequate.  Thank you, and I hope to see you soon.

kaminski-v	 Nick,  Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford. I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's plan to meet for dinner then.  I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research   project. We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it. It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection of the research topics.  We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns. Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall  welcome him with open arms.  I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the  arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.  Vince       Nick Bambos <bambos@stanford.edu> on 12/20/2000 12:14:40 PM To: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com cc: Stinson.Gibner@enron.com  Subject: Stanford Project   Hello Vince and Stinson,  First of all,  BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!  If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together some time to have dinner.  I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!  We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the  student to develop a realistic vision about their research.  Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of  course you could visit us before that too.   With my WARMEST WISHES,  Nick

kaminski-v	 Stinson,  Yes, makes perfect sense. Brad can start the process.  Vince      Stinson Gibner 03/10/2000 02:15 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Green card for Paulo  Vince:  Now that Paulo is a manager, I think we can start the process for trying to  get him a permanent resident status.  Should I contact Brad McSherry about this?  --Stinson   
farmer-d	 We've talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach:  Remind Brazos that under Exhibit 7.12, page 2 of the PPA, Brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant's MDQ (45,000 Dth/d) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request.  The partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first, gas for resale second.  If Brazos' electric nominations by hour would, given ambient conditions, cause us to use at or above the plant's MDQ under its contracts with Apache/Williams (45,000 Dth/d), gas nominations will be zero.  This needs to be handled between the operators.  I've emphasized "at or above" on purpose; if an all electric nomination would cause Brazos to burn in excess of 45,000 Dth per day, we will honor that request (we're looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past, as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss).    After being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment, Brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires (provided they're still capped at 45,000 Dth/d if they take gas).  Whenever they go this route, however, we need to hold them to the electric nomination (i.e., they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount).  Remind Brazos that under the PPA, they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they've elected to take gas.  If the issue of precedent comes up, remind them that we're operating in a new territory and that electric-gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months; it wasn't until recently that we've been able to attribute imbalance penalties to Brazos, which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely.  As a show of good faith, we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed/nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations.  Hope this helps to clarify where we are.  RH   -----Original Message----- From:

kaminski-v	 Dear Lloyd & Richard,  I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern  that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of  issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk  management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a  (by no means exhaustive) list:-  i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data  for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist  in this matter. iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.  Best regards,  Anjam Ahmad Research x35383

In light of your response I think I'm after 2  things:     1. A spec that outlines Eugenio's role, and       2. A spec that could be used to hire a Japanese national to replace  Eugenio at the end of Eugenio's assignment in Japan.    Hope this helps. If you could revert asap I'd appreciate it.

If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do  with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to  create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in  Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a  position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use  in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the  risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different  descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use  this.    Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.

beck-s	 Hi, Brent  I have a potential house for you to see if you are interested. It is very  large and is in a beautiful location right near Hampstead Heath. The current  occupiers are moving out most likely at the beginning of April and Enron  holds the lease until the end of June. The commute is approx 35 mins to the  office.  It is in an incredible area and is very spacious with a large garden so I  would recommend seeing it. Cost is o1400 p/w plus I would need to arrange  furniture which would not be a problem.   Are you interested and if so, can you see it on Tuesday afternoon? If so,  what time would be best?  Sorry I can't offer it to you, Sally, but we won't have it long enough unless  the landlord would allow us to extend which is a possiblity.   Regards Tara

beck-s	 Sally and Brent, Here are the details behind our phone calls this morning. "M" is millions.  Sheila ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT on 08/31/2000 11:43  AM ---------------------------   Clara Carrington 08/31/2000 10:31 AM To: Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Joyce Kuo/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: Summary of Cash Flow Events  Sheila,  We have been having issues with the commodity cash flows since last Friday,  Aug 25.  This is a listing of what's been going on.               TIME PDH DATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION  8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look  right.  Valerie left voice mail          late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as           final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the          cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final           number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000          PV01 affect.                7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we  replaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging  could begin.      10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that  the             original cash flows received were real. We then had to           bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH           reports.  8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.  8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked  really weird.           The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01          affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He          indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized           Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their           Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted          the old ones.  8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.   The book was not officialized       7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash  flows.  We again          substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I  talked with          Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been  officialized.          (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in  the           ERMS system. )  8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created  a 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted     8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M  loss in their book,           but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the  incorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we  used the previous day's cash          flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow,  therefore          it took even longer to produce a revised report.  
kaminski-v	 Frank,  regarding simulating power prices in VAR we might discuss the following items and show some results: 1. Clustering for power:  - clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;  - geographical clustering;  - flexibility in choosing "core curves" (based on position size); 2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:  - parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)  - working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios; 3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters. 4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series). 5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.  Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.

beck-s	 The below email is in regards to the cost charts Sheri asked that I provide to Greg Piper.  The comment, "The goal for us is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday" is why I am forwarding the email to you.  I will dig deeper to understand the purpose.  Also, Sally the gas chart is for both Financial and Physical and the increase in cost for February is due to social security and unemployment taxes.  These cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be reversed during March.   ---------------------- Forwarded by James Scribner/Corp/Enron on 04/02/2001 10:05 AM --------------------------- From:

kaminski-v	 We are proposing the following changes to the calculation of NG correlations:  1. weight the data set (3 calendar months) used in calculating correlations  (most recent data weighed heavier) 2. use respective contract prices, instead of prompt month prices (i.e. for  Nov-00 correlations use Nov contract prices for the last 3 months, as opposed  to prompt month prices for the last three months.   Tanya,  I have confirmed with Ted and he gave us green light to make both changes.  Did we get an opinion from Vince?  Winston,  It is my understanding, that this changes apply to NG correlations only, not  the correlations between commodities. We will test the changes in gas and  then decide on world-wide implementation. Any estimate on timing of this  implementation?  Cassandra,  Ted suggested that you and Veronica should document this as a change in VaR  parameters and inform all commercial desk heads of these changes. We intend  to make them for NA gas first, but ultimately make these changes consistent  across all commodity groups. Let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Vlady.      Wenyao Jia 10/13/2000 03:43 PM To: Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jin Yu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: VAR calibration issues     Vlady,  Also in the meeting, we identified that there are still some issures  regarding to the correlation matrix calculations.  Since different commodity has different expiration dates.  When calculate  correlation between two commodities, the two may have different prompt  months.  Are we going to use prices on two different prompt months OR are we  going to use the prices on the SAME month disregarding prompt months.  Because above issues, Jin is not going do any changes on the correlation  matrix calculation until above issures can be solved.  Thanks!  Winston       Tanya Tamarchenko 10/13/2000 03:16 PM To: Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Wenyao Jia/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jin Yu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jin Yu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: VAR calibration issues    Vlady, we met with Winston and Jin today regarding VAR calibration issues.  The outcome on this discussion is: 1. Jin will put weights into calculation of factor loadings; 2. Jin will change the way factor loading are calculated. For each commodity  the prompt month contract will be selected for the effective date of vatrfacs  run. Then the historical prices will be collected for 3 month for all forward  contracts starting from selected prompt month contract. The variance-covariance matrix will be  calculated based on these data, it will be converted into correlation matrix, then  factor loadings  analysis will be performed on the correlation matrix.

Though the  Mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes, for Financial Trading  simply substitute Mike Farmer and Howard Carter with Michael Hutchinson and  Kevin Rhodes respectively.  Staff  This sheet simply attaches names to each of the Middle and Back Office  functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled Org. Staff within the  Middle Office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting  concept whereby they report to both the Business Controller and Functional  Lead.   The intention is that quite soon after moving into Enron House the functional  teams for both Financial Trading and Mechanting will start to more closely  together. The influence of the Functional Leads should ensure that these  teams are blended into a generic Enron Metals support group, where possible  leveraging across the other trading support groups.

kaminski-v	 You are welcome to attend the following meeting in the area of quantitative and computational finance and risk management in the MRC Auditorium on the Georgia Tech campus from 1 pm to 6 pm on Friday, March 30th.  There will be five speakers that will give presentations on a variety of topics.  Dr. Curt Hunter, Research Director, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  Dr. Mary Mathewes Kassis, Associate Director, Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center  Dr. Alan White, Professor of Finance, University of Toronto, and Mr. Pete van Amson, CFA, CPA, Vice President, Product Management, SunGard Trading and Risk Systems  Dr. Dennis Wong, Vice President, Quantitative Finance, Bank of America Securities  There is no charge for the event. This will be the inaugural meeting of the Atlanta Chapter of the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). You need not be a member of GARP to attend the meeting. Information about GARP can be found at http://www.garp.com.  We are asking that attendees RSVP so that plans can be made for refreshments. We only ask that you reply to this email or to atlanta@garp.com before March 21 if you plan to attend. In addition to a break half-way through the afternoon, there will be refreshments immediately following the presentations.  This event is sponsored by the Master of Science in Quantitative and Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech, SunGard Trading and Risk Systems, and SunTrust Banks, Inc.  Please pass along this announcement to your associates. _______________________________________________________________________ Information about the talks and the speakers  Dr. Curt Hunter Research Director, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  Dr. Hunter's discussion is entitled "Lessons Learned from Recent Global Financial Crises."  Since 1990, major banking and currency crises have occurred in many countries around the world - including Mexico and Latin America in 1994, East Asia in 1997-98, and Russia and Brazil in 1998, among others - with large costs both to the individual countries experiencing the crises and to other nations.  As a result, considerable effort has been expended by economists and policymakers to identify the causes of these crises and to design programs with the aim of preventing, if possible, similar crises from occurring in the future, and minimizing the costs when they do occur.  This talk reviews the key lessons policymakers have learned from these recent episodes and highlights the role that risk management plays in crisis prevention.  Dr. William C. (Curt) Hunter is senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.  He is a member of the Bank's Management Committee and serves as the Bank's chief economist. He is responsible for a staff of 115 professionals and oversees the Bank's research activities in the areas of monetary policy, banking and financial markets, and regional economics programs.  He is also responsible for the Bank's Statistical and Financial Reports function. Dr. Hunter is an associate economist on the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve System's primary monetary policy group. Previously, he was a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and has served on the faculties of the University of Georgia, Emory University, Chicago State University, and Northwestern University. He has consulted with numerous foreign central banks, official agencies, and private corporations and serves on the boards of several research and nonprofit organizations.  He is co-editor of Research in Banking and Finance and serves on the editorial boards of several academic journals.   Dr. Hunter earned a B.S. degree in 1970 from Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), an MBA in Finance in 1972 and a Ph.D. in Finance and Environment in 1978 from Northwestern University.  Dr. Mary Mathewes Kassis Associate Director, Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center  Dr. Kassis will provide her outlook for the Georgia and Atlanta economies over the next two years.  She will focus on economic risks specific to Atlanta, including its exposure to the contraction of the IT sector, potential over development of office space, and a declining rate of job growth.  Regardless of your field, this should be a very informative discussion.  Dr. Kassis has been analyzing the Southeast economy for over five years. She writes a quarterly report that examines the current economic conditions in 13 Southeastern states as well as an outlook for the next couple of years. She also prepares an in-depth quarterly analysis of the outlook for the Georgia and Atlanta economies.  She is regularly quoted in publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle.  Dr. Kassis received a B.A. in Economics and Political Science from Agnes Scott College and a Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University.  Dr. Alan White Professor of Finance, University of Toronto Mr. Pete van Amson, CFA, CPA Vice President, Product Management, SunGard Trading and Risk Systems  Dr. Alan White and Mr. Peter van Amson will discuss applied term structure modeling.  SunGard has implemented a version of the Hull-White term structure model that banks use in measuring and managing the market value sensitivity of various balance sheet components.  Peter will touch on some of the complexities involved in modeling non-maturity deposits; with regard to the term structure of interest rates, Alan will discuss some of the problems and possible solutions in bridging the divide between what is required from a theoretical standpoint and what is feasible in a production process.  Dr. Alan White is a Professor of Finance in the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. His research is principally in the area of derivative securities, their pricing and their use by financial institutions for risk management. He is most noted for his work on modeling the term structure of interest rates in a way that is consistent with observed market data. Recently his research has been focused on the pricing and management of credit risk.  Professor White has published many scholarly articles, but is perhaps best recognized for providing lucid insights into the practical application and implementation of this research. Much of his material is included in the best-selling book Hull-White on Derivatives, co-authored with John Hull.  Mr. Peter van Amson is the Vice President of Product Management at SunGard Trading and Risk Systems where he is responsible for the development of all functional specifications for the BancWare product suite.  In this capacity, he frequently interacts with SunGard user-committees, leading academics, and other leading industry practitioners.  He frequently makes presentations at conferences and seminars sponsored by BAI, AMIfs, the OCC, as well as other organizations. Prior to working with BancWare, Peter headed the Strategic Planning Function for the Plymouth Rock Company, one of America's most profitable insurance holding companies.  In this role, he helped define the company's strategic vision as well as being involved in investment analysis, asset/ liability management and quantitative profitability aanalysis.  Peter has a B.S. and M.S. in Accounting from the State University of New York at Binghamton.  He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan.  Peter has received numerous academic awards and honors including the William Andrew Paton Fellowship at the University of Michigan and the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants Award for Academic Excellence.  Dr. Dennis Wong Vice President, Quantitative Finance, Bank of America Securities  Dr. Wong will discuss competing vendor approaches to credit risk modeling, including CreditMetrics, KMV, CreditRisk+ and CreditPortfolio View.  These models are viewed in a theoretical framework that identifies migration probabilities, credit exposure and loss aggregation.  Dr. Wong has a Ph.D. in Mathematical Finance from Carnegie Mellon University.  He has given talks and seminars for the American Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the University of Toronto, and Georgia Tech.  He is the author of "Generalized Optimal Stopping and Financial Markets", published in Pitman Research Notes in Mathematics Series.

kaminski-v	 The Research Group:  It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today.  Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed.  We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An announcement will be forthcoming at a later date.  Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".  Sincerely,  Vince 
kaminski-v	 The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please  treat with discretion.  Executive Summary: ? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives.  Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from  an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation ? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of  out-of-state generators ? June 1st "kill clause" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional  plan ? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected  $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper  Administration involvement ? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling ? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout  deal  1. FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks  like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to  continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the  Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the  Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation.  It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan.   2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps  From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws: ? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west.  Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  California. ? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling. ? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion. ? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the  cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.  3. Proposal "Kill Clause" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a "kill clause" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the  regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the  regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "Bush price caps plan" collapse.  4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion  on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of  PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the  situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for  power.  The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about  90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.   The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to California.  The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months.  5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for  gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the   QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw   of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.   6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being  continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.  7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a   utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number  of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a  "non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is  no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be  used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According  to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private  company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for  the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not   stand a likely constitutional challenge.    8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term  power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.   Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged, creating an even further delay.

farmer-d	 I spoke to Mr. Maldinado this morning and it doesn't look good.  He claims he  has a connection to the Minister of "Energy" who will allocate gas to him.  I  asked where would the gas be delivered, and he said anywhere you want it.   Short term or long term?  Again, anything you want, but probably long term is  better.  I pointed out that there isn't an Energy Minister in Saudi and would he know  the name of the Minister whose giving him the gas?  He stumbled and couldn't  remember the name.  Finally he said "What do you have to lose?  Just send me a letter requesting  gas with the specs, location and duration" and he'll do his best to get it.    If you want to try it Rob, he's all yours.  His fax number is 562/866-7368,  address 16276 Grand Avenue, Bellflower, CA 90706.

He wasn=01,t expecting me to bring forth anything because = I had=20 just started. No one provided any information after the first day, so I=20 decided to look it up and do it myself. Tom was very pleased.  2. Tom gave that info to Ed, and he asked for further data:  a. About Cinco ranch, Greatwood, and Spring interconnects  I coordinated with Brad Blevins and applied it to the fact that origination= =20 was booked for Nov, but the points had yet to be operational. Brad and I=20 remain in close contact to share any Entex interconnect info.  b.

farmer-d	 It is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers,  however, If the pipeline allocates the shortage to ENA then we need to follow  the contract language and bill accordingly.  Just remember that we allowed  makeup  on the 18, 19, & 20th for a total volume of 5K over 3 days so that  will apply toward the 4th and part of the 9th.  All other volumes should be  purchased back  per the language in the contract.  Remember they have a  tolerance of 5% below the nomination.  Thanks, Janet

kaminski-v	 Stinson,  I think the gamma will flow into V@R.  Vince      Stinson Gibner 11/30/2000 06:14 PM To: Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek  Alex,  Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a  couple of additional changes.  1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike  payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be  discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values. 2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree  approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature  method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities. 3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for  anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation  since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.  Thanks,  Stinson

kaminski-v	 Stinson and Vince,  I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close  trading. The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open  price which will affect the P/L.  I also added the output features that John wants to see.  The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I  discussed  with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination).  Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?   Zimin

We felt a cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the  speaker series free for attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the  expenses anyway and we felt it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of  Rockwell International has confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is  handling the set up. September 20th Houston's Economy PanelPaul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas:  confirmed with sponsorshipShirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear  something this weekRobert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmedHarvey  Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmedTechnology: need someone.

San FranciscoAccording to Chrissy, the plans  include a ticket to the? game, dinner at Zydeco's and a trolley ride from  Zydeco's to the new Enron field. All this for only $25/person! Chrissy, if  you have the info, let's try to get it on the May 17th event mailing.  Summer 2000 Family EventSeveral members have expressed interest in a family  event. Chrissy and I are looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor  Theater). GBN will buy soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic  dinner.

beck-s	 Sally,  The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a  Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was  not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the  May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed  the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I  will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book  their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely  basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives  team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.  This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much  more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides  I am ready to come home.  Have a good weekend, Todd

kaminski-v	 Hi Mel  Further to our earlier discussions here's the full list of actions we'd like  to put into place regarding Anjam's departure:  HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1  is completed (cataloguing his work). 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next. 3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in  the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too. 5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail. 6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.  Vince has OK'd this lot, so let's do it ASAP.  Many thanks, Steve

farmer-d	 Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers  Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:  National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).    The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected:  1.
kaminski-v	 i've asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince's  group.  this issue needs to  be resolved by week's end--we look like we don't  have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to  make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new  wharton recruit disgruntled.  vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up  with our meeting with skilling?  thanks very much...  jeff

beck-s	 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.   Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are  appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I  split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had  discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units  and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the  accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs,  specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units  eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs,  outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for  specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this  cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business  and evaluate/manage our risks.  Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for  each group with these changes.    Regards Delainey 
kaminski-v	 The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has  prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in  London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the  London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk  and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk  activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new  assignment within  EBS, also in London.  The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.  As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it  is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent  and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will  accomplish that goal.  Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new  assignments.

beck-s	 Sally,  Over the past year or so Enron has made a great impact at the University of  Oklahoma.  In a very short time we have become one of the employers of of choice within the College of Business.  We have been able to do this by  paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary.  We have formed great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to  come, if we do not become complacent.  I for one am an example of the  impression that Enron has forged at OU.  I am here because I believe that Enron  represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry,  but the  but the business world in general.  I am sending this note because I believe we are taking steps that will lessen  our momentum at the University of Oklahoma.   I have learned that we will not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall.   As you  know, last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment  after our presentations.  Being a student at the time I felt this was a great  idea and I know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well.   They felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from Enron  representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided.  As I  understand the A/A program now takes the position that this does not provide  any residual value for Enron and does not warrant the expense.  I do not  understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an  arrangement.  It places another selling point on our presentation and gives  us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent.   This  may seem like an  insignificant detail,  but I hope we will see the value  that this opportunity presents.  The students of the EM Program and the J.C.  Penney Leadership Program are expecting another exciting evening from Enron  and hate to see us fall short of these expectations.  It is very likely that  if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will.  The competition  for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident  in our recruiting efforts.  Enron is a great place to work and we must take  that image to campus.   I know that Mr. McConnell is a very exciting speaker  and will no doubt amaze those present.  That is why we should take this  simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and  continue our path to recruiting dominance at the University of Oklahoma.  I am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting OU within  Enron's sights.  Your involvement at OU is greatly appreciated and I hope you  maintain your interest in the University of Oklahoma.  Please consider my views on  this matter and express any concerns of your own to the Analyst and Associate  Program.  Thank You,  Jody Crook    
kaminski-v	 Mike,  Please, draft a message to JS, DD and JL outlining the AGA benefits and costs. This will be their decision.  Vince       
beck-s	 As requested, I've created a list of people who: have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or I think would be a great asset to Enron.  I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it  useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If  you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact  them, just let me know.  Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management  practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client  related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit  and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.   I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend  him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to  travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not  interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807  0040.  Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in  Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for  Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for  15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader,  products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery  itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are  extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly  recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and  he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.   His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.  Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works  with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find  opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319  2000).  Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of  accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and  all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all  products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.   She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely  diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have  to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a  client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at  the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year  as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to  me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase,  and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that  she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713  277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it  due to the PwC/alliance relationship.  Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a  year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit  manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very  conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try!  (713 230 3000 general line).  Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred  over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing  what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her  at the general AA line.  Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not  know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the  audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).  Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best  senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have  ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of  work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked  for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent  evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of  the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working  on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office  processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of  PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to  manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1  this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will  be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to  continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith  to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His  number is 713 356 5617.  Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting  and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving  Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a  good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be  reachable through the general number for Koch.  Admin assistants  Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative  assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for  PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in  Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not  worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked  to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC  number).  Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave  PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on  how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

kaminski-v	 Iris:  I forwarded the information to Donna Lowry in our Compliance Dept.  However, I am afraid she had bad news.    Enron would sponsor the renewals, but the US Securities group does not recognize UK Securities exams without further testing here in the US.  She said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail.  But, from what I understand, you will need to take some exam here before renewing.  When you hear from her let me know.

kaminski-v	 Hello--Listen, wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest publication last week, The Risk Desk. Because of the size of the files we sent out, quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails over a certain size. Anyhow, if you didn't receive the issue, hit the reply button and type "resend Risk Desk." Responce so far has been great for those of you that received the free copy -- we think you'll agree that it's soon to become the leading "must read" publication on market, credit, price and operational risk management in the energy space.

beck-s	 By way of introduction, I am the director of global risk operations reporting  to Sally Beck.  One of my responsibilities is to help new Enron offices set  up risk control functions.  I have been speaking with Milind Laad and Heidi  Hellman, located in India, concerning the marketing and origination of coal,  liquid fuels, gas and power transacted by the Indian office.  I was wondering what your understanding of the Indian office's  trading/marketing/origination plans are as coal and liquids and what type of  trading authorizations you have given them to date.  I understand that any  coal deals done by India will be included in George's book and any liquids  deals done will be included in John's book.  Thanks,  Shona 713 853 9123

kaminski-v	 Anjam, thanks for organising this - and Vince thanks for making yourself  available for the discussion.  I am working for Joe Gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an  additional sales and communication channel for our European business units.  Through the web we are also able to convey a more local image, rather than  presenting ourselves as a Texan company through Enron.com. To set you into perspective about what we have in mind I have attached a  brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project.    We intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons: document our know-how base educate the market participants generate great stickiness (participants should know that if they need to know  s.th. on energy risk mgt. they should go to Enron) later on: have the option to commercialise this area.  I look forward to our discussion.  Kind regards Sven Becker

kaminski-v	 Naveen, the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio.  It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and  calculate "Expected Tail Loss". The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.  Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses  corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.  Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%  calculated with  1) simulations (100 thousand simulations); 2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)   1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity  portfolio.  3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to  approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for  example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%). The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5%  different from the correct number).  We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio  until we have proper methods implemented.        Tanya Tamarchenko 02/28/2001 01:17 PM To: Wenyao Jia/HOU/ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: "analytical" var implementation in RisktRAC    Debbie, I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of  "analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.  Here is why this effort is very important: 1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as  mentioned by Rick Buy) and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations; 2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to  the Board.  The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested  already so there will be no problems with the algorithm itself.  We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.  What do you think?  Tanya    
kaminski-v	 Hi Sandy:  Yes he does.  Actually in our group meeting today, Vince Kaminski said that he wants most of his group to have access.  I believe Stinson Gibner is working on the list.

kaminski-v	 I was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the number of simulations we use. This question, I think, is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve, because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway (here I mean the assumptions regarding price processes,  correlations, etc.)  This question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors. When the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve, what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity?    I performed a numerical experiment where I calculated the expected loss for a simple portfolio with one counterparty (SITHE IND POWER) for different number of simulations (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) using old research  credit model. You can see how the result converges and the relative error (compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate) in  the  attached file.  Tanya.    
kaminski-v	 Vince:     As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then about CDS, the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

kaminski-v	 Hi Stinson, Shales' initial in road to EBS was through David Cox (after  Vince's suggest to talk to David, I think).  What Shalesh did at the time was  to put a four page concept on trading storage as a commodity in the new  networked world.  He has keen interest in such an idea and has done some  work. He will be a good fit unless that person has to be in EBS under Jean  etc.... If so, we are not ready to let Shalesh go!  He can support that  effort, but I need him to get the supply & demand work in real-time user  friendly form for Jean's traders before Shalesh ventures onto something  else.  I did promising that I will get him involved in some juicy stuff like  new product/deals etc.... This may be his non-it stuff that he can do.....  What do you think?  Ravi.

beck-s	 I agree fully with the last sentence.  E mail is not an appropriate forum to  discuss an issue like this.  This may be somewhat moot given Fernley's latest  e mail but I believe this warrants direct communication.  Fernley, I would  suggest you set up a discussion that would include this group and may grow to  include AA at some point to get their perspective directly.  As I have  indicated before, I believe Barry is a valuable asset but may need some more  managing.     Ted Murphy@ECT 02/09/2000 12:32 PM To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Fernley, On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage  who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for  doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.   Subsequently, Richard was "moved" from his position and Barry promoted.   If  that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your  credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back  office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London  by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely  mistaken.  On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John  Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily  completing the Audit tasks from London. I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed  my "advice" and you need to do what you need to do. If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out  of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a  responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to  surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will  be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money  trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere. Need I go on.  Let us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose. Ted    Fernley Dyson 02/09/2000 04:56 AM To: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Ted,  We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on  specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and  prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and  the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has  changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality  risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary  recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).   Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the  Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I  suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -  his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his  considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult  to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to  address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this  issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable"  offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management  style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and  objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)  with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a  different story to tell on Helsinki.  As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',  although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks  back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy  to contribute staff to this too.  Regards  Fernley     To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Fernley, As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I  think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  "prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal. Ted    Fernley Dyson 02/08/2000 04:07 PM To: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Trading Support Operations - London  Rick,  Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support  function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we  already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.  The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.

Just last week, I got admission from U. of Chicago MBA program, so did Yvan,  by the way.  Now, I am applying loan from Enron A/A pool. The person who is in charge of this told me that it needs three  recommendations from current boss and previous boss for the application, and  that the requirement includes all PRC rankings in either 'excellent' or  'superior', that I didn't achieve in the first rotation in Research.  Getting loan is cricial at the stage. I wonder if you can be one of my  recommenders. This will be a big help.  Thank you.  Li x39635

However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day  one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.   Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale  so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume  being billed to us by Pan Energy.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  F.Y.I  ---------------------- Forwarded by Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT on 09/20/2000  02:28 PM ---------------------------   Stinson Gibner 09/20/2000 02:28 PM To: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: "Enron Day" to be declared in Spearman, Texas  Cindy,  You may or may not remember that I sent a short note to you last May  outlining a fundraising effort for the Hansford County Library in Spearman,  Texas.   The community was challenged to raise $20,000 which I offered to  match 2 to 1.   With Enron foundations employee match, this grows to a total  mathching ratio of $4 for every $1 raised by the community.  (Of course,  because of the $15,000/year limit, I have to spread my gifts over several  years in order to get the total amount matched by Enron.)  Sherry Benton, the librarian in Spearman just called and gave me the great  news that the $20,000 in community donations has been achieved.   In fact, I  expect that the total community number will come to almost $25,000 once all  of the donations are received.  In order to recognize our part in all this, the mayor of the town is planning  to declare October 17th as "Stinson Gibner and Enron Day" in Spearman, and  they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition.    There will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and,  possibly, by the Amarillo newspaper as well.      They are asking if a representative from Enron (other than myself) would be  interested in coming to Spearman for this event.    Please let me know if you  or anyone else would be interested in doing this.    Spearman is about a 90  minute drive north from the airport in Amarillo, and it is possible to get  there and back to Houston on the same day.  Thanks,  Stinson Gibner x34748  P.S. Is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $15,000/year  matching cap so that I can have $40,000 matched in just two years instead of  three?     ---------------------- Forwarded by Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT on 09/20/2000  02:01 PM ---------------------------   Stinson Gibner 05/05/2000 11:47 AM To: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Thanks  Cindy,    I just received notification of Enron's match of my $8000 donation to the  Hansford County Library in Spearman, Texas.   (All old pipeline hands know  Spearman because both Northern Natural and Transwestern pipelines run near by  the city.)       You may be interested to know what I am trying to accomplish there.  The  Library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of Texas  as it is owned neither by the county nor city.   It's budget is met through a  combination of city, county, and private contributions.   A big part of their  income comes from the "Thrift Shop,"   Spearman's version of the Blue Bird  Circle.   In order to help the Library continue to provide quality services  to the community (our library in Spearman, population 3000, is by all  accounts much better than the one in nearby Perryton, population 15000),  I  am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund.    We have set a  goal of raising $100,000 over the next 3 years.   With Enron's matching, I am  planning to provide about $80,000 of that amount with the other $20,000  coming from contributions from others in the local community.  I am also investigating if the Library can get any type of matching grant  from other foundations, but it looks like most prefer to fund specific  projects rather than put funds towards endowments.

kaminski-v	 Krishna,  I have received two additional  requests for help from EES.  1. Jeremy Blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the  level of our support of EES.

kaminski-v	 Dear all,  Attached is a paper describing the proposed methodology for pricing the  "Bankruptcy Swaps" the Credit Markets group is launching next week. The  methodology is intentionally simplistic - the emphasis has been on providing  transparent models to give prices in a quick, easy-to-understand manner,  rather than create any new "rocket science". Could one or all of you please  review the paper, and give feedback on the approach and advice on the areas  still under development. This will give us peace-of-mind before the big  launch.  Bryan - could you reread this and outline the sections that need omitting or  expanding for publication on the website.    Many thanks,  Ben

farmer-d	 Friday 1/19/01 - Received a call from Sheila at Basin regarding a well which  may be coming on this weekend (meter 9696).  Phone Lee in Gas Control  regarding same.  Lee informed me that HPL would prefer that the volumes are  not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are  no liquids involved.  Lee further informed me that the same day to Tejas at  Hardy was not in the system, and, per Gary Hanks, needed to be corrected.   Lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10M at Hardy/Tejas and  10M at Lomax.  I went into Sitara and updated the deal ticket, pathed and  nominated over to Pops.  Saturday 1/20/01 - 8:30 am  Sean paged regarding the nomination at Dow  Freeport, he was questioning the validity, as we do not often flow at this  meter.  I checked and the nomination was good for Saturday's gas day.  Sean  informed me that the Valero Refinery was up and down and would be going  completely down on Sunday.  10:00 am  - Sean called regarding Tejas LaPorte, meter 665.  Apparently, the  meter had a confirmed volume of 20M and HPL/ENA had no deal at the meter.   Checked in POPS and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20M on a deal  volume of zero.  Informed Sean that the Tejas volume was confirmed.  Also,  per Sean Koch George West (meter 6722) had a nomination increase of 10M,  which he wanted to confirm.  Sunday 1/21/01  10:00 am  Sean paged regarding the Dow meter 1442, Pops still  showed a confirmed voume of 10M which Dow and Oasis showed at zero for  Sunday.  I  checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at  zero and phoned Sean back to confirm.  Checked on MTP Hardy, Sean informed me  that we came in on rate for Saturday and that current meter activity looked  good.

Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in; this process seems to be taking forever. I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50, which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected. I appreciate your help. Thanks. -Samer    
kaminski-v	 Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).   -----Original Message----- From:

kaminski-v	 Vince,  UK VAR breached the limit last week. UK traders asked us to review the correlations across UK gas and power as  well as the correlations across EFA slots. We did part of the work last week. Now we'll update the correlations based on historical prices.  Tanya.     Richard Lewis 10/08/2000 07:31 AM To: Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven  Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT,  Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted  Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Simon Hastings/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul D'Arcy/LON/ECT@ECT, Amir  Ghodsian/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios    Thanks Tanya, these are interesting results.  I am on vacation next week, so  here are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.  Gas to power correlations  I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the  combined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a  conservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than  previously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly  speaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we  were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.    A suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK  Gas and Power books-  can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in  portfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?  Also, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power  correlation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total  VAR by o1.8mm.  EFA slot correlations The issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is  a separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA  correlations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical  correlations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would  suggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is  worth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important  these correlations are.  Closing thoughts Friday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on  Monday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd  like to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday  week) before finalising this.   Regards  Richard      Tanya Tamarchenko 06/10/2000 22:59 To: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James  New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee  Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market  Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios    Everybody, Oliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power  portfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.  First, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas  curves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only  the aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the  fact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method, which accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change  the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers, we get slightly different result from the model.  So: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power  we should look at the aggregate number.  I calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the  weights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and  volatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results  are shown below:   Inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced  negatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine.  Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by  definition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based  on any historical data. Here, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with  correlations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec  versus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In  addition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see  the VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the  correlations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix. I obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen  using Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as  well as in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does.   Concluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to  calculate historical correlations from them.  Tanya.     Oliver Gaylard 10/06/2000 01:50 PM To: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven  Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT,  Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, David  Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: VaR correlation scenarios  The results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:  Correlation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book  0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM  0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM  0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM  0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM  0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)  1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)   Peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's  integrity.   Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR  increases which is counter to intuition.  This implies that we need to look  into how the correlations are being applied within the model. Once we can  derive single correlations from the term structure, is the next action to  understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the P+L  volatility in the spread option deals.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two  groups that a subscription to the "Institute for International Finance" is  worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the  cost.  Is a $16K share OK for your group?  We'll do $32K on our end, and then  try and sell some of our share to my European counterpart once he gets better  established with a bigger budget. --Scott ---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Tholan/Corp/Enron on 02/26/2001  06:21 PM ---------------------------   Robert Johnston@ECT 02/26/2001 07:51 AM To: Scott Tholan/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Re: IIF/OxAn  Scott- could you give Vince a call or an email to recommend that he kick in  16K for the Institute for International Finance?

Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more  users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per  year.  We can charge $10K back to you.  On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here  I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of  our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.  Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of  sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I  need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.  Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on  your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our  colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and  John Sherriff on that project from London.  RJ

kaminski-v	 Hi guys  A number of us interviewed a guy named Matthew Williams last week for an  Analyst position.  He has a PhD in particle physics and experience with monte  carlo simulation (albeit in FORTRAN77) from his academic work.  He's also a  good communicator, having completed a postgrad course in acting, and has been  active in the theatre as performer and director.  If he accepts our job offer then (after discussion with Dale and Bryan) we've  decided to give him his first rotation in Research here in London.  I hope he  accepts.  I'll keep you posted.  Steve 
farmer-d	 Daren,  We are working with Mark McCoy on getting some things repathed in the  system.  It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify  just the deliveries -not sure why????.  We have been paying the suppliers  based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller  number than what we have in Unify.  Also, we have not been able to get a  contact for the allocation statement.  In some cases, we get the summary  sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.  Do you  know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on  a timely and consistent basis?  The contacts on the allocation statements  that we do have are not returning phone calls.  I also need to know what was  the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that  we need from you, I will call you.

farmer-d	 Please respond to Hi Bubba!  Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.  Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed". Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw

I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31st) of  each month.  This may work better than hand delivering.  Let me know what you think.

farmer-d	 I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month.  To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.  So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.  If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.       Elsa Villarreal 03/15/2001 02:42 PM To:

I'm really trying to get commitment from business sponsors (principally Mike  on this side) on both sides of the pond to agree a common timetable for  functionality.  If we don't get this, it may be difficult for us to maintain  a common database across Houston and London, and IT will end up acting as a  broker between different business areas when establishing priorities.

But in order to establish what could  potentially be delivered by July 2001, we were inquiring as to the data  elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality.  It would  be hard to make committments to use an application, without really knowing  what it does.  Clarification was what we were trying to get and will require,  to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these  applications fit or do not fit our business.    I received a functional spec for Envoice today and would like to get one for  DTL and Enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and  possible enhancements that could be added on later.  I am sorry if my queries caused some "ripples".   I still would like some  tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications.   Please let me know what information you can supply us.   Thanks    Cindy    John Paskin 04/09/2000 12:30 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve Whitaker/LON/ECT@ECT, Scott  Williamson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Horn/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Wisemiller/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Dragan Jojic/LON/ECT@ECT, Phil Yoxall/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve  Price/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Samuel/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Enlighten Common Timetable  Dear all  There is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by  Enlighten.  Some clarification and a question:  Clarification: Enlighten (certainly in London) is actually a data hub, rather than an  application.  In itself, it will not add business value.  However, the tools  which sit on top of this system will add business value.  These tools are  currently DTL, Envoice, Zebra.  However, I think we all anticipate more  requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer.  Question (for business sponsors): We are trying hard to coordinate US and UK efforts.  However, this will be  extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same.   Say - for example - Mike wants Enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by  then end of 2000 but Cindy instead wants a full DPR in the same timeline.   Our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their  work if we are working for two separate sets of masters.  So:  If we are really to reap the rewards of a UK/US implementation, a common  timetable is extremely important.  Who are our primary UK and US business  sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ?  I suspect if we  are to try and make this a joint development, nothing will make delivery  harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of  requirements from our user communities.    Comments/answers please...  Cheers  John       
farmer-d	 Our CEO was contacted by a David Gardner, president of Gardner Energy in Houston regarding a five-year package of gas.  I spoke to him only briefly but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal.  Do you know of this firm?  I was unable to pull up anything on the internet.  I suspect he's just a marketer.  Don't spend any time on this.  I was just curious as to whether or not you know of him or his firm.  Thanks.

kaminski-v	 Cindy,  I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke, not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world  would  attract attention.  Vince     From: Cindy Derecskey@ENRON on 10/12/2000 03:55 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael B Rosen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark  Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Power Play Book    Vince,   You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we  don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my  recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a  rebuttal for the following reasons:  As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com  and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr.  Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may  not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw  more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving. I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with  counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have  not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's  Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.  Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient  for me to borrow the book from you.  Regards,  Cindy

farmer-d	 As a follow up to my message last week on charges for Analysts, I am  attaching the file that Financial Operations used to charge your RC with the  $6,400 in monthly costs that I detailed below.  I have received a few calls  and E-mails stating that some reclasses need to be made because you no longer  have an analyst in your group.  The information used by Financial Operations  to charge your RC was obtained from the Org Database.  Please review the  attached files for January and February to ensure that the proper RC was and  is going to be charged.  If you have any corrections, please contact Brian  Heinrich at Ext. 5-7677 ASAP since journal entries will need to be processed  by this Friday, March 3rd.  If you have any questions, please call me.  I just want to let everyone know  that it is important that we continue to keep the Org Database updated as  changes are made.  It is and will continue to be the source of headcount  information for Energy Operations.  Thank you for your continued support in  this process.

The analyst  program is being handled differently than it was in 1999.  In addition to the  normal salary, benefits and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an  overhead administration fee for the program.  You will be charged the  following MONTHLY amounts for each analyst in the Detail Class code that I  have indicated below:  Detail Class  Description   Amount       1  Salaries and Wages                   $4,000         552  Benefits                         774         557  Payroll Taxes                         360         820  Corporate Services                      1,266     Total MONTHLY Cost                   $6,400   The $4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not  indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid.  This amount will not change in  February as the $4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000.  The $1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program,  including campus recruiting and office visits.  When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled  "A and A  Reclass" in each of the Detail Classes identified above.  Enron North America  is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts.  Financial Operations  makes a manual Journal Entry each month to charge the appropriate RC.  Please  check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for  the correct number of analysts you have currently.  If there are any errors,  please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich  to have it corrected in February.  Please continue to check your RC report  each month going forward.  Thanks.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Lisa Cousino x3-6343

Version 5 will be.  The PC Version 4.0 can be installed on a network drive and called from networked PCs.  As expected, we would ask that Enron honor the license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted by the license.  Version 5.0 will be license managed and can be licensed as node locked or floating.  With regard to Unix licensing, the current version of CNL for Unix is license managed.  It can be licensed as node locked or floating.  If you install the libraries on a Unix server as node locked, the number of simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the capabilities of the machine.  A floating Unix license would be checked out by the individual user to be executed on a local machine.  Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and desired platforms.  This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered under support.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to help you solve your problems and understand your data.

There are two wells connected to system 429, which flows into the Big Cowboy system and interconnects with HGPL at Meter 8284.  They are meters 986679 (currently in Trade Zone 18) and 986742 (Currently in Trade Zone 1).  I think that these should probably both be reassigned to Trade Zone 21.  This should resolve our volumetric issue.  Donna & George,  Please let me know if my assumption is in error.  I have a schematic that shows these meters going to HGPL off of GEPL Big Cowboy, however, if this is not correct then I will need to try to find the gas in another manner.  Thank you for your time.  Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, suggestions.  Mary  35251 
beck-s	 Since we couldn't get us all together on the phone (Sally, you're out of the  office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all been  having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see several  alternatives:  Our Needs: 1) Database Management 2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report  No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep  database.    Our Goals: The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in  fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of  being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk  Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his  understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should  select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.  If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most  efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the  way to get there.  Alternatives: 1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them  in planning, interviews, etc.    - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are  experienced managers/directors who would only   be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business;  it is also a management problem for his staff to be   under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement    Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them  documenting the findings in the report    - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?       Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of "brains" - we just need brawn    -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to  target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.    - planning and oversight with 3 groups "in charge" is inefficient and  could cause accountability question  2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead,  consider one of the following:  A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and  write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to   do the deal test       Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can  benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no    issue with managing staff, etc.;     Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote?    B) Outsource to AA    Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house  expertise, expensive,     C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk  Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or  accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.   Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep  to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends on  what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome  the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we  afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group  with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface,  we can do that instead.  Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans.    Regards, Cassandra.

kaminski-v	 Vince,  Thank you so much for meeting with me Friday morning about the Research  Group.    After leaving your office, I remembered an issue I have had with the Analyst  & Associate Program that might be of interest to you.  During a Texas A&M recruiting meeting, I learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science.  I wondered why math majors were  not mentioned, and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors.  Like liberal arts majors, they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis.  In my opinion, math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors, and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well (I did last summer, and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year.)  I think that Enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort.    At Texas A&M the Career Center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting, and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center.  I sent my resume to Enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus.  However, many other math majors had not heard  of Enron or the other companies, and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like Enron.  Many math majors want to continue their  education, become teachers,  or work for an actuarial firm.  However, many  are undecided.  We are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff, but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment.  By not mentioning math majors to the career center (a very  simple and inexpensive step), Enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people.  While it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about Enron  already, had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly, and went the extra step to send Enron their  resume outside the career center system, there are many qualified students  who do not do this, and opt for other companies who DID mention math majors.  I called a manager in the A&A program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers.  I realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them, talk to teachers, and attend math society  events.  However, I told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for Enron.  She reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors, and that if more upper level people began requesting them,  it would be considered.  I searched for "mathematics" on the Enron job  website, and had a surprising number of results.  I know that your group  could use math majors as well.  However, this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the A&A recruiting department.  I just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed.  Thanks, Heather Johnson x53240

beck-s	 Sally, at the beginning of the new year, you expressed your desire to have a  report developed which captured all new hires for Energy Operations weekly.   This report needed to include all transfers in and out of Energy Operations  as well.  After speaking to Alexus about your request, she had indicated that  she may have a report already developed to meet your needs.  I encouraged her  to speak to you regarding any additional details that that may be needed.   Alexus agreed to follow up to further assess your needs.  Please let me know  how I may help with the process.

beck-s	 We have created two new graphs that will be published daily along with the  DPR.  For each business unit or commodity group in the DPR the graphs show the VaR  compared to its limit.    When VaR is under the limit (as in the example on the right), it appears  green, and the unused portion of the limit appears yellow, which together add  up to the limit amount.  When VaR exceeds the limit (as on the left), the  limit is represented in red, and the excess is shown as a red box outlined in  black.  One graph shows usage in dollar terms and the other as a percentage  of the individual limits.  We should be able to publish this graph to the web report viewer as soon as  the web masters have completed the set up.  Meanwhile, we will e-mail these  graphs to you every day after the DPR is finalized.  Today's are attached  below.  Please launch the Excel file instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer.  Over the past several months we have been putting together a database to  standardize and capture the information that flows to the DPR (it is very  much like the database we created for EOL to report numbers).  With it we can  perform a variety of analyses (correlations between books, back-testing,  estimating sensitivities to risk factors, P&L decomposition and attribution,  etc.).  We are nearly finished with its construction, and we hope to provide  you superior analytics and reports in the future.  Next week we hope to publish two new graphs: for each business unit in the  DPR one will have 30 day rolling and 5 day rolling ROVARs (average P&L  divided by average VaR) and the other will have 30 day rolling and 5 day  rolling curve shift Sharpe ratios (average delta - gamma P&L divided by its  standard deviation) .  We hope you find these useful.  Regards,    Eugenio Perez Risk Analytics Energy Operations

kaminski-v	 Hi Vince, I have been working on and/or planning to work on the following projects: 1.  Finished a gas daily swing option model for commodity structuring  group (Sanjeev Khanna).  The model uses American Monte Carlo  Simulation and dynamic programming techniques.   2. Continue working on PSIM model. This includes reading power generation and operation books as well as thinking about ways to model power plant and its operation. The standard approach (i.e. turn the plant on if power  price>total generation cost, else turn the plant off) is not particularly good if the  regional demand is very high and the plant still has some un-utilized generation  capacity. That is, the generation criteria is quite different depending on we model  power  plant from regional point view or from plant point of view.  Plan to have  meetings with Tom and Lance.   3.  Started working on stochastic process parameter estimation.  I will  concentrate on four processes: GBM, mean reverting, jump diffusion, and jump diffusion  with mean reverting.  I have looked at Tanya's earlier  work and decided to  discretize the processes slightly differently.  It is hoped that this will give a more  stable estimation.   Best, Alex

kaminski-v	 Vince-  I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the "transaction dollars"  on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index  trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently,  recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the  contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis  trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to  them of the "price" as the basis, times the quantity.  I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy  very seriously.  Clayton

The below note is simply a PR exercise from John Sherriff to remind people  throughout Europe ( and especially in Commercial groups ) that fundamental  standards exist and must be followed ( He believes the message should be sent  given the turnover in staff and recent arrival of Metals to Enron Europe ).;  I am keen that the basis of the note IS consistent with our global views and  underpins our global reporting !!

I  would like to apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused. I will  be  responsible for a number of events on credit risk management, real  options  theory, exotic options and weather risk management in the second  half of the  year and will send a calendar to give more notice for these  events. Victoria  Kerridge will be producing our largest annual energy event  in Europe and I  have forwarded your details for a possible presentation and  post-conference  seminar opportunity. If you have any questions please drop  me a  line. ? Best  wishes, ?

farmer-d	 The MeOH plant  began having problems on June 30. On July 3, a flange fire on  piping occurred.  The piping could not be depressured and the plant was shut  down.  No eta for plant startup is available at this time.  Additional  information will be forwarded when available. 
kaminski-v	 Hi Kate,  Thanks for setting up the telephone informal discussion with Sharad so that I  can make him more comfortable with what's on offer - I really think it will  make the difference.  As you mentioned, the agency fee goes up from 25% to  30% at 50,000, hence the offer of 49,000.  I guess, as you mentioned, we can  keep in reserve the possibility of an element of sign on bonus to get him  over the decision hump.  Regards & Thanks,  Anjam 
kaminski-v	 Title: A Colossal and Dangerous Failure URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2185   Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to= =20 date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State= =20 Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what = he=20 perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor= =20 labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous= =20 failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20 billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20 generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20 transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny = of=20 existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for= =20 the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants.  The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20 steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin= g=20 sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20 stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to=  go=20 bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi= al=20 community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid= e=20 financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20 Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to= =20 guarantee their solvency.  The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for= =20 what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the= =20 wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20 state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their= =20 operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever= e=20 sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh= at=20 investigators find as unreasonable profits.  A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr= ess=20 indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a= n=20 energy crisis. Although the 33 percent growth in the state=01,s economy ove= r the=20 past ten years has nearly outstripped the state=01,s and surrounding region= =01,s=20 supplies of power, the bulk of the governor=01,s statements continue to foc= us on=20 the culpability of power producers, rather than the serious supply shortfal= l.  Though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the constructio= n=20 of new generating plants, increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of= =20 sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers= =20 and the financial community that the investment climate in California is=20 excessively risky.   **end**  Follow above URL for complete report.  ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, "Shooting the Rapids:=20 Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future" in Houston, February 12-16,=20 2001!

My phone number is (617) 492-9551.    I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came  straight to MIT for a Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics, optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran, and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about.  Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week.  Paulo   Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet   Objective:  To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet.   Motivation:  This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices. Furthermore, companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to.  The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g. VCRs or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about.  The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services.   Research Strategy:  Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These components are choice models and optimization models.   Choice Models:  Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains. These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models. The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet.  Optimization:  Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component (learning).

Price:  One part rate, $0.2175/Dth, plus applicable fuel  Primary Receipt/Delivery Points: (East - to -East Transport)  Receipt: La Plata Pool (use San Juan, Blanco price equivalent)  Delivery: Waha area   Option:  Alternate Delivery Pnt.:  California Border (East - to- West Transport)  Price:  Floor-  $0.2175/Dth, plus 4.75% pipeline fuel, plus 50% of the difference  between the California Border index   price and the San Juan Basin index price.  Specifically, we'll use:       (SoCalGas large pkgs. minus TW (Ignacio, pts. south))  An important things to consider: This option is only for Alternate Firm deliveries.  Alternate firm is really  just a glorified version of interruptible.  Can you run the option model and tell me what is the dollar value of this  rather "unpure" option?  I appreciate it.  Give me a call at 3-1521 if you have any questions.  Also,  can you get us an answer by Friday, 10/13/00?  We're looking to get the  proposal out to the customer by the end of the week if possible.  Thanks.      
kaminski-v	 Kim:  The interviews conducted on February 2 are just exploratory interviews to see where Punit might fit within Enron.  Vince thought he might fit in John's group.   The title and $$ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he should be (if at all).  If John is interested after the interview, then he and Vince can get together to discuss $$ and title.  If you or John have any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks!

kaminski-v	 Did you guys get this?  I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the President's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the customers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.  I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.  Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers (including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower bid prices.

kaminski-v	 A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.  He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support  of other members of my group with skills in different areas.  Vince Kaminski 
kaminski-v	 Bryan,  I am glad we could help. Let me talk to Vasant about Amitava's support for you.  Vince      Bryan Seyfried 11/05/2000 05:26 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Markus Fiala/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Amitava's visit  Really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the  quantitative work we have undertaken.  As you are aware much of the work  requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the  significant contribution that Amitava's experience and expertise has provided  in a very short timeframe.  As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated  support from someone with Amitava's background.  It is imperative that we  leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights  into our project.  This will not only speed up the work considerably but also  ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.  I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more  integrated into our efforts.  I realize it will be difficult to free him up  but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.  some early ideas:    have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support.  this  should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant  effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC.com  resource working from Houston.  This is likely my preference.  or  agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical  insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract  his experience on an ongoing basis.  Let's discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities  Thanks for your assistance.

farmer-d	 To clarify the memo that I sent yesterday concerning Buyer vs. Seller on  Intercompany deals, I want to make sure that everyone understands that not  only will the Seller side post on the SITARA deal but that the Volume  Feedback Reconciliation report  will reflect the error(s) associated with the  buy side as well.  It will no longer show the the error(s) generated by the  sales side as it currently does.  This change will coincide with the way SAP  reports Intercompany transactions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Note: The Volume Feedback Reconciliation report is the report which I  distribute on a daily basis.  Thanks, RHP    ---------------------- Forwarded by Regina Perkins/HOU/ECT on 02/04/2000  10:20 AM ---------------------------   Regina Perkins 02/03/2000 05:32 PM To: Edward Terry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Katherine L Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, George  Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary M Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim  Homco/HOU/ECT@ECT, Randall L Gay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON,  Bryce Baxter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Nelson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Regina Perkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Francis S  Lim/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Buyer vs. Seller on Intercompany Deals  It has been brought to my attention that SAP will not use the Buyer as the  governing value associated with Intercompany deals but the Seller.   Currently, SITARA captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the  sales side.  I wanted to make sure that those of you who would be impacted by  the change were aware of how SITARA would reflected the volumes associated  with Intercompany deals.  If there are any concerns with this, please let me  know as soon as possible.  I will need to have an adjustment made to the  Volume Feedback Reconciliation report to reflect this change once it has been  finalized.   It may be a month or two before this is implemented but I wanted  to make sure everyone had advance notice.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at X39222.  Thanks, RHP

kaminski-v	 Hi Paul/Cassim,  Further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options, that we may use to  capture short-term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or  broken, I have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the  value.  ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTION The first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average  of the Q2-Q3 swap into a volatility equivalent.  This is achieved by fitting  a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard  deviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed  yesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as  approximately 23%.    PRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY The pricing is as for a regular Asian option.  The payoff depends on the  average of the daily prices for Spanish power for Q2 and Q3.  The valuation  using 23% volatility is showing about 15.3 Pta per kWh.  I will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward.  Regards,  Anjam x35383  SPREADSHEET:
